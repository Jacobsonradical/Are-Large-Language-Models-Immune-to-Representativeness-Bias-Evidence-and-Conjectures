To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(X|A) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(A) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- P(X|B) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(B) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B.

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

We can calculate the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O for each deck:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296296
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(A|X) = (0.296296 * 0.5) / (0.296296 * 0.5 + 0.074074 * 0.5) = 0.8

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
