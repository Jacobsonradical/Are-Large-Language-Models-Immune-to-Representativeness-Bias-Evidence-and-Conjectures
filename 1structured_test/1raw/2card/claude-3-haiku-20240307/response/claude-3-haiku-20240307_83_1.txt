To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:
Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741
P(A) = 0.5 (as the decks are selected by chance)
P(B) = 0.5 (as the decks are selected by chance)

Posterior odds = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.0741 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
