To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B as B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,X,X,O) / P(B|X,X,X,O))

Where:
- P(A|X,X,X,O) is the probability of Deck A given the observed data (3 X, 1 O)
- P(B|X,X,X,O) is the probability of Deck B given the observed data (3 X, 1 O)

To calculate these probabilities, we can use the given information about the composition of the decks.

P(A|X,X,X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|X,X,X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Simplifying the calculations, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,X,X,O) / P(B|X,X,X,O)) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
