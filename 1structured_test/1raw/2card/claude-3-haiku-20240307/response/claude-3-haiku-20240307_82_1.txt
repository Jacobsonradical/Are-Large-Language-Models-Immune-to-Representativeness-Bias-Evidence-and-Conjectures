To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck B)
- Observed data: 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card drawn

We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, which is:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)] / P(3X,1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of observing 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card given each deck is:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)] = 1

{odds: 1}

The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B are 1 to 1, or even odds.
