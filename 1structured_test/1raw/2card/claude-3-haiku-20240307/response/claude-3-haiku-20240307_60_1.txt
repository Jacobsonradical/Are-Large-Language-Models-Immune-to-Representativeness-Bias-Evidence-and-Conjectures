To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O), we can use the following formulas:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can simplify the calculation:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * 0.5) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * 0.5) / P(3X, 1O)

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))
            = ((P(3X, 1O|A) * 0.5) / P(3X, 1O)) / ((P(3X, 1O|B) * 0.5) / P(3X, 1O))
            = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the given probabilities:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)) = 1

So, the answer in the required format is:

{odds: 1}
