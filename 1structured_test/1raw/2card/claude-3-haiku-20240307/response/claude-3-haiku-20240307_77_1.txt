To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

We can simplify this expression by assuming that the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, since the decks were selected by chance.

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)

Now, we need to calculate the probabilities P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B).

For Deck A:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 3}
