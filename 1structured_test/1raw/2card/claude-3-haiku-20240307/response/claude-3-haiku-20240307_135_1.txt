To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B
- D: the observed data of 3 X cards and 1 O card

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

We need to calculate the following probabilities:
1. P(D|A): the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
2. P(D|B): the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
3. P(A) and P(B): the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

1. P(D|A):
   - Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
     - 3 X cards out of 4 cards drawn = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
   - Therefore, P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

2. P(D|B):
   - Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
     - 3 X cards out of 4 cards drawn = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
   - Therefore, P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

3. P(A) and P(B):
   - Since the decks are selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
             = (8/27) / (2/27)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
