To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X, 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Assuming that the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we need to calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
