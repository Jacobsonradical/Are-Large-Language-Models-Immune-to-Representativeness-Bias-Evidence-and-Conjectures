To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

The posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O), we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1
P(B|3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))
             = ((4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1) / ((4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1)
             = (2^3 × (2/3)^2) / (2^3 × (1/3)^2)
             = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 8}
