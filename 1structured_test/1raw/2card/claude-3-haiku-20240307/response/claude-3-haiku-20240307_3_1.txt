To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the four cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The four cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The four cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck B)
- The four cards drawn: 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O

We can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probabilities P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, the posterior odds can be simplified as:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
Posterior odds = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 8}
