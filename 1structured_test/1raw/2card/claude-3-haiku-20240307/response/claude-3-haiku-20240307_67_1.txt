To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The posterior odds of A vs. B is given by:
Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where P(A|data) and P(B|data) are the posterior probabilities, and P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, the posterior odds become:
Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data))

We need to calculate P(A|data) and P(B|data).

P(A|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / P(data)
P(B|data) = (P(data|B) * P(B)) / P(data)

Since P(data) is the same for both, we can simplify the calculation:
Posterior odds = (P(data|A) / P(data|B))

P(data|A) = Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
P(data|B) = Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

Calculating the probabilities:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Posterior odds = (P(data|A) / P(data|B)) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 3}.
