To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: The 3 cards are marked X.
- O: The 1 card is marked O.

The posterior odds of A compared to B is given by:
Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of A given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of B given the observed data.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of A and B, respectively.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(A) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(B) = 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X|A) * P(O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|A) * P(O|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(O|B) * P(B))
P(B|X,O) = (P(X|B) * P(O|B) * P(B)) / (P(X|A) * P(O|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(O|B) * P(B))

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))
Posterior odds = ((2/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) / (1/3 * 2/3 * 1/3)) * (2/3 / 1/3)
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 4}
