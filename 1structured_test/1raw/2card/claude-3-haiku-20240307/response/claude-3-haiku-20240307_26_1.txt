To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The 3 cards marked X
- O: The 1 card marked O

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probabilities:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963

The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))
            = (0.2963 / 0.0741) * (1/2) / (1/2)
            = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
