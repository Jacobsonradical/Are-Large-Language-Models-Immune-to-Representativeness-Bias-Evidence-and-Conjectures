To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

We are given the following information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)
- We have observed 3 X cards and 1 O card drawn from one of the decks.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the multinomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)) = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 8}
