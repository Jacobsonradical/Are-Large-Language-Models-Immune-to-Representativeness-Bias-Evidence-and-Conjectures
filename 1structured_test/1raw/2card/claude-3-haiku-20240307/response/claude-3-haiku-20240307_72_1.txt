To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck B)
- P(3 X, 1 O | A) = 3C3 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296 (probability of getting 3 X and 1 O, given they were drawn from Deck A)
- P(3 X, 1 O | B) = 3C3 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.148 (probability of getting 3 X and 1 O, given they were drawn from Deck B)
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3 X, 1 O) / P(B|3 X, 1 O)
= (P(3 X, 1 O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3 X, 1 O | B) * P(B))
= (0.296 * 1/2) / (0.148 * 1/2)
= 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
