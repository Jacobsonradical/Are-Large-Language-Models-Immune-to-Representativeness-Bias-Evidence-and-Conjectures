To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), the posterior odds can be calculated as:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
