To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards are drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards are drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds, P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)

To calculate the probabilities, we need to know the following:
P(X|A) = (3/4)^3 * (1/4) = 81/256
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/216
P(A) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
P(B) = 1/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)

Substituting the values, we get:
Posterior odds = (P(A|X) * P(A)) / (P(B|X) * P(B))
Posterior odds = ((81/256) * (2/3)) / ((8/216) * (1/3))
Posterior odds = (81 * 2) / (8 * 1)
Posterior odds = 162/8
Posterior odds = 20.25

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 20.25}
