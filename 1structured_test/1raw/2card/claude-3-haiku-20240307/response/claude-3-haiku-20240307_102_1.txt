To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck B)
- 3 cards are drawn as X and 1 card is drawn as O

To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the likelihoods:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8

The posterior odds are then given by:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1 (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2).

Posterior odds = 8 * 1 = 8

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 8}
