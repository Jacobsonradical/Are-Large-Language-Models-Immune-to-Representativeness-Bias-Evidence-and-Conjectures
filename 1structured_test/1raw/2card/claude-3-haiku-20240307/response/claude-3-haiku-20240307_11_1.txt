To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|XOO) / P(B|XOO)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|XOO) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, given the observation of 3 Xs and 1 O.
- P(B|XOO) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck B, given the observation of 3 Xs and 1 O.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = P(A|XOO) / P(B|XOO)

To calculate P(A|XOO) and P(B|XOO), we can use the probabilities of observing 3 Xs and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B.

P(A|XOO) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
P(B|XOO) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.1481

Posterior odds = P(A|XOO) / P(B|XOO) = 0.2963 / 0.1481 = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
