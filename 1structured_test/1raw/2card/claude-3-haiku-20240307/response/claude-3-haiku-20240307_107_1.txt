To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 of the 4 cards drawn are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A versus B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 8/27
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 4/27

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
