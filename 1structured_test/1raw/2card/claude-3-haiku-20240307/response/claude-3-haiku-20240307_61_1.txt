To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B are:

Posterior odds (A:B) = (P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where P(A|evidence) and P(B|evidence) are the conditional probabilities of the events A and B given the observed evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card).

To calculate these probabilities, we need to use the binomial distribution:

P(A|evidence) = (3/4)^3 * (1/4) * (2/3) / [(3/4)^3 * (1/4) * (2/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/3)]
P(B|evidence) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/3) / [(3/4)^3 * (1/4) * (2/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/3)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Posterior odds (A:B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
