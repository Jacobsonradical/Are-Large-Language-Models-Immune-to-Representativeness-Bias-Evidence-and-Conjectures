To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

We are given the following information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (the probability of drawing an X card from Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (the probability of drawing an O card from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (the probability of drawing an X card from Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (the probability of drawing an O card from Deck B)
- We observed 3 X cards and 1 O card drawn from one of the decks.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds can be calculated as:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the two decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81) / (8/81) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 1}
