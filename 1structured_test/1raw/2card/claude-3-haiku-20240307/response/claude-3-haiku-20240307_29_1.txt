To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A vs. B, given the observed outcome X.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27
P(A) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B)
P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
