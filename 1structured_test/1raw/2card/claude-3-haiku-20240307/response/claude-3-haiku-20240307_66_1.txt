To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

The posterior odds of A compared to B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of the cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of the cards being drawn from Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O
- P(A) is the prior probability of the cards being drawn from Deck A
- P(B) is the prior probability of the cards being drawn from Deck B

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Now, we need to calculate the probabilities P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Where:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27
P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B) = 8/27

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|X,O) = (8/27) * 0.5 / (8/27) = 0.5
P(B|X,O) = (8/27) * 0.5 / (8/27) = 0.5

The posterior odds of A compared to B is:
Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B)) = (0.5 / 0.5) * 1 = 1

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 1}
