To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The probability of selecting either deck is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Posterior odds:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (8/27 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2)
                = 27/8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 27/8}
