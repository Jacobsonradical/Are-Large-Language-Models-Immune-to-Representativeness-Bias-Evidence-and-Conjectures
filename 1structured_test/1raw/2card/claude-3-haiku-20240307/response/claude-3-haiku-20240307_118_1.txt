To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data of 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

The posterior odds is then:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

We can simplify this expression by noting that P(3X, 1O) is the same in both the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out.

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Now, let's calculate the individual probabilities:

P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 3 to 1.
