To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B are:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data))

Where:
- P(A|data) is the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data.
- P(B|data) is the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B, given the observed data.

To calculate these probabilities, we need to use the given information about the composition of the decks.

P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Simplifying the calculation, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 8}
