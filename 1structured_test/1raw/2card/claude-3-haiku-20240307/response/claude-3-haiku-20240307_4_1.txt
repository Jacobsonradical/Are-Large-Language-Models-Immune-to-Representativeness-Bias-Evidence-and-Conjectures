To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (the probability of drawing an X card from Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (the probability of drawing an O card from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (the probability of drawing an X card from Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (the probability of drawing an O card from Deck B)
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O), we can use the following formula:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (the decks are equally likely to be selected), we can simplify the calculation:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O))
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) / P(3X, 1O))

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))
            = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))
            = ((4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
            = (8 * (8/27) * (1/3)) / (8 * (1/27) * (2/3))
            = (8/27) / (2/27)
            = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
