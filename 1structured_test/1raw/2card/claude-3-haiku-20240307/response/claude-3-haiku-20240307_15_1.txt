To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked with X
- O: The card is marked with O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of the cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of the cards being drawn from Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.037037

Posterior odds = (0.148148 / 0.037037) * (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 2}
