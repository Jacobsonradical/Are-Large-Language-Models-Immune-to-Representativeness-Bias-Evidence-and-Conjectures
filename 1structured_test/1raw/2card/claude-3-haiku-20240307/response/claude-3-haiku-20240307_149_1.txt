To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

To calculate this, we need to find P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O).

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), we can simplify the calculations:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.037037

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) = (0.148148 / 0.037037) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
