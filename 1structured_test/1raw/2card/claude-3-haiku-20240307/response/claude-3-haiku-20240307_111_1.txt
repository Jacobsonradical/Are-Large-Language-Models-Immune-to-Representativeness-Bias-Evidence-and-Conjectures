To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the observed data X.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

We can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.148
- P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
- P(B) = 1/2

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.296 * 1/2) / (0.148 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 2}
