To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- P(A) = probability that Deck A was selected
- P(B) = probability that Deck B was selected
- P(3X, 1O | A) = probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck A was selected
- P(3X, 1O | B) = probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck B was selected

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

Since we don't have enough information to determine the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume that they are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = (8/81 * 0.5) / ((8/81 * 0.5) + (8/243 * 0.5)) = 81/89

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 81/89}
