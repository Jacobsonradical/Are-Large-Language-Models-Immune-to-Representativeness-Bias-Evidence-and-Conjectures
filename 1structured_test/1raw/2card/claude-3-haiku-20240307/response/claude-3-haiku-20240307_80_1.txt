To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck B)
- P(3X, 1O) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate this, we need to find P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (the decks are equally likely to be selected), the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

Using the given information, we can calculate:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074

Posterior odds = 0.148148 / 0.074074 = 2

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:

{odds: 2}
