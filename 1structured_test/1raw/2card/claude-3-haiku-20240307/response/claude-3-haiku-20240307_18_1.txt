To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the observed data X.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

where:
- P(X|A) is the probability of observing the data X given that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- P(A) is the prior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- P(X|B) is the probability of observing the data X given that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- P(B) is the prior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck B

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.037037

Substituting the values, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (0.148148 * 0.5) / (0.037037 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
