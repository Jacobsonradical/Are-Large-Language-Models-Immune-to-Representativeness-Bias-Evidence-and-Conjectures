To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B), we need to consider the composition of the two decks:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (8/27) / (4/81)
                = 54/16
                = 3.375

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 3.375}
