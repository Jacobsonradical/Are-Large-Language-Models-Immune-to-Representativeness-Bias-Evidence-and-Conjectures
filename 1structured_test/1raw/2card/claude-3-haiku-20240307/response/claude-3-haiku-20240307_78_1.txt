To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- P(A) = the probability that Deck A was selected
- P(B) = the probability that Deck B was selected
- P(3X, 1O | A) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- P(3X, 1O | B) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
= (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))
= (P(3X, 1O | A) * 1/2) / (P(3X, 1O | B) * 1/2)
= P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

To calculate the probabilities P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B), we can use the given information about the composition of the decks.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:
posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/81 / 2/81 = 4
