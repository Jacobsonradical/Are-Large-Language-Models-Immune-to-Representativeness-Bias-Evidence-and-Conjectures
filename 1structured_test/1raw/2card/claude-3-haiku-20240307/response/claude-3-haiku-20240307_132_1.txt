To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of the selected deck being Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O), given the observed data of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of the data given Deck A) / (Likelihood of the data given Deck B) × (Prior odds)

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, with 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of the data given Deck A.
Likelihood of 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 0.148148148

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of the data given Deck B.
Likelihood of 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 0.037037037

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds.
Since the decks are selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1.

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Likelihood of the data given Deck A) / (Likelihood of the data given Deck B) × (Prior odds)
Posterior odds = (0.148148148) / (0.037037037) × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
