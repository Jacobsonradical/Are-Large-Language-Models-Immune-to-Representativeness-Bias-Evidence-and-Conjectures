To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data))

Where:
- P(A|data) is the probability of drawing the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(B|data) is the probability of drawing the observed data given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

To calculate these probabilities, we can use the multinomial distribution:

P(A|data) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(B|data) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Simplifying the calculations, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data)
               = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
               = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8.
