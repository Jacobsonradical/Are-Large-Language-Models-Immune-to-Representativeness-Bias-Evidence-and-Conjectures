To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A versus B, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 3}
