To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

Posterior odds = (P(data|A) / P(data|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(data|A) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(data|B) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Since the decks are selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Substituting these values, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(data|A) / P(data|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))
             = (8/27) / (4/27) * 0.5 / 0.5
             = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
