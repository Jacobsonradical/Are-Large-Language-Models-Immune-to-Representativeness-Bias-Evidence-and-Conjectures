To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following probabilities:
P(A) = the probability that Deck A was selected
P(B) = the probability that Deck B was selected
P(X|A) = the probability of drawing 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card from Deck A
P(X|B) = the probability of drawing 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card from Deck B

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

To calculate the probabilities P(X|A) and P(X|B), we can use the given information about the composition of the decks:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 2}
