To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, and 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds, P(A|D)/P(B|D), where D represents the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Assuming that both decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), we need to find the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equations, we get:

P(A|D) = (8/27 * 1/2) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (4/27 * 1/2) / P(D)

The posterior odds are then given by:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
