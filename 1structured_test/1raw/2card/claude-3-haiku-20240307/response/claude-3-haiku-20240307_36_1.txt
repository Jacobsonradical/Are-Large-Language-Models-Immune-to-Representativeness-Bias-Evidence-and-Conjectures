To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed evidence of 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card were drawn

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X) / P(B|X)) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The 4 cards drawn consist of 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074
P(A) = 0.5 (since the decks were selected by chance)
P(B) = 0.5 (since the decks were selected by chance)

Plugging these values into the posterior odds formula:
Posterior odds = (0.296 * 0.5) / (0.074 * 0.5) = 4.0

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.0.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4.0}
