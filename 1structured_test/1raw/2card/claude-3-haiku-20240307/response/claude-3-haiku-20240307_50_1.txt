To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Odds(A|3X,1O) = Odds(A) * (P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B))

where Odds(A) = P(A) / P(B) is the prior odds.

Given the information in the problem:
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
- P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Odds(A|3X,1O) = Odds(A) * (0.148 / 0.074) = Odds(A) * 2

Expressing the answer in the requested format:

{odds: 2}
