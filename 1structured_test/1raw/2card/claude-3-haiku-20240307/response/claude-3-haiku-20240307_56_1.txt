To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Assuming equal prior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Therefore, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 27/4

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 27/4}
