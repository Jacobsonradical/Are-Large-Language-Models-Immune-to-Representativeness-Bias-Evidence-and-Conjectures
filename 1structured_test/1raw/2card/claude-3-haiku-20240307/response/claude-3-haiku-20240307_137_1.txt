To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, which is:
P(Deck A | 3 X, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X, 1 O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:
P(Deck A | 3 X, 1 O) = (P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / P(3 X, 1 O)
P(Deck B | 3 X, 1 O) = (P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)) / P(3 X, 1 O)

The posterior odds is then:
P(Deck A | 3 X, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X, 1 O) = (P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B))

Substituting the given probabilities:
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074
P(Deck A) = 1/2 (since the decks are selected by chance)
P(Deck B) = 1/2 (since the decks are selected by chance)

The posterior odds is then:
{odds: 2.0}
