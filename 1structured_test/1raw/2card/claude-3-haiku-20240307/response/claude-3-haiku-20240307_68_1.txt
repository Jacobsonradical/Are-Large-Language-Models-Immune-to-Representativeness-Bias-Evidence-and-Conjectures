To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

We want to calculate the posterior odds P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O), where 3X and 1O represent the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

The posterior odds are then:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Calculating the probabilities:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296296
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.148148
P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
P(B) = 1/2

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) = (0.296296 * 1/2) / (0.148148 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
