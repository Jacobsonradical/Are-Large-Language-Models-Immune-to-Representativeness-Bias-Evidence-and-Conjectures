To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, which is P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected initially, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

P(3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) = (8/27) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2) = 8/54 + 4/81 = 40/162

The posterior odds of A compared to B is:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 3}
