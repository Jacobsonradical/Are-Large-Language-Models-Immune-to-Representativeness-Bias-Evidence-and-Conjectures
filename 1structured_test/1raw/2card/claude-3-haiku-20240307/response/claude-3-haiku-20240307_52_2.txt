To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

To calculate the probabilities, we can use the multinomial distribution:

P(3X,1O|A) = (3/4)^3 * (1/4)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X,1O|B) = (3/4)^3 * (1/4)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Assuming the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, we can simplify the expression:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
                       = (P(3X,1O|A)) / (P(3X,1O|B))
                       = [(3/4)^3 * (1/4) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(3/4)^3 * (1/4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
                       = 2^6 = 64

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 64}
