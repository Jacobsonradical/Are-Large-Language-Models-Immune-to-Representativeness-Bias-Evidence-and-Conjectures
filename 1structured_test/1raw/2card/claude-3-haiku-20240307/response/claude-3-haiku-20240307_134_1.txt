To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck B)
- Observed data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are {odds: 3}.
