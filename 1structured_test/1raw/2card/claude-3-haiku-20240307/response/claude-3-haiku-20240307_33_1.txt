To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B), we need to consider the composition of the two decks:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.0741 * 1/2)
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
