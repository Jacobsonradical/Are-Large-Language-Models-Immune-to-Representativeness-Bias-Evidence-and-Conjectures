To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The posterior odds of A compared to B can be calculated as:

Odds(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(X,O|A) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(X,O|B) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Odds(A|X,O) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 27/8}
