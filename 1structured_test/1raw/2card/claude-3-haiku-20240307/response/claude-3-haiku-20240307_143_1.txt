To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

where:
- P(A) = 0.5 (assuming equal probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B)
- P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B)
- P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
- P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.1481

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.2963 * 0.5 + 0.1481 * 0.5) = 0.6666

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 2}
