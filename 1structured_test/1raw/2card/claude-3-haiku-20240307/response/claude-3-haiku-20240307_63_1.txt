To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

The posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively.

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

To calculate the conditional probabilities, we can use the multinomial distribution:

P(A|X,O) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(B|X,O) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))
             = ((4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
             = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 8}.
