To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

We are given the following information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3

We want to find the posterior odds, P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

The posterior odds are then:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

To calculate P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B), we can use the multinomial distribution:
P(3X,1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X,1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Assuming P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (the cards were selected by chance), the posterior odds become:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * 1/2) / (P(3X,1O|B) * 1/2)
                       = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)
                       = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                       = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 8}
