To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the selected deck being Deck A vs. Deck B, given the observed information about the drawn cards.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck B)
- P(3X, 1O) = the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from the selected deck

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)) = (2^3 * 1) / (1^3 * 2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
