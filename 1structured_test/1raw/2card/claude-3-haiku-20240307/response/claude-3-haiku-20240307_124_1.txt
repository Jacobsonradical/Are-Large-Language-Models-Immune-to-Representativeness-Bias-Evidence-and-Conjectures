To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O), where X and O represent the observed cards (3 X and 1 O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(X,O|A) and P(X,O|B), we can use the multinomial distribution:

P(X,O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(X,O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Canceling out the common factors, we get:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                    = (2/3)^2
                    = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
