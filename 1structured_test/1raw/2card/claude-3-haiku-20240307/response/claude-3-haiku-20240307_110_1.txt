To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards are drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards are drawn from Deck B.

We want to calculate the posterior odds of A compared to B, which is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B))
P(B|data) = (P(data|B) * P(B)) / (P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B))

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = P(data|A) / P(data|B)

To calculate P(data|A) and P(data|B), we need to consider the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.037037

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(data|A) / P(data|B) = 0.148148 / 0.037037 = 4

Rounding this to a single number, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
