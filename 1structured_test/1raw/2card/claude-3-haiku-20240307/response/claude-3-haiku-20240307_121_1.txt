To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The 4 cards drawn contain 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the individual probabilities:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we can simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B))

Now, we need to calculate P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B).

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
