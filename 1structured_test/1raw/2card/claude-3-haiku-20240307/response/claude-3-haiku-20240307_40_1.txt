To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

We can calculate the conditional probabilities as follows:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (8/27) / (4/27)
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
