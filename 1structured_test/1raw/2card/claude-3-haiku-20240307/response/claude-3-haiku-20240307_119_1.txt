To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.037037

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) = 0.0925925

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) = (0.148148 / 0.037037) = 4

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
