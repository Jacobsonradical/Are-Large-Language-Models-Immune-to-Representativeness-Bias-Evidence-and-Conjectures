To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the two decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probabilities:
- P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (8/27) / ((8/27) + (2/27)) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
