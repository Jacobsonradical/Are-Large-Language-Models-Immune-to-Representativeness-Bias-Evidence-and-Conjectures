To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the selected deck is Deck A
- B: the selected deck is Deck B
- X: a card is marked X
- O: a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 out of the 4 drawn cards are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

where P(A|X,O) is the probability that the selected deck is Deck A given the observed cards, and P(B|X,O) is the probability that the selected deck is Deck B given the observed cards.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B) = (8/27) * (1/2) + (8/27) * (1/2) = 8/27

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))
            = ((8/27) / (8/27)) / ((8/27) / (8/27))
            = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 1}.
