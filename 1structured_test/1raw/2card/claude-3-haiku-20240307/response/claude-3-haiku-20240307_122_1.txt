To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) = probability that Deck A was selected
- P(B) = probability that Deck B was selected
- P(3X, 1O | A) = probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that Deck A was selected
- P(3X, 1O | B) = probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that Deck B was selected

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of Deck A vs. Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A) * P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(B) * P(3X, 1O | B))

Assuming that the decks were selected with equal probability, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate the probabilities P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B), we can use the binomial distribution. In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.444444

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.148148

Plugging these values into the posterior odds formula, we get:

Posterior odds = (1/2 * 0.444444) / (1/2 * 0.148148) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 3}.
