To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, and 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to calculate the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of Deck A given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of Deck B given the observed data
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively (assumed to be equal)

Calculating the probabilities:

P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Since the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are assumed to be equal, the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))) = 3.0

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 3.0}
