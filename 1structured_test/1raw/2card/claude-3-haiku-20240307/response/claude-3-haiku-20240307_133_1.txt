To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(3X, 1O) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card in the drawn set

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))
               = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the given probabilities:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (8/81) = 81/27 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 3}.
