To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards drawn are marked X, and 1 card drawn is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O))

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming the prior probability of selecting Deck A and Deck B is equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
