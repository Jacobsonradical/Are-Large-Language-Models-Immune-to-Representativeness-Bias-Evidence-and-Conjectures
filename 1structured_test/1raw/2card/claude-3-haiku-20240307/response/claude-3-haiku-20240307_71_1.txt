To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|3X, 1O): The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O): The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
- P(A) / P(B): The prior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 8/81
- P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 8/243
- P(A) / P(B) = 1 (since the decks were selected by chance)

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (8/243) = 27/3 = 9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 9.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 9}
