To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296296
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074
- P(A) = 0.5 (since the decks were selected by chance)
- P(B) = 0.5

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X) / P(B|X)) = (P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)) / (P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X))
                = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (0.296296 * 0.5) / (0.074074 * 0.5)
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
