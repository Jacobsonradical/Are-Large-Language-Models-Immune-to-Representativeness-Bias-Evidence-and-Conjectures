To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X, 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

The posterior odds of A vs B is given by:
Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)

Let's calculate the necessary probabilities:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296296
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.148148

P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
P(B) = 1/2

P(X) = P(X|A)*P(A) + P(X|B)*P(B) = 0.222222

Posterior odds = (P(X|A)*P(A)) / (P(X|B)*P(B)) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is {odds: 2}.
