To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, which is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of A compared to B.
P(A) / P(B) = 1 (since the decks were selected by chance)

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds of A compared to B.
Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))
Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) * 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
