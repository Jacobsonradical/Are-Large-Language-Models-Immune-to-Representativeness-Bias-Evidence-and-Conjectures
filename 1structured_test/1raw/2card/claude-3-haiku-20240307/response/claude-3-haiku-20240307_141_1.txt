To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate P(X|A)
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Step 2: Calculate P(X|B)
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
Posterior odds = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 3}.
