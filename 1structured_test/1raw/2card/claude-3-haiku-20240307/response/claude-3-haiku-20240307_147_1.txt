To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B are:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Posterior odds = (0.148 / 0.074) * (0.5 / 0.5) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
