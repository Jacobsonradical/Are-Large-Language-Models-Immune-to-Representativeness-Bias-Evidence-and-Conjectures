To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: The card is marked X.
- O: The card is marked O.

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- The 4 cards drawn have 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We want to calculate the posterior odds of A over B, which is:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

The posterior odds are then:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we can simplify the expression:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B))

Calculating the probabilities:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 3}
