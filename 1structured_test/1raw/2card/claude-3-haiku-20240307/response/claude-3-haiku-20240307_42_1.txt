To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The event that a card is marked X
- O: The event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (the probability of a card being marked X in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (the probability of a card being marked O in Deck B)
- The outcome: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probabilities), we can simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B))

Calculating the probabilities:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 3.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 3}
