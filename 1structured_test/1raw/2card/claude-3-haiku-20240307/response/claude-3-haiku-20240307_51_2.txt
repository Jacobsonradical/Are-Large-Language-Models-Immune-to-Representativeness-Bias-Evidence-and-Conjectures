To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: a card is marked X
- O: a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A
- P(B|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), the posterior odds can be calculated as follows:

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Posterior odds = (0.148 / 0.074) * (0.5 / 0.5) = 2.0

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2.0}
