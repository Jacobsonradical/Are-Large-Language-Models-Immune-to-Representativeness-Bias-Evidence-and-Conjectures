To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.

The posterior odds of A compared to B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, we can simplify the expression to:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

To calculate the probabilities, we can use the binomial distribution formula:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1
P(B|3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))
             = ((4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1) / ((4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1)
             = (2^3 × (2/3)^2) / (2^3 × (1/3)^2)
             = (2/1) × (4/1) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8.
