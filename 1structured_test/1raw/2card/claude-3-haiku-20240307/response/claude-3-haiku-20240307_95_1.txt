To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B)
P(X,O) = (2/3 * 1/3 * 1/2) + (1/3 * 2/3 * 1/2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

P(A|X,O) = (2/3 * 1/3 * 1/2) / (1/3) = 2
P(B|X,O) = (1/3 * 2/3 * 1/2) / (1/3) = 1

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = 2 / 1 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
