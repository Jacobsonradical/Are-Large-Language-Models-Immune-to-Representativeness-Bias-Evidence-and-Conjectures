To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A vs. Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck B)
- The outcome observed is 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find the posterior odds of A vs. B, which is:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]
P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)] / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Therefore, the posterior odds of A vs. B are:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/81) / (8/81) = 1

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 1}
