To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, which is P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B) = (8/27 * 1/2) + (4/27 * 1/2) = 6/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
