To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the card is marked X
- O: the card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, 3 of which are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated as:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the two decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 3}
