To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B are:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(A|X,O) can be calculated as:
P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(B|X,O) can be calculated as:
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Substituting these values, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))
             = (8/27) / (4/27) * (1/2) / (1/2)
             = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 2}
