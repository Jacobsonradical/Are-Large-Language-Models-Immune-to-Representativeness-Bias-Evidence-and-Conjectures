To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Assuming P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since one of the decks is selected by chance),

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1.
