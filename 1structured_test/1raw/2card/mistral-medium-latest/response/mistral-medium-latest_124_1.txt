To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, deck A as A, and deck B as B.

First, let's find P(E|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards are from deck A:

P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

Using binomial probability formula for 4 trials with 3 successes (X's):

P(E|A) = C(4, 3) \* (P(X|A)^3) \* (P(O|A)^1)
        = (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* ((2/3)^3) \* ((1/3)^1)
        = 0.4444

Now, let's find P(E|B), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards are from deck B:

P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

Using binomial probability formula for 4 trials with 3 successes (X's):

P(E|B) = C(4, 3) \* (P(X|B)^3) \* (P(O|B)^1)
        = (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* ((1/3)^3) \* ((2/3)^1)
        = 0.0889

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(E|A) to P(E|B):

posterior odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B)
               = 0.4444 / 0.0889
               = 5

So, the posterior odds are 5 in favor of deck A.
