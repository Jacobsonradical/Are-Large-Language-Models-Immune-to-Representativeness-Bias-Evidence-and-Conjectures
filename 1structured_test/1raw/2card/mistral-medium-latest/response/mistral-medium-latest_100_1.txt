To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite the posterior odds as:
Posterior odds = [P(3X and 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)] / [P(3X and 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]

Assuming that the prior probability of selecting either deck is equal, i.e., P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5, we can simplify the equation:
Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1)

Posterior odds = 2^4 / 1^2

odds: 16
