To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of selecting Deck A as P(A) and the probability of selecting Deck B as P(B), which are both 0.5 since the choice is random.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Plugging in the values:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
Posterior odds = (2/3)^2

{odds: 4/9}

Note: The answer is given as a fraction instead of a single number because it represents the odds ratio. If you prefer to express it as a single number, you can do so by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 4/9 â‰ˆ 0.444. However, keeping it as a fraction makes it easier to interpret as odds.
