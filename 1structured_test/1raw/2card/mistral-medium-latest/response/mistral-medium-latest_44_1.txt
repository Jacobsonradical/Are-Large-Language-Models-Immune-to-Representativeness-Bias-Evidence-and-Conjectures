To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then calculate the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as H1, and the event of selecting Deck B as H2. We're looking for the posterior odds P(H1|E) / P(H2|E).

First, let's find the probabilities P(E|H1) and P(E|H2).

P(E|H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Since we picked a deck at random, the prior probabilities P(H1) and P(H2) are both 0.5.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / P(E)
P(H2|E) = P(E|H2) * P(H2) / P(E)

Since we want the odds, we don't need to find P(E). We can just calculate the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

odds = P(H1|E) / P(H2|E)

Since P(H1) and P(H2) are equal, this simplifies to:

odds = P(E|H1) / P(E|H2)

Plugging in our values:

odds = 8/81 / 2/81 = 8/2 = 4

So the answer is:

{odds: 4}
