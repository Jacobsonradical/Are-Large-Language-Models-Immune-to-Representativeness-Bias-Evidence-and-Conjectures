To solve this problem, we will calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as HA, and the event of selecting Deck B as HB. We want to find the posterior odds P(HA|E) / P(HB|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(HA|E) = P(E|HA) \* P(HA) / P(E)
P(HB|E) = P(E|HB) \* P(HB) / P(E)

Since we selected one of the decks by chance, P(HA) = P(HB) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(E|HA) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is also given by the binomial distribution:

P(E|HB) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(HA|E) / P(HB|E) = [P(E|HA) \* P(HA)] / [P(E|HB) \* P(HB)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

odds = [(C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) \* 0.5] / [(C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1) \* 0.5]
odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Calculating the final result:

odds = (2/3)^2 = 4/9

However, the question asks for the posterior odds in favor of Deck A, which is the reciprocal of the above result:

odds = 9/4

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 9/4}
