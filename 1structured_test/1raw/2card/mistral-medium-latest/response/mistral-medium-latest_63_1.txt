First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. However, since we're only interested in the odds and not the full probability, we can simplify the calculation by considering the ratio of the probabilities:

Odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

Since the decks are chosen randomly, their prior probabilities are equal. Therefore:

Odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
