Here's the reasoning behind this answer:

1. Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. There are C(N, 4) ways to draw 4 cards from a deck of size N. The number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O is C(2N/3, 3) \* C(N/3, 1) (assuming N is large enough). So the probability is [C(2N/3, 3) \* C(N/3, 1)] / C(N, 4).

2. Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is [C(N/3, 3) \* C(2N/3, 1)] / C(N, 4).

3. The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the ratio of these probabilities.

4. Calculating this ratio, we get: [C(2N/3, 3) \* C(N/3, 1)] / [C(N/3, 3) \* C(2N/3, 1)] = (2N/3)^3 / (N/3)^3 = 8^3 = 512 / 64 = 9/1.

5. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 9 to 1.
