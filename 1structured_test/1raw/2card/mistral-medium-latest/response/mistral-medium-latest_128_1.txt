To find the posterior odds, we'll first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks A and B. Then we'll divide the probability of drawing from deck A by the probability of drawing from deck B.

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
   - The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
   - We can use binomial coefficients to find the number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from 4 draws (C(4,3) = 4).
   - So, the probability is 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.5333

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
   - The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
   - The probability is 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0889

3. Posterior odds:
   - Posterior odds are calculated as the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from deck A and deck B.
   - So, the posterior odds are 0.5333 / 0.0889 ≈ 6.00

{odds: 6.00}
