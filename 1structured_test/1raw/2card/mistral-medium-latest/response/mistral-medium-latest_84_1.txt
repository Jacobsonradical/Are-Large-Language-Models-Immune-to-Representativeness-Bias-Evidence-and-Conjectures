{odds: 3.25}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
   - We need to find the probability of the sequence XXXO or XOXX or XXOX or OXXX.
   - Each sequence has a probability of (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.
   - Since there are 4 possible sequences, the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

2. Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
   - Similarly, the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

3. Now, let's find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
   - Odds are defined as the ratio of probabilities.
   - So, the odds in favor of Deck A are the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

4. Calculating the odds:
   - Odds = [4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
   - Simplifying, we get: Odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1^1 / 2^1) = 2^2 = 3.25

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3.25.
