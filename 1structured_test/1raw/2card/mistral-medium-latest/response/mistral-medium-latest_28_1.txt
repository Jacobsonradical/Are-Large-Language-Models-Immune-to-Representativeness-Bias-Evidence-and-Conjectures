{odds: 4}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and for O it's 1/3.
   - Using binomial probability, the chance of getting 3 X's in 4 draws is C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, which equals 0.4444.

2. Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and for O it's 2/3.
   - Using binomial probability again, the chance of getting 3 X's in 4 draws is C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1, which equals 0.0926.

3. Now, we find the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities we just calculated.
   - Odds of drawing from Deck A = Probability of drawing from Deck A / Probability of drawing from Deck B = 0.4444 / 0.0926 â‰ˆ 4.8

4. However, since the odds should be represented as a single number without a fraction part, we can say that the odds are approximately 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A.
   - So, {odds: 4} would be the answer.

Note: This answer assumes that the selection of the deck and the drawing of the cards are independent events.
