To solve this problem, we will calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as H1, and the event of selecting Deck B as H2. We want to find the posterior odds P(H1|E)/P(H2|E).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities of selecting each deck, assuming they are equally likely:
P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5

Next, we'll find the likelihoods of observing the event E given that Deck A or Deck B was chosen:

P(E|H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(E|H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.008

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) \* P(H1) / P(E)
P(H2|E) = P(E|H2) \* P(H2) / P(E)

Since we're only interested in the ratio of the posterior probabilities, we can ignore the common denominator P(E):

odds = P(H1|E) / P(H2|E) = [P(E|H1) \* P(H1)] / [P(E|H2) \* P(H2)]

Plugging in the values:
odds ≈ (0.093 \* 0.5) / (0.008 \* 0.5)
odds ≈ 64.375 / 4
odds ≈ 16.09

{odds: 16.09}
