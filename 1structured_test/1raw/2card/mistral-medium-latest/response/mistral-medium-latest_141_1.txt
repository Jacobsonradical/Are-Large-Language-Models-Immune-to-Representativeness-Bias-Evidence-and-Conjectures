To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of drawing from deck A as P(A) and from deck B as P(B).

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds of drawing from deck A vs. deck B can be found by taking the ratio of the two probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of drawing from deck A.

Hence, the output format is:

{odds: 4}
