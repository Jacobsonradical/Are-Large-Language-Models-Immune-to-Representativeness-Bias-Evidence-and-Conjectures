To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as HA, and the event of selecting Deck B as HB. We want to find the posterior odds P(HA|E) / P(HB|E).

By Bayes' theorem:

P(HA|E) = P(E|HA) * P(HA) / P(E)
P(HB|E) = P(E|HB) * P(HB) / P(E)

Since we're assuming that the deck selection is random and fair, P(HA) = P(HB) = 0.5. Also, since the events of drawing cards from different decks are mutually exclusive, P(E) can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of drawing the cards from each deck: P(E) = P(E|HA) \* P(HA) + P(E|HB) \* P(HB). However, since P(HA) and P(HB) are equal, we can simplify the expression for the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)]

Now, let's calculate P(E|HA) and P(E|HB):

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using binomial coefficients:

P(E|HA) = (4 choose 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
P(E|HA) = (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* (8/27) \* (1/3)
P(E|HA) = 4/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(E|HB) = (4 choose 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1
P(E|HB) = (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* (1/27) \* (2/3)
P(E|HB) = 8/243

So, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = [P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)] = (4/27) / (8/243) = 32/32 = 1

However, the question asks for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, so we should account for the fact that both decks are equally likely a priori:

Posterior odds = [P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)] \* [P(HA) / P(HB)] = (4/27) / (8/243) \* 1 = 243/216 \* 1 = 3/2

Thus, the posterior odds are 3:2 in favor of Deck A.
