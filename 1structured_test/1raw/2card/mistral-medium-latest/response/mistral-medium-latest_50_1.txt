To solve this problem, we will calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks A and B, and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote:
P(A) = Prior probability of choosing deck A = 0.5 (since it's chosen by chance)
P(B) = Prior probability of choosing deck B = 0.5
P(X) = Probability of drawing an X card
P(O) = Probability of drawing an O card

First, let's find the likelihood of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from deck A:

Likelihood of drawing from deck A (LA) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
LA = 0.09302326

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from deck B:

Likelihood of drawing from deck B (LB) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
LB = 0.00972222

Now, we can find the posterior odds by using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|observation) / P(B|observation) = [P(observation|A) \* P(A)] / [P(observation|B) \* P(B)]

Since we are looking for the odds in favor of deck A, we can simplify this expression to:

Posterior odds = [Likelihood of drawing from deck A] / [Likelihood of drawing from deck B]

Posterior odds = LA / LB = 0.09302326 / 0.00972222 â‰ˆ 9.567

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from deck A compared to deck B are approximately 9.567.

{odds: 9.567}
