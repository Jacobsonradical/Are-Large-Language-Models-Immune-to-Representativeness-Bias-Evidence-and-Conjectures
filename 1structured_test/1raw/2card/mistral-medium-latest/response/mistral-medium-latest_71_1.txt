{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
   - Using binomial probability formula, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws is: (4 C 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
     - (4 C 3) = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
     - The probability = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

2. Let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws is: (4 C 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
     - The probability = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

3. To find the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of these events happening in Deck A and Deck B.
   - Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)
   - Posterior odds = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]
   - Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal (e.g., 0.5) and cancel them out.
   - Posterior odds = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)
   - Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 9

So the posterior odds are 9 in favor of drawing the cards from Deck A.
