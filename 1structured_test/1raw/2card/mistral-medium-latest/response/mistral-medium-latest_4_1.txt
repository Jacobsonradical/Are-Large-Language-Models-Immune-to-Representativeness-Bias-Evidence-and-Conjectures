To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A, which is equal to P(B), the prior probability of selecting Deck B, since the selection is by chance. Therefore, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4! / (3! * 1!))
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4! / (3! * 1!))

The factorial term accounts for the number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 draws.

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities multiplied by their respective prior probabilities:

Posterior odds = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(A)] / [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(B)]
Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Calculating the expression above:

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1)
Posterior odds = 8 / (1/2)
Posterior odds = 16

Thus, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are 16.
