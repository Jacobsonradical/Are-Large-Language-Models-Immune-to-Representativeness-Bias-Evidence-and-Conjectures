To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then take their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:
odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
