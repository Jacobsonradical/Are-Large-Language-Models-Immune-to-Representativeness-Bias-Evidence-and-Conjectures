To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of those probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The prior odds of choosing either deck are equal since it is a chance selection, so they are 1:1 or simply 1.

To find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = 1 * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2

So the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
