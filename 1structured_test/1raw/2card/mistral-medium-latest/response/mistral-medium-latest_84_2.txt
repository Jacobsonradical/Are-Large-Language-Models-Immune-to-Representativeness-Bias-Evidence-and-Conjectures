To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, the posterior odds are calculated as the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Calculating the ratio:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
Posterior odds = (2/3)^2

Hence, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: (2/3)^2}

Or, if you prefer a decimal approximation:

{odds: 0.44444444444}
