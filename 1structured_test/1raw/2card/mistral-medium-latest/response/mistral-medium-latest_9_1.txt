To find the posterior odds, we will first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Let's denote the probability of selecting deck A as P(A) and the probability of selecting deck B as P(B). Since the decks are chosen by chance, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let X3O1 represent the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:
P(X3O1|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:
P(X3O1|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A and deck B:
posterior odds = P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify this expression by canceling out the prior probabilities:
posterior odds = P(X3O1|A) / P(X3O1|B)

Plugging in the values, we get:
posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 4}
