To find the posterior odds, we'll first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then, we'll take the ratio of these likelihoods to determine the posterior odds.

1. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

2. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

3. Prior odds (assuming equal probability of choosing either deck):
Odds(Deck A) = 1 : 1 or simply 1

4. Posterior odds:
Odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1^1 / 2^1) / (1^3 / 2^3) * (2^1 / 1^1)

Posterior odds = 2^3 * (1/2) / (1/2^3)

Posterior odds = 8 / (1/8)

Posterior odds = 8 * 8

Posterior odds = 64

{odds: 64}
