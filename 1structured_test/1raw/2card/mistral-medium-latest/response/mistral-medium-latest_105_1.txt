To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, then take the ratio of those probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we'll take the ratio of these probabilities to find the posterior odds:
posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Calculating the ratio:
odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1^1 / 2^1)
odds = 8 / 2
odds = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.

{odds: 4}
