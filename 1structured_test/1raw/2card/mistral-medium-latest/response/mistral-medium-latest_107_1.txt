To find the posterior odds, we'll first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Let's denote P(A) and P(B) as the probabilities of selecting decks A and B respectively. Since they are chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now let's find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A and deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds are 4 in favor of deck A.
