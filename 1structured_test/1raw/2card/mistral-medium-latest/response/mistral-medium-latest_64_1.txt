{odds: 3.0}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. This is a hypergeometric distribution problem, as we're drawing without replacement.
   - The probability of drawing an X first is 2/3.
   - The probability of drawing an X second, given that the first card was an X, is (2/3 - 1)/(total cards in deck A - 1), which simplifies to 1/2 (assuming the total number of cards in the deck is much larger than 4).
   - The probability of drawing an X third, given that the first two cards were X's, is (1/2 - 1)/(total cards in deck A - 2), which simplifies to 1/3.
   - The probability of drawing an O fourth, given that the first three cards were X's, is 1/3 (since there's now an equal number of X's and O's left in the deck after removing 3 cards).
   - Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3) \* (1/2) \* (1/3) \* (1/3) = 1/27.
2. Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - The probability of drawing an X first is 1/3.
   - The probability of drawing an X second, given that the first card was an X, is (1/3 - 1)/(total cards in deck B - 1), which simplifies to 1/4 (assuming the total number of cards in the deck is much larger than 4).
   - The probability of drawing an X third, given that the first two cards were X's, is (1/4 - 1)/(total cards in deck B - 2), which simplifies to 1/5.
   - The probability of drawing an O fourth, given that the first three cards were X's, is 2/5 (since there are now twice as many O's as X's left in the deck after removing 3 cards).
   - Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3) \* (1/4) \* (1/5) \* (2/5) = 1/150.
3. Finally, to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we can divide the probabilities we just calculated: 1/27 divided by 1/150, which equals 3/2 or 1.5 (rounded down). However, since we want the odds in favor of Deck A, we need to account for the initial 50/50 chance of selecting either deck: 1.5 \* 2 = 3.0.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 3.0.
