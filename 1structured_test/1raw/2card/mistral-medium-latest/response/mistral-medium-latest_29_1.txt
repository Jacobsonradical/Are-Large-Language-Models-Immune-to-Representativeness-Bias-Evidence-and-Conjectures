To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

1. First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

3. Now, the prior odds of drawing from Deck A or Deck B are equal, since there is no information given about the likelihood of selecting one deck over the other. So the prior odds ratio is 1.

4. The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds ratio by the likelihood ratio (the ratio of the probabilities calculated in steps 1 and 2):
Posterior odds = Prior odds * (Likelihood for Deck A / Likelihood for Deck B)
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81 / 2/81) = 1 * (8/2) = 4

{odds: 4}
