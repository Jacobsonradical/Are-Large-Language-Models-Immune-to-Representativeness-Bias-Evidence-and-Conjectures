ToCalculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing an X: P(X) = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: P(O) = 1/3
   - Using binomial distribution, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
     - P(3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.395

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing an X: P(X) = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: P(O) = 2/3
   - Using binomial distribution, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
     - P(3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.093

The prior odds are equal since the deck was chosen by chance, so they are 1:1 or simply 1.

The posterior odds (in favor of Deck A) are calculated as the ratio of the two probabilities:

- Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O from Deck A) / P(3X, 1O from Deck B) ≈ 0.395 / 0.093 ≈ 4.247

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 4.247:
