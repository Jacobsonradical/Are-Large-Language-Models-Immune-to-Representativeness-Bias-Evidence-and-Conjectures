{odds: 4}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
2. The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.
4. Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
5. The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
6. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.
7. The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A vs. Deck B are the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.
8. Therefore, the posterior odds are (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

Hence, the odds are 4 in favor of Deck A.
