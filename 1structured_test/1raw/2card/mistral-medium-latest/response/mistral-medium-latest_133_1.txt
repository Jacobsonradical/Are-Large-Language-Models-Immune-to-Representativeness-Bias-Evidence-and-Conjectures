{odds: 4}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's denote the probability of selecting Deck A as P(A) and the probability of selecting Deck B as P(B). Since the selection is by chance, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
2. To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and update our prior probabilities (P(A) and P(B)) accordingly.
3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using binomial probability: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.0972.
4. Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0088.
5. Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by finding the ratio of the likelihood of the event occurring in Deck A to that of Deck B: 0.0972 / 0.0088 ≈ 11.045.
6. However, since we are only interested in the odds of Deck A compared to Deck B, we can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the probability of the event occurring in Deck B: 11.045 / 0.0088 ≈ 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 4.
