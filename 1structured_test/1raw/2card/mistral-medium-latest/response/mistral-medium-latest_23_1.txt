To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, and the event of selecting deck A as H\_A, and deck B as H\_B. We want to find the posterior odds P(H\_A|E)/P(H\_B|E).

First, we find P(E|H\_A) and P(E|H\_B):

P(E|H\_A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|H\_B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Since we selected one of the decks at random, let's assume that P(H\_A) = P(H\_B) = 0.5. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(H\_A|E) = P(E|H\_A) \* P(H\_A) / P(E)
P(H\_B|E) = P(E|H\_B) \* P(H\_B) / P(E)

We don't need to find P(E) explicitly since it will cancel out in the odds ratio:

Posterior odds = P(H\_A|E) / P(H\_B|E) = [P(E|H\_A) \* P(H\_A)] / [P(E|H\_B) \* P(H\_B)]

Since P(H\_A) = P(H\_B), the denominators cancel out, and we only need to consider the likelihoods:

Posterior odds = P(E|H\_A) / P(E|H\_B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from deck A are 4 to 1 compared to deck B.
