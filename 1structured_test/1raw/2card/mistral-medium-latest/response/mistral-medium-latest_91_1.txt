{odds: 32/3}

Here's the reasoning behind this answer:

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A.
The probability of drawing an X from deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
So the probability of drawing this particular sequence of cards is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

However, since the order doesn't matter, there are actually "4 choose 3" = 4 possible ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards.
So the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:
4 * (8/81) = 32/81

Similarly, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B.
The probability of drawing an X from deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
So the probability of drawing this particular sequence of cards is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Again, there are 4 possible ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards, so the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:
4 * (2/81) = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A, given that 3 are X's and 1 is O:

odds = (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A) / (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)
odds = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/3

So the posterior odds are 32:3 in favor of deck A.
