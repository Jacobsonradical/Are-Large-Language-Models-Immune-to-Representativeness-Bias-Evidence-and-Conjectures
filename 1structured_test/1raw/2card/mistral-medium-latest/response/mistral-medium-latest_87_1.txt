To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then calculate the odds using those probabilities.

Let's denote the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B as P(A) and P(B), respectively.

First, let's find P(A):
There are C(n, k) ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to order, where C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]. In this case, there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose 3 X's from the 4 drawn cards.

The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. Since we're considering 4 cards, there are 3 draws of X and 1 draw of O. So,

P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4

Now let's find P(B):
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. Following the same reasoning as before:

P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of P(A) to P(B):

odds = P(A) / P(B)

Calculating the odds:
odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4)
odds = (2/3)^2
odds â‰ˆ 4/9

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4/9}
