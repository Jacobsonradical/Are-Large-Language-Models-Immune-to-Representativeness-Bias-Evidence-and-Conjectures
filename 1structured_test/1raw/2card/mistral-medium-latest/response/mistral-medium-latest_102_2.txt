To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a specific configuration from deck A as P(A), and from deck B as P(B). We want to find the odds P(A) / P(B).

First, let's find P(A):
P(3 X's and 1 O in deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find P(B):
P(3 X's and 1 O in deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
