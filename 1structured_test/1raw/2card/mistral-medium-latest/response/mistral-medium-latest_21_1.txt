To find the posterior odds, we'll first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then, we'll use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on this new information. Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds are 1:1.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. The formula for posterior odds is:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds = 4 * 1 = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
