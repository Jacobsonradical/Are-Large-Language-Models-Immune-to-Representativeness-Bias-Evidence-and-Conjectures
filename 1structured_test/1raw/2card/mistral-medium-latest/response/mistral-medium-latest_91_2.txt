To answer this question, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the posterior odds).

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A (or Deck B), which is 0.5 for both since one of the decks has been chosen by chance.
P(3X and 1O | A) as the conditional probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
P(3X and 1O | B) as the conditional probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O). By using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | A) \* P(A) / [P(3X and 1O | A) \* P(A) + P(3X and 1O | B) \* P(B)]

And similarly for P(B | 3X and 1O). Since P(A) = P(B), this simplifies to:

Odds = [P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)]

Now let's calculate the probabilities P(3X and 1O | A) and P(3X and 1O | B):

- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

Odds = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]
Odds = (2^3 / 1^3) \* (1^1 / 2^1)
Odds = 8/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A instead of Deck B is 8.

{odds: 8}
