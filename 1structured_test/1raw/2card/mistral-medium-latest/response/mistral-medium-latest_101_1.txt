{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.
2. For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
   - Probability of drawing an X: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: 1/3
   - Using binomial probability formula (C(n, k) \* p^k \* q^(n-k)):
     - P(3 X's and 1 O) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.4444
3. For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
   - Probability of drawing an X: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: 2/3
   - P(3 X's and 1 O) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0694
4. Now let's find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A vs. Deck B:
   - Odds = (P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B))
   - Odds = 0.4444 / 0.0694 ≈ 6.4035
5. Simplifying the odds to the nearest whole number, we get:
   - Odds = 9

So, the posterior odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B is 9.
