To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of those probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^1) * (1^1 / 2^1)
Posterior odds = 8/2
Posterior odds = 4

So the final answer is:
{odds: 4}
