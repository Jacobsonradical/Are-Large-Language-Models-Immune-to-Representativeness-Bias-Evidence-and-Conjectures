To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the prior probabilities and likelihoods for each deck.

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since either deck could be chosen)

Likelihoods:
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.008

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]
P(A | 3X and 1O) ≈ 0.093 * 0.5 / (0.093 * 0.5 + 0.008 * 0.5) ≈ 0.92

Similarly,
P(B | 3X and 1O) ≈ 0.08

Now we find the posterior odds by dividing the posterior probability of deck A by the posterior probability of deck B:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O) ≈ 0.92 / 0.08 ≈ 11.5

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is about 11.5.

{odds: 11.5}
