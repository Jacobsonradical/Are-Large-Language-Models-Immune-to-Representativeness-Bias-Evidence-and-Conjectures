To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities. Since we don't have specific prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, we'll assume they are equal (e.g., 1/2 for each deck).

Posterior odds = (Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio)

Since the prior probabilities are equal, the prior odds are 1. The likelihood ratio is the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.

Likelihood ratio = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds (1) and the likelihood ratio (4).

odds: 4
