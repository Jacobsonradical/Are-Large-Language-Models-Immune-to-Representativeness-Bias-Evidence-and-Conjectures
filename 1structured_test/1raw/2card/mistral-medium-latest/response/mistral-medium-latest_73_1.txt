First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of the observed data given each deck:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Since the decks were selected by chance, we can assume equal prior odds for both decks. Therefore, the initial odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
