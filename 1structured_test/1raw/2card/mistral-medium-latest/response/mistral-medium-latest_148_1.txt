To answer this question, we need to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of the two events given the observed data. The observed data is that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 4! / (3! \* 1!)
= 0.2963

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 4! / (3! \* 1!)
= 0.0135

Now, let's calculate the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting each deck before any cards are drawn. Since the selection of the deck is by chance, we assume equal probabilities for each deck. Therefore, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the ratio of the probabilities of the observed data given each deck:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* (P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B))
= 1 \* (0.2963 / 0.0135)
= 21.96

{odds: 21.96}
