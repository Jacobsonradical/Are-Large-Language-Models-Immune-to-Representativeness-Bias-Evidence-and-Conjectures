To answer this question, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities. Let's calculate:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now let's find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities:
odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
