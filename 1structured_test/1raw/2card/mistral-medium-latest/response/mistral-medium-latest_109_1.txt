To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing this combination from deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing this combination from deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Plugging in the values:

odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)
odds = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1)
odds = 8 / (1/2)
odds = 16

So the posterior odds are 16:
{odds: 16}
