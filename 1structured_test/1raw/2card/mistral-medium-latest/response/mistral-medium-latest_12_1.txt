{odds: 3.6}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A.
   - P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.0972

2. Next, find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B.
   - P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0088

3. Now calculate the posterior odds (odds that the cards came from deck A vs. deck B).
   - Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
   - Since we chose a deck at random, the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal (0.5).
   - Posterior odds = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) \* 0.5] / [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) \* 0.5]
   - Posterior odds = 0.0972 / 0.0088 = 3.6

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A is 3.6.
