To answer this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let H\_A represent the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and H\_B represent the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let D represent the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H\_A|D) = [P(D|H\_A) \* P(H\_A)] / P(D)

And similarly for Deck B:

P(H\_B|D) = [P(D|H\_B) \* P(H\_B)] / P(D)

Since we are only interested in the odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B, we can ignore the denominator P(D), as it is the same for both calculations. We can also assume that P(H\_A) = P(H\_B) = 0.5, as there is no prior reason to favor one deck over the other.

Now, we need to calculate the likelihoods P(D|H\_A) and P(D|H\_B).

For Deck A:
P(D|H\_A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(D|H\_B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(H\_A|D) / P(H\_B|D) = [P(D|H\_A) \* P(H\_A)] / [P(D|H\_B) \* P(H\_B)]

Since P(H\_A) = P(H\_B) = 0.5, the equation simplifies to:

odds = P(D|H\_A) / P(D|H\_B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds in favor of drawing from Deck A are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
