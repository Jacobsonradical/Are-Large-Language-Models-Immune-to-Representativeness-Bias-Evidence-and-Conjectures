To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds are given by the ratio of these probabilities:
Odds(A|E) = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
