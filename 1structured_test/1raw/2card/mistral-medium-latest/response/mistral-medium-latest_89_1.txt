To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing this combination from each deck:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A):
- Probability of drawing an X: 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O: 1/3

Using binomial probability formula: P(x successes in n trials) = C(n, x) \* p^x \* (1-p)^(n-x)

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.413

P(3X and 1O | Deck B):
- Probability of drawing an X: 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O: 2/3

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.088

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio)

Assuming equal prior odds for both decks (since no information about their relative sizes was given):

Prior odds = 1

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of 3X and 1O in Deck A / Likelihood of 3X and 1O in Deck B

Likelihood ratio = 0.413 / 0.088 ≈ 4.693

Posterior odds = 1 \* 4.693 ≈ 4.693

{odds: 4.693}
