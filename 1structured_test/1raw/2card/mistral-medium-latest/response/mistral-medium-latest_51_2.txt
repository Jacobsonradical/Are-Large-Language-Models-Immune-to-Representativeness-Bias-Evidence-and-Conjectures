To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A given the observed data. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the cards were drawn from Deck A," and event B is "3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O."

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from each deck, assuming both decks are equally likely:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Next, we need to find the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, P(B|A):

Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(B|A) = C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
          = 4 \* (8/27) \* (1/3)
          = 32/81

Similarly, we need to find the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, P(B|B^c):

P(B|B^c) = C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1
              = 4 \* (1/27) \* (2/3)
              = 8/81

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities of drawing from Deck A given the observed data:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|B^c) \* P(B^c)]

Since P(A) = P(B^c) = 0.5, we have:

P(A|B) = (32/81 \* 0.5) / [(32/81 \* 0.5) + (8/81 \* 0.5)]
           = 16/24
           = 2/3

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data are:

odds = P(A|B) / [1 - P(A|B)]
         = (2/3) / (1/3)
         = 2

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 2}
