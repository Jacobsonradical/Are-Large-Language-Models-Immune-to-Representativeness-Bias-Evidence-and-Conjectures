First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)
= (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* ((2/3)^3) \* (1/3)
= 4/3 \* 8/27 \* 1/3
= 32/243

Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)
= (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* ((1/3)^3) \* (2/3)
= 4/3 \* 1/27 \* 2/3
= 8/243

Now, let's find the posterior odds.

Posterior odds = (Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio)

Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds are equal (1:1). Therefore, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio
= P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)
= 32/243 / 8/243
= 32/8
= 4

{odds: 4}
