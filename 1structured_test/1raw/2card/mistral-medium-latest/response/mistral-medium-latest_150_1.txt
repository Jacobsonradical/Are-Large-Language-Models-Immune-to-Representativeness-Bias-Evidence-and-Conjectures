To find the posterior odds, we will first determine the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(3X,1O|A) and from Deck B as P(3X,1O|B).

For Deck A:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Since the decks are chosen by chance, the prior odds are equal (1:1). Now we will calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds
Likelihood ratio = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1 = 4

So the answer is:
{odds: 4}
