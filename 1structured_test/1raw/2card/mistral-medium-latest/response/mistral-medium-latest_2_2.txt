To solve this problem, we need to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A versus deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4C3
                         = (8/27) * (4!/3!1!)
                         = 32/81

Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4C3
                         = (1/27) * (4!/3!1!)
                         = 4/81

Now, let's find the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)
               = (32/81) / (4/81)
               = 32/4
               = 8

{odds: 8}
