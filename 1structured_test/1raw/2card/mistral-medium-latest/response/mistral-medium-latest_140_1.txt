To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

After calculating, we get:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                      = (2/1)^3
                      = 8

{odds: 8}
