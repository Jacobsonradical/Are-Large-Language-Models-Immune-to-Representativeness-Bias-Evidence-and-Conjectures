To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from deck A compared to deck B. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, we want to find the odds of drawing from deck A (event A) given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O (event B). The odds are defined as the ratio of the probabilities of each event:

Odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(B|not A)

Since only two decks are involved, the probability of not drawing from deck A is equal to the probability of drawing from deck B. So, P(B|not A) = P(drawing from deck B).

We are given that one of the decks has been selected by chance, so the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Now let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

- Deck A: P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
- Deck B: P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Odds(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B|not A) = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) \* P(A)] / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Plugging in the values:

Odds(A|B) = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]

Odds(A|B) = (2^3 / 1^3) \* (1^1 / 2^1) \* (0.5 / 1) = 8/3

So the answer is:

{odds: 8/3}
