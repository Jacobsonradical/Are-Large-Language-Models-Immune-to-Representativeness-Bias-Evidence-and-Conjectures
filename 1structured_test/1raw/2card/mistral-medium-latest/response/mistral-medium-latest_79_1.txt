To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods to determine the posterior odds.

Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.0444

Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0044

Now let's find the ratio of these likelihoods to determine the posterior odds:

Odds = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B
Odds = 0.0444 / 0.0044
Odds = 10

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is 10:1.

{odds: 10}
