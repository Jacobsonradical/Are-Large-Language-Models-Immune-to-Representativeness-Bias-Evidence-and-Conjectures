To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of those probabilities.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck A) = C(4,3) * (P(X))^3 * (P(O))^1
                         = 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                         = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck B) = C(4,3) * (P(X))^3 * (P(O))^1
                         = 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                         = 8/81

Now, the posterior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck B)
               = (32/81) / (8/81)
               = 32/8

So, the posterior odds are 32:8 in favor of Deck A.
