To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately and then take their ratio. Let's denote the events:

A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
X3O1: The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X3O1)/P(B|X3O1). Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

P(A|X3O1)/P(B|X3O1) = [P(X3O1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X3O1|B) \* P(B)]

Since we're assuming that one of the decks has been selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, we need to find P(X3O1|A) and P(X3O1|B).

For Deck A:
P(X3O1|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X3O1|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(X3O1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X3O1|B) \* P(B)] = (8/81 \* 0.5) / (2/81 \* 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.
