To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and from Deck B, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

{odds: 4}
