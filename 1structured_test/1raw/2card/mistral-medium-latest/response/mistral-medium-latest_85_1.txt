To find the posterior odds, we'll first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = P(XXXO) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)

Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = P(XXXO) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = (P(Deck A | XXXO)) / (P(Deck B | XXXO)) = [P(XXXO | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)] / [P(XXXO | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5.
The posterior odds are then the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

odds = P(XXXO | Deck A) / P(XXXO | Deck B) = [(4!/(3!1!)) \* ((2/3)^3) \* (1/3)] / [(4!/(3!1!)) \* ((1/3)^3) \* (2/3)]
odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3))
odds = (2^3) / (1^3) = 8

Thus, the posterior odds are 8:
{odds: 8}
