{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. The event we're interested in is drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck.

1. First, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X and 1/3 are O, this probability is:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Next, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X and 2/3 are O, this probability is:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

3. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. The prior odds of selecting Deck A vs. Deck B are 1:1 since there's no information given that would favor one deck over the other. So, the prior odds can be represented as P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1.

4. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds can be calculated as:
   Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
   Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4
   Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4/1

5. Since the posterior odds are typically expressed as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring, we can write the odds as:
   Odds = 4 / (1 - 4/1) = 4 / 1/1 = 9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 9.
