To solve this problem, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing from deck A as P(A) and from deck B as P(B). Since we randomly choose one of the two decks, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, P(3X and 1O | A):

There are 4 choices for the O card and C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose the 3 X cards from the 4 drawn cards. So, we have:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) / C(52,4)

Similarly, for deck B:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) / C(52,4)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite the equation:

Posterior odds = [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify the equation:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Calculating the ratio of the probabilities:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

The final answer is:

odds: 8
