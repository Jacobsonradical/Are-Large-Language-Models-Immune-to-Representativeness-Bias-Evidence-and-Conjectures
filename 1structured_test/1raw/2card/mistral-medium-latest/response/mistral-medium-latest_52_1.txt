{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: P(X|A) = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: P(O|A) = 1/3
   - Using binomial probability formula: C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 4 \* 8/27 \* 1/3 = 32/81

2. Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: P(X|B) = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: P(O|B) = 2/3
   - Using binomial probability formula: C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 4 \* 1/27 \* 2/3 = 8/81

3. Now, we'll find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
   - Odds are calculated as the ratio of the probabilities: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
   - However, since we're only interested in the odds and not the actual probabilities, we can use the calculated probabilities from steps 1 and 2: 32/81 / 8/81 = 32/8 = 9/2

4. Therefore, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A are 9:1 or simply 9.
