To answer this question, we'll calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, then find their ratio to obtain the posterior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we'll find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities.

posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.

{odds: 4}
