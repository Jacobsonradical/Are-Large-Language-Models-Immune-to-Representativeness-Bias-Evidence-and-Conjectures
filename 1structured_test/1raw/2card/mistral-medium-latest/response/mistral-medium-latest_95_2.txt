To solve this question, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|X) = [P(X|A) \* P(A)] / P(X)

where:

* P(A|X) is the posterior probability of event A given evidence X
* P(X|A) is the likelihood of observing evidence X given that event A occurred
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A
* P(X) is the marginal likelihood of observing evidence X

In this case, event A is "drawing from Deck A" and event B is "drawing from Deck B". The evidence X is "drawing 3 X's and 1 O". Since we are asked to find the posterior odds, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

Odds(A|X) = [P(X|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X|B) \* P(B)]

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the choice of deck is random. Therefore, we can set P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we need to calculate the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B). Since the draws are independent, we can calculate the likelihoods as the product of the probabilities of drawing each card in the observed sequence.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. Therefore, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, for Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. Therefore, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now we can plug these values into the formula for the posterior odds:

Odds(A|X) = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 0.5]

Simplifying, we get:

Odds(A|X) = (2/3)^4 / (1/3)^4

Odds(A|X) = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data are 16 to 1.
