To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Let's denote the events:
A: drawing from deck A
B: drawing from deck B
X3O1: drawing 3 X's and 1 O

First, find P(X3O1|A) and P(X3O1|B).

P(X3O1|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(X3O1|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since there is no information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we assume both decks have an equal chance of being selected. So, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the product of the likelihood and prior probabilities for each deck:

posterior odds = [P(X3O1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X3O1|B) \* P(B)]

Plug in the values:

posterior odds = (8/81 \* 1/2) / (2/81 \* 1/2)

Simplify:

posterior odds = 8 / 2

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 4}
