To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the posterior odds).

First, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Let's calculate the value:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
                      = (2^3 / 3^3) * (1 / 2^1) * (3^3 / 1^3) / (1 / 2^1)
                      = (2^2 / 3^2)
                      â‰ˆ 1.3333333

{odds: 1.3333333}
