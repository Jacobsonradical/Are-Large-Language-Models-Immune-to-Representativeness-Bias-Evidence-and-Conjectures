To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data. Let's denote events:

A: The deck is Deck A
B: The deck is Deck B
X: Drawing a card marked X
O: Drawing a card marked O

We want to find P(A|XXXO), which is the probability of drawing from Deck A given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)

We can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the posterior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior Odds = P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can simplify the equation to:

Posterior Odds = P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Finally, we can determine the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
