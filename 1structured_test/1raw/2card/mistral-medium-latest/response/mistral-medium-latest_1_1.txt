To answer this question, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A compared to deck B. The formula for posterior odds is:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio

Since we don't have any prior information about the probability of selecting either deck, we can assume equal prior probabilities, making the prior odds 1.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 8/81 ≈ 0.0988

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 2/81 ≈ 0.0247

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0988 / 0.0247 ≈ 3.996

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 3.996 ≈ 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A is approximately 4 to 1:

{odds: 4}
