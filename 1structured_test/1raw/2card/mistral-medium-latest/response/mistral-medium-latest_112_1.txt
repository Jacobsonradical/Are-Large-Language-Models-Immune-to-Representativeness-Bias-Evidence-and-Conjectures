To solve this problem, we'll calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing this combination from Deck A (P(3X,1O | Deck A)):

There are 4 choices for the O card and C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose the 3 X cards. The probability of picking an X card is 2/3 and the probability of picking an O card is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing this combination from Deck A is:

P(3X,1O | Deck A) = (4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)) / (4! / (3! \* 1!)) = 0.32

Next, let's find the probability of drawing this combination from Deck B (P(3X,1O | Deck B)):

There are 4 choices for the O card and C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose the 3 X cards. The probability of picking an X card is 1/3 and the probability of picking an O card is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing this combination from Deck B is:

P(3X,1O | Deck B) = (4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)) / (4! / (3! \* 1!)) = 0.048

Now we need to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing this combination from Deck A and Deck B:

odds = P(3X,1O | Deck A) / P(3X,1O | Deck B) = 0.32 / 0.048 = 6.6667

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 6.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

{odds: 6.67}
