Let's calculate the probabilities first and then find the odds.

1. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3.
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck A is 1/3.
   - Using binomial distribution, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is C(4,3)*(2/3)^3*(1/3)^1 = 0.4444

2. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3.
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck B is 2/3.
   - Using binomial distribution, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is C(4,3)*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^1 = 0.0889

3. Now, we can find the posterior odds:
   - The odds of drawing from Deck A vs Deck B are the ratio of their probabilities.
   - Odds = Probability of Deck A / Probability of Deck B = 0.4444 / 0.0889 â‰ˆ 5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 5.

{odds: 5}
