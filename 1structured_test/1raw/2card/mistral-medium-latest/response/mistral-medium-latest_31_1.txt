To answer this question, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods (the posterior odds).

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A, which is 0.5 (since either deck could be chosen)
P(B) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B, which is also 0.5
P(3X and 1O | A) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
P(3X and 1O | B) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

First, calculate the likelihoods:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, find the ratio of these likelihoods (the posterior odds):

odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)
odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
odds = (2^3 / 1^1) * (1^1 / 2^1)
odds = 8 / 1

So the posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.

{odds: 8}
