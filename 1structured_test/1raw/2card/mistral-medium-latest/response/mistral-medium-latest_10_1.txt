To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the following ratio:

P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, this can be rewritten as:

(P(3X and 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)) / (P(3X and 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B))

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck:

- P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81
- P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(3X and 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)) / (P(3X and 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B))
              = (8/81 \* 0.5) / (2/81 \* 0.5)
              = 8/2
              = 4

Thus, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed cards are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
