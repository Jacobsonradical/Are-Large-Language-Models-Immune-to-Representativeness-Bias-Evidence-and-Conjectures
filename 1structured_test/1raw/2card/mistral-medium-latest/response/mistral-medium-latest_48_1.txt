To calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) \* (Likelihood ratio)

Since we are selecting a deck at random, the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is 1.

Next, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* (4 choose 3) / (52 choose 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* (4 choose 3) / (52 choose 4)

The likelihood ratio is the probability of the observed data given Deck A divided by the probability of the observed data given Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)
                 = (2^3 / 1^3) \* (1^1 / 2^1)
                 = 8 / 2
                 = 4

Finally, we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) \* (Likelihood ratio)
               = 1 \* 4
               = 4

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
