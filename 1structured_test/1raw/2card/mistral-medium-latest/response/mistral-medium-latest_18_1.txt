To find the answer, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3
P(3X and 1O) = (4 choose 3) \* P(X)^3 \* P(O)^1
= (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
= 0.5211

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3
P(3X and 1O) = (4 choose 3) \* P(X)^3 \* P(O)^1
= (4! / (3! \* 1!)) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1
= 0.0741

The ratio of these probabilities (deck A to deck B) gives us the posterior odds:

odds = P(3X and 1O from deck A) / P(3X and 1O from deck B)
= 0.5211 / 0.0741
= 7.032

So the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 7.032}
