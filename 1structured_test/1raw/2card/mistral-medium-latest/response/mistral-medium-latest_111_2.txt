{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
2. There are C(N, k) ways to choose k cards from a deck of size N.
3. In Deck A, there are (2/3)N cards marked X and (1/3)N cards marked O.
4. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
   P(3X,1O | Deck A) = [C( (2/3)N, 3) \* C( (1/3)N, 1)] / C(N, 4)
5. Similarly, in Deck B, there are (1/3)N cards marked X and (2/3)N cards marked O.
6. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
   P(3X,1O | Deck B) = [C( (1/3)N, 3) \* C( (2/3)N, 1)] / C(N, 4)
7. Since we want to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the ratio of these probabilities:
   Odds(Deck A : Deck B) = P(3X,1O | Deck A) / P(3X,1O | Deck B)
8. After calculating the combinatorial terms and simplifying, we get:
   Odds(Deck A : Deck B) = 9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 9:1.
