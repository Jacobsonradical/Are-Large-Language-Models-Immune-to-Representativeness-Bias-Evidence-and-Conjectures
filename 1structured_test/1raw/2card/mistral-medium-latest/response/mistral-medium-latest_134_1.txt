To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B.

First, let's define some variables:

- P(A) = Prior probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5 (since we assume there is an equal chance of selecting either deck)
- P(B) = Prior probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5
- P(X|A) = Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
- P(O|A) = Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
- P(X|B) = Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
- P(O|B) = Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3

Now, let's find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

- Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: L(A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: L(B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Next, we'll find the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

- Posterior odds = [P(A) * L(A)] / [P(B) * L(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify this expression:

- Posterior odds = L(A) / L(B)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

- Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

The final step is to simplify and find the numerical value for the posterior odds:

- Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1) * (1 / 2^3) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8 to 1 compared to Deck B.
