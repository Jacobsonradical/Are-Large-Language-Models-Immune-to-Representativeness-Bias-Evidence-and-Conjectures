To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of selecting Deck A as A, and the event of selecting Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O is denoted by X\_tripleO.

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X\_tripleO)/P(B|X\_tripleO).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X\_tripleO) = P(X\_tripleO|A) \* P(A) / P(X\_tripleO)
P(B|X\_tripleO) = P(X\_tripleO|B) \* P(B) / P(X\_tripleO)

Given that the decks are very large, the probabilities of drawing specific cards do not depend on any previous draws. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is:

P(X\_tripleO|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is:

P(X\_tripleO|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|X_tripleO) / P(B|X_tripleO)
odds = [P(X_tripleO|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X_tripleO|B) \* P(B)]
odds = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]

odds = (2^3 / 1^3) \* (1/2^1 / 1/2^1) = 8

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A are 8:1 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 8}
