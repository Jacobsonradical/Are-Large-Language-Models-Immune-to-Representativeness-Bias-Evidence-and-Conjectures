To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting Deck A or B is equal (1/2 for each deck). The posterior odds can be calculated as follows:

odds = (P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B))

Plugging in the values:

odds = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2) = 8/2 = 4

So the final answer is:
{odds: 4}
