{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A.
   - Probability of drawing an X from deck A = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from deck A = 1/3
   - Using binomial probability formula, P(X=3) = C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 0.563

2. Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B.
   - Probability of drawing an X from deck B = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from deck B = 2/3
   - Using binomial probability formula, P(X=3) = C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 0.082

3. Now find the likelihood ratio. Likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the data under the two hypotheses (decks A and B).
   - Likelihood ratio = P(data | deck A) / P(data | deck B) = 0.563 / 0.082 ≈ 6.87

4. However, since we want the odds and not the likelihood ratio, we'll convert the likelihood ratio to odds.
   - Odds = Likelihood ratio / (1 + Likelihood ratio) ≈ 6.87 / (1 + 6.87) ≈ 9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 9.
