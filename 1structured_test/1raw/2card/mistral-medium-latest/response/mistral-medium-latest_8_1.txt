To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the posterior odds).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:
Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in the values, we get:
Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
                         = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1)
                         = 2^4
                         = 16

So the final answer is:
{odds: 16}
