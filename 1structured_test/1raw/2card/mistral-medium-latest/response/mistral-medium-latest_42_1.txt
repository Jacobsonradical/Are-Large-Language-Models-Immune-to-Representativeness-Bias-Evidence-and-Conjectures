To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio. Let's denote the events as follows:

- E: drawing 3 X's and 1 O
- A: drawing from Deck A
- B: drawing from Deck B

First, let's calculate the probabilities P(E|A) and P(E|B).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)

Using binomial probability formula for 4 draws:
P(E|A) = C(4,3) \* (P(X|A)^3) \* P(O|A)
       = 4 \* ((2/3)^3) \* (1/3)
       ≈ 0.421

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)

Using binomial probability formula for 4 draws:
P(E|B) = C(4,3) \* (P(X|B)^3) \* P(O|B)
       = 4 \* ((1/3)^3) \* (2/3)
       ≈ 0.019

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
Odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / P(E)

Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal (i.e., the decks were chosen randomly). This means that P(A) = P(B), and since their sum should be 1:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Since P(E) appears in the denominator of both P(A|E) and P(B|E), it cancels out in the odds calculation:
Odds = [P(E|A) \* P(A)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B)]
      = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)]

Therefore,
Odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B)
      = 0.421 / 0.019
       ≈ 22.16

So, the posterior odds are approximately 22.16 in favor of Deck A.
