To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are the ratio of the probability of the event given the data (P(deck A|3X, 1O)) to the probability of the alternative event given the data (P(deck B|3X, 1O)).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O|deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O|deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities. Since we don't know the prior probability of selecting each deck, we'll assume they are equally likely (P(deck A) = P(deck B) = 0.5).

For Deck A:
P(deck A|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|deck A) \* P(deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O|deck A) \* P(deck A) + P(3X, 1O|deck B) \* P(deck B)]
P(deck A|3X, 1O) = (8/81 \* 0.5) / [(8/81 \* 0.5) + (2/81 \* 0.5)]
P(deck A|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.8

For Deck B:
P(deck B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|deck B) \* P(deck B)] / [P(3X, 1O|deck A) \* P(deck A) + P(3X, 1O|deck B) \* P(deck B)]
P(deck B|3X, 1O) = (2/81 \* 0.5) / [(8/81 \* 0.5) + (2/81 \* 0.5)]
P(deck B|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.2

The posterior odds are the ratio of these probabilities:

Odds(deck A|3X, 1O) = P(deck A|3X, 1O) / P(deck B|3X, 1O)
Odds(deck A|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
