To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2

Final answer:
{odds: 4/9}

The posterior odds are 4:9 in favor of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A. However, since the question asks for a single number, I will provide just the numerator:

{odds: 4}
