To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A, and P(B) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B. Since one of the decks is chosen randomly, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = (P(A) * P(3X and 1O | A)) / (P(B) * P(3X and 1O | B))
odds = (0.5 * 8/81) / (0.5 * 2/81)
odds = 4

So the answer is:
{odds: 4}
