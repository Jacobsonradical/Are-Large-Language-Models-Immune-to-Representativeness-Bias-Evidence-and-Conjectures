{odds: 4.5}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A first.
2. The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and that of drawing an O is 1/3.
3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.0972.
4. Similarly, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
5. The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and that of drawing an O is 2/3.
6. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0185.
7. The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are the ratio of their probabilities: 0.0972 / 0.0185 = 4.5.

Therefore, the answer is {odds: 4.5}.
