To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data.

Let HA represent the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and HB represent the hypothesis that they were drawn from Deck B. Let D represent the data observed (3 X's and 1 O).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(HA|D) = P(D|HA) \* P(HA) / P(D)
P(HB|D) = P(D|HB) \* P(HB) / P(D)

Since we are only considering two possibilities (drawing from Deck A or Deck B), the prior probabilities are equal: P(HA) = P(HB) = 0.5.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the two posterior probabilities:
Odds = [P(HA|D) / P(HB|D)] = [P(D|HA) / P(D|HB)]

The prior probabilities cancel out in the ratio, so we only need to calculate the likelihoods P(D|HA) and P(D|HB).

1. Calculate P(D|HA):
   Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
   P(D|HA) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

2. Calculate P(D|HB):
   Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
   P(D|HB) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

3. Calculate the posterior odds:
   Odds = [P(D|HA) / P(D|HB)]

{odds: ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)}

{odds: 8}
