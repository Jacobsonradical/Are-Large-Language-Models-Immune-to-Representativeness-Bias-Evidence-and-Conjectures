To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we find the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Plugging in our values:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Calculating the expression:

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (1/27)

Simplifying the expression:

Posterior odds = 8

So, the answer is:

{odds: 8}
