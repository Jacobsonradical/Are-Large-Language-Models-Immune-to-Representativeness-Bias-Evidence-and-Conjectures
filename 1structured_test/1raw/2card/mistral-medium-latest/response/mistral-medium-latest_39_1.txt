To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks A and B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X,1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X,1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, since we have chosen one of the decks by chance, the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, i.e., 1:1. We multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio (the ratio of the probabilities calculated above) to get the posterior odds.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Likelihood ratio = P(3X,1O | Deck A) / P(3X,1O | Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
