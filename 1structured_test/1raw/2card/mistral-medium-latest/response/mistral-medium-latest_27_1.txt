To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.

Using binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = C(4, 3) * ((2/3)^3) * ((1/3)^1)
P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = 0.4444

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = C(4, 3) * ((1/3)^3) * ((2/3)^1)
P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = 0.0741

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Since our initial assumption was that both decks were equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1.

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
Posterior odds = 0.4444 / 0.0741
Posterior odds â‰ˆ 6

So, the posterior odds favor Deck A over Deck B by a factor of 6.
