To solve this problem, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the deck A as H₁, and the deck B as H₂. We want to find the odds P(H₁|E) / P(H₂|E). By using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

(P(E|H₁) \* P(H₁)) / (P(E|H₂) \* P(H₂))

Since we don't know which deck has been selected initially, we can assume that the prior probabilities are equal: P(H₁) = P(H₂) = 0.5. The odds then become:

P(E|H₁) / P(E|H₂)

Now, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(E|H₁) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(E|H₂) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.008

The posterior odds are:

odds = P(E|H₁) / P(E|H₂) ≈ 0.093 / 0.008 ≈ 11.625

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 11.625 to 1.

{odds: 11.625}
