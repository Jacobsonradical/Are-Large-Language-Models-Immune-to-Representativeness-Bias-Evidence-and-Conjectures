To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote:
P(A) = probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5
P(B) = probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the answer is:
{odds: 4}
