To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we will compute the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards came from Deck A, and divide it by the likelihood of observing the same configuration given that the cards came from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A are:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.
