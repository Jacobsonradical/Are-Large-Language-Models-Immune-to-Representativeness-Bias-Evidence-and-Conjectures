To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the events:
A: The deck chosen is deck A
B: The deck chosen is deck B
X: Drawing a card marked X
O: Drawing a card marked O

First, we find P(A) and P(B). Since the decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Next, we find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.022

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities of drawing from each deck given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O:

P(A | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]
P(A | 3X and 1O) ≈ (0.093 \* 0.5) / [(0.093 \* 0.5) + (0.022 \* 0.5)] ≈ 0.808

Similarly,
P(B | 3X and 1O) ≈ 0.192

Finally, we calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

odds ≈ 0.808 / 0.192 ≈ 4.208

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 4.208.

{odds: 4.208}
