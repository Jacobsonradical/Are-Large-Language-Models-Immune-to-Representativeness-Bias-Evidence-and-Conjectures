To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the events:

- A: Drawing from Deck A
- B: Drawing from Deck B
- X: Drawing a card marked X
- O: Drawing a card marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO). By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) \* P(B) / P(XXXO)

Since we're assuming a random selection of either deck, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. As such, the prior odds are 1:1, and the denominator P(XXXO) cancels out when finding the posterior odds. Thus, we need to calculate P(XXXO|A) and P(XXXO|B).

In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, in deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO) = [P(XXXO|A) \* P(A)] / [P(XXXO|B) \* P(B)] = [P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

{odds: 4}
