To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio.

Let's denote the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B as P(A) and P(B), respectively.

For Deck A:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds are simply the ratio of these probabilities:

odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
