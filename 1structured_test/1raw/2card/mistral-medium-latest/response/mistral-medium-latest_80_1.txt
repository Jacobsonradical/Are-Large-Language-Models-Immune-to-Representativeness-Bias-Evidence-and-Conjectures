To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed data, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting either deck, the prior odds are 1.

The likelihood ratio is calculated as the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing the same from Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 1 O is (1/3)^1, and the probability of drawing 3 X's is (2/3)^3. The total probability for this combination is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 1 X is (1/3)^1, and the probability of drawing 3 O's is (2/3)^3. The total probability for this combination is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3

The likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3)
Likelihood ratio = (2/3)^2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 \* (2/3)^2

{odds: (2/3)^2}
