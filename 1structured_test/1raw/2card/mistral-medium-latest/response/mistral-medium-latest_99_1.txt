{odds: 3.0}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem asks for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.
2. Let's denote the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B as P(A) and P(B), respectively. Since the deck selection is by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.0972.
4. Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0208.
5. Now, we want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed data.
6. Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) \* P(A)] / [P(data|B) \* P(B)] = [0.0972 \* 0.5] / [0.0208 \* 0.5] = 3.0
7. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3.0.
