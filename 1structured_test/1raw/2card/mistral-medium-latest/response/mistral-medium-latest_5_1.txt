To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks A and B, and then find the ratio of these likelihoods (the posterior odds).

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the probabilities:
odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
