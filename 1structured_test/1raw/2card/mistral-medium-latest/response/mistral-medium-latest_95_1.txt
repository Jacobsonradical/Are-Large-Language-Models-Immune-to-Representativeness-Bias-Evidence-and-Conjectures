To find the posterior odds, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Let's denote the event of selecting Deck A as $A$ and Deck B as $B$. The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is denoted as $X_{3}O_{1}$. We're interested in finding the odds $\frac{P(A \mid X_{3}O_{1})}{P(B \mid X_{3}O_{1})}$. By Bayes' theorem:

$$\frac{P(A \mid X_{3}O_{1})}{P(B \mid X_{3}O_{1})} = \frac{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}$$

Since we've selected one of the decks by chance, $P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the odds become:

$$\frac{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid A)}{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid B)}$$

Now, let's calculate $P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid A)$ and $P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid B)$:

- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are marked X):
  $P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^3(\frac{1}{3})^1 = \frac{16}{81}$

- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are marked X):
  $P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3}(\frac{1}{3})^3(\frac{2}{3})^1 = \frac{8}{81}$

Now, we can calculate the odds:

$$\frac{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid A)}{P(X_{3}O_{1} \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{16}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \boxed{2}$$

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2:1 compared to Deck B.
