To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately, and then take their ratio.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 0.328

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 0.019

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

odds = 0.328 / 0.019 = 17.26

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 17.26 to 1 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 17.26}
