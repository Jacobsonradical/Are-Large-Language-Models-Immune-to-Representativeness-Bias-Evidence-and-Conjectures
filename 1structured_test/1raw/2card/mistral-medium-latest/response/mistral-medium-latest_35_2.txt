To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the deck chosen is A as HA and the event that it's B as HB. The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O is denoted as E. We want to find the posterior odds P(HA|E) / P(HB|E).

First, calculate the prior odds: since there are two decks, the prior odds are 1.

Next, find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks:

P(E|HA) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(E|HB) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0096

Now, use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(HA) * P(E|HA)] / [P(HB) * P(E|HB)]

Since the prior probabilities are equal, this simplifies to:

Posterior odds = P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)

Plug in the values:

Posterior odds ≈ 0.093 / 0.0096 ≈ 9.69

{odds: 9.69}
