{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 2^3 / 3^4 = 8 / 81

2. Similarly, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2 / 3^4 = 2 / 81

3. Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities obtained in steps 1 and 2:
   - Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8 / 81) / (2 / 81) = 8 / 2 = 9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 9.
