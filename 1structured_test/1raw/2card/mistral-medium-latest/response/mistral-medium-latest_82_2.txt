To solve this problem, we will calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we assume that the prior probability of selecting either deck is equal (1/2 for Deck A and 1/2 for Deck B). The posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A * Prior probability of Deck A) / (Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B * Prior probability of Deck B)

Posterior odds = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)

Posterior odds = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
