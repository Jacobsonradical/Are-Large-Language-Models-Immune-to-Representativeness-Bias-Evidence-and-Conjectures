To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
