To answer this question, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X,1O | Deck A) = P(X)^3 * P(O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Next, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X,1O | Deck B) = P(X)^3 * P(O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the likelihoods:
posterior odds = [P(3X,1O | Deck A)] / [P(3X,1O | Deck B)]
                      = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
                      = (2^3)^2 / (1^3 * 2)
                      = 64/2
                      = 32

{odds: 32}
