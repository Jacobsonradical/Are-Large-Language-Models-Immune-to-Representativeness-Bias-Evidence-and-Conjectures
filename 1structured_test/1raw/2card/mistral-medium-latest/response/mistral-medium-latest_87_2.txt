To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing from Deck B as P(B). Similarly, let's denote the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B as P(3X,1O | A) and P(3X,1O | B), respectively.

The prior odds are simply P(A)/P(B), which is equal to 1 since there is no prior information given that suggests one deck is more likely to be selected than the other.

To calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, we need to multiply the probability of drawing an X from Deck A three times and the probability of drawing an O from Deck A once:

P(3X,1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, we need to multiply the probability of drawing an X from Deck B three times and the probability of drawing an O from Deck B once:

P(3X,1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the ratio of the likelihoods:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* (Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Plugging in the values we calculated above:

Posterior odds = 1 \* ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Simplifying the equation:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2

So the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, are 4:1.
