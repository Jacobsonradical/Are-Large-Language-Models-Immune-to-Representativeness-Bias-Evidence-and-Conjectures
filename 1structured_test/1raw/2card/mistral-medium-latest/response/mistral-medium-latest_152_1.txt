To solve this problem, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the odds.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing this combination from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing this combination from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing this combination from Deck A by the probability of drawing it from Deck B:

Odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

Odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
