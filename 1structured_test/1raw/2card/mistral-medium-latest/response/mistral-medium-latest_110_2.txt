To answer this question, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as H₁, and the event of selecting Deck B as H₂.

First, let's find P(E|H₁), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck A was selected:

P(E|H₁) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find P(E|H₂), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck B was selected:

P(E|H₂) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

odds = P(E|H₁) / P(E|H₂) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A.

{odds: 4}
