To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

3. Posterior odds:
Odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
