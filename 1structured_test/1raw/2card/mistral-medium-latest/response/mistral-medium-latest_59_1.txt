To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Let p(A) be the prior probability of selecting Deck A (which is 0.5 since either deck could have been chosen). Let's use the binomial probability formula:

p(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Where C(4, 3) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose 3 X's from 4 cards. It's equal to 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

p(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

To find the posterior odds, we'll take the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior odds = p(3X and 1O | Deck A) / p(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in our values:

Posterior odds = (4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
               = (2/3)^2
               = 4/9

However, you asked for the answer as a single number, so we'll take the reciprocal to express it as odds in favor of Deck A:

odds = 9/4

So the answer is:
{odds: 9/4}
