To find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are equal (1:1). Then, the posterior odds can be calculated as follows:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 4:1.
