To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately. Then, we will take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1/2^1) / (1^3 / 2^3) * (2^1 / 1^1)

Posterior odds = 8 / (1/8)

odds: 64
