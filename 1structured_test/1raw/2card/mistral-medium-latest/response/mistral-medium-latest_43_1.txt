To answer this question, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from deck A versus deck B given the observed data. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of drawing from deck A, which is 0.5 since there are two decks and they are equally likely to be chosen.
- P(B) as the prior probability of drawing from deck B, which is also 0.5.
- P(D|A) as the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O when drawing from deck A.
- P(D|B) as the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O when drawing from deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be written as:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

Posterior odds = [P(D|A) \* P(A)] / [P(D|B) \* P(B)]

Since P(A) and P(B) are equal, we can simplify this expression:

Posterior odds = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(D|A) and P(D|B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A can be calculated using binomial probabilities:

P(D|A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(D|B) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing P(D|A) by P(D|B):

Posterior odds = [(8/64) / (1/64)] = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing from deck A versus deck B is 8:

{odds: 8}
