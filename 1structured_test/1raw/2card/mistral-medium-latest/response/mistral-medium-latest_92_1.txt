To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards are marked X, this probability is:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards are marked X, this probability is:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in our values, we get:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Calculating the above expression:

Posterior odds = (8 / 27) / (1 / 27)
Posterior odds = 8

So the final answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 8}
