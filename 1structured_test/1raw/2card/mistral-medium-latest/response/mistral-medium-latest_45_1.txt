To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.5333

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0889

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds as the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) ≈ 5.98

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 5.98 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 5.98}
