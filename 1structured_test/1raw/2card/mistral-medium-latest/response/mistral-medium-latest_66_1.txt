To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately, then take their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243 ≈ 0.0329

Next, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243 ≈ 0.0082

Now we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:
odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = 0.0329 / 0.0082 ≈ 4

{odds: 4}
