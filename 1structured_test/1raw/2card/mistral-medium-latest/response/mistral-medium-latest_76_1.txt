To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). The probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck are:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the prior odds, which are equal since we chose a deck at random.
Odds(A) = P(A) / P(B) = 1/1

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Odds(A) \* (P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B))
Posterior odds = (1/1) \* (8/81 / 2/81)
Posterior odds = 8/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8 to 2.
