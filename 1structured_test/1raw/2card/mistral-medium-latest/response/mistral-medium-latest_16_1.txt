To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:
Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                         = 8/81 / 2/81
                         = 8/2
                         = 4

So the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
