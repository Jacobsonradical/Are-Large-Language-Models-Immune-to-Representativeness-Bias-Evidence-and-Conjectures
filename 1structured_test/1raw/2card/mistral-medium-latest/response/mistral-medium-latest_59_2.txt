To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck first.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck A) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)
= 4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)
≈ 0.5333

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck B) = C(4,3) \* (P(X)^3) \* P(O)
= 4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)
≈ 0.0889

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B is equal (0.5 each). Let P(A) and P(B) be the posterior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X and 1O) = [P(3X and 1O|A) \* P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O|A) \* P(A) + P(3X and 1O|B) \* P(B)]
≈ [0.5333 \* 0.5] / [(0.5333 \* 0.5) + (0.0889 \* 0.5)]
≈ 0.8571

P(B|3X and 1O) = [P(3X and 1O|B) \* P(B)] / [P(3X and 1O|A) \* P(A) + P(3X and 1O|B) \* P(B)]
≈ [0.0889 \* 0.5] / [(0.5333 \* 0.5) + (0.0889 \* 0.5)]
≈ 0.1429

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the posterior probabilities:

Odds(A|3X and 1O) = P(A|3X and 1O) / P(B|3X and 1O)
≈ 0.8571 / 0.1429
≈ 6

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are about 6 to 1.
