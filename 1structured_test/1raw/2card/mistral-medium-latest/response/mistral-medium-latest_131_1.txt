To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The deck is Deck A
B: The deck is Deck B
X: Drawing a card marked X
O: Drawing a card marked O

We want to find P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO), which by Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) \* P(B) / P(XXXO)

Since we have selected one of the decks at random, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. Also, the denominator P(XXXO) will cancel out when taking the ratio, so we can ignore it. Therefore, we just need to calculate the likelihoods P(XXXO|A) and P(XXXO|B).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

Using binomial probability formula for 4 trials with 3 successes (X):

P(XXXO|A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
                 = 4! / (3! \* 1!) \* (8/27) \* (1/3)
                 = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

Using binomial probability formula for 4 trials with 1 success (X):

P(XXXO|B) = C(4, 1) \* (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3
                 = 4! / (1! \* 3!) \* (1/3) \* (8/27)
                 = 32/243

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO)
      = [P(XXXO|A) \* P(A)] / [P(XXXO|B) \* P(B)]
      = (32/81) / (32/243)
      = 243 / 81

So, the posterior odds in favor of drawing from Deck A are 243:81. Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 243/81}
