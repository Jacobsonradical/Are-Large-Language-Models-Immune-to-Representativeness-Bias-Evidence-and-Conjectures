To calculate the posterior odds, we'll first find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of selecting Deck A, and P(B) be the prior probability of selecting Deck B. Since the decks are equally likely to be chosen, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

odds = [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify this to:

odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Plugging in our calculated probabilities:

odds = 8/81 / 2/81 = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, is 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
