{odds: 4.0}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A first.
2. There are C(n, k) ways to choose k cards from n cards. So, there are C(4,3) ways to choose 3 cards from 4.
3. The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is (C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / C(4,3) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81.
4. Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is (C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1) / C(4,3) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81.
5. The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1 since there's no reason to favor one deck over the other.
6. The likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B is (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.
7. The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B is the product of the prior odds (1) and the likelihood ratio, which is 1 \* 4 = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
