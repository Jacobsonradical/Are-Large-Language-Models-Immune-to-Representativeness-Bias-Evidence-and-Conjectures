To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A to the likelihood of drawing the same from deck B, multiplied by the prior odds (which are 1:1 if we have no prior knowledge).

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, and the event of selecting deck A as HA. Then, we want to find the odds P(HA|E)/P(HB|E).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E|HA) and P(E|HB).

P(E|HA) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 since 2/3 of the cards in deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
P(E|HB) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 since 1/3 of the cards in deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(HA|E) / P(HB|E) = P(E|HA) \* P(HA) / P(E|HB) \* P(HB)

Since the prior odds P(HA)/P(HB) are equal to 1, the posterior odds simplify to:

odds = P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)

Plugging in the values for P(E|HA) and P(E|HB), we get:

odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1) = 8

So the answer is:

{odds: 8}
