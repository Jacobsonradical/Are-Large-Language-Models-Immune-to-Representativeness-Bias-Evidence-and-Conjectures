To calculate the posterior odds, we'll first find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks A and B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

1. Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the hypothesis that the deck is A as H\_A, and the hypothesis that the deck is B as H\_B. We want to find the posterior odds P(H\_A|E) / P(H\_B|E).

First, we'll find P(H\_A|E) and P(H\_B|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H\_A|E) = P(E|H\_A) \* P(H\_A) / P(E)
P(H\_B|E) = P(E|H\_B) \* P(H\_B) / P(E)

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(H\_A) = P(H\_B) = 0.5. Since the denominator P(E) is the same for both, we can focus on the product of the likelihood and prior probabilities:

- P(E|H\_A) \* P(H\_A) = (8/81) \* 0.5
- P(E|H\_B) \* P(H\_B) = (2/81) \* 0.5

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = [P(H\_A|E) / P(H\_B|E)] = [(8/81) \* 0.5 / ((2/81) \* 0.5)] = 4
