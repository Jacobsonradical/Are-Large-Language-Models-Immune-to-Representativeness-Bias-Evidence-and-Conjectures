To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from deck A versus deck B.

First, let's define some events:
A: The event that the cards were drawn from deck A
B: The event that the cards were drawn from deck B
X: The event that a card is marked X
O: The event that a card is marked O

We're given the following probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the decks are chosen by chance)
P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) \* P(B) / P(XXXO)

Since both decks have the same prior probability, we can ignore the denominator P(XXXO) when calculating the odds. Therefore:

Posterior Odds = (P(XXXO|A) \* P(A)) / (P(XXXO|B) \* P(B))

Now, let's find P(XXXO|A) and P(XXXO|B). We can treat each draw as independent, so:

P(XXXO|A) = P(X|A)^3 \* P(O|A)^1 = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
P(XXXO|B) = P(X|B)^3 \* P(O|B)^1 = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)
                        = (2^3 / 3^3) / (1/3)^3
                        = 2^6 / 1
                        = 64

{odds: 64}
