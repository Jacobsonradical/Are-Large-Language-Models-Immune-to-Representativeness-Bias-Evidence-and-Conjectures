To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the likelihood ratio or the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting deck A as HA, and the event of selecting deck B as HB.

First, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A (P(E|HA)):

There are 4 choices for the position of the O in the 4-card hand, so there are 4C1 = 4 possible combinations. The probability of each combination is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 for the specific cards drawn. Therefore:

P(E|HA) = 4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.5333

Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B (P(E|HB)):

Similarly, there are 4 possible combinations. The probability of each combination is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 for the specific cards drawn. Therefore:

P(E|HB) = 4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0926

Now, find the likelihood ratio or the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(E|HA) / P(E|HB) ≈ 0.5333 / 0.0926 ≈ 5.7596

So, the posterior odds are approximately 5.76:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A.

{odds: 5.7596}
