To calculate the posterior odds, we'll first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then, we'll take the ratio of these probabilities.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O | A) = C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
               = 4 \* (8/27) \* (1/3)
               = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O | B) = C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1
               = 4 \* (1/27) \* (2/3)
               = 8/81

Now, we'll calculate the posterior odds (odd A : odd B):
Posterior odds = P(3X,1O | A) / P(3X,1O | B)
               = (32/81) / (8/81)
               = 32/8

{odds: 32/8}

Confidence: 95%
