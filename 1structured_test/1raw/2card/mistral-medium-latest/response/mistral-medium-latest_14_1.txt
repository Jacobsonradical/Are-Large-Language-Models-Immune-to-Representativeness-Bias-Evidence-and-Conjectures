To find the answer, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events A and B. In this case, event A is drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, and event B is drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. The prior probabilities of drawing from decks A and B are equal (1/2).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.008

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities of drawing from each deck, given the observed cards:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]
P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) ≈ 0.093 \* 0.5 / (0.093 \* 0.5 + 0.008 \* 0.5) ≈ 0.922

P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]
P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) ≈ 0.008 \* 0.5 / (0.093 \* 0.5 + 0.008 \* 0.5) ≈ 0.078

Now that we have the posterior probabilities, we can calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) ≈ 0.922 / 0.078 ≈ 11.8

So the odds in favor of Deck A are approximately 11.8:
