To solve this problem, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X is 2/3 and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 4! / (3! \* 1!)

Using the same logic, we can calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 4! / (3! \* 1!)

Now, let's find the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B. Since there's no information about the selection process, we'll assume that the prior odds are equal to 1.

Odds(Deck A : Deck B) = 1 : 1

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the ratio of the likelihoods:

Posterior odds = Odds(Deck A : Deck B) \* (P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B))

Calculating the likelihoods and the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (1 : 1) \* ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds = (1 : 1) \* (8 : 1)

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 8}
