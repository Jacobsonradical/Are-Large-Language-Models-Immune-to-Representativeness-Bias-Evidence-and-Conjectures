To solve this problem, we will calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's denote the event that the deck chosen is A as E1, and the event that it's B as E2. The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O will be denoted as F.

We are given the prior probabilities: P(E1) = P(E2) = 0.5 (since either deck can be selected with equal probability).

Now, let's find P(F|E1) and P(F|E2).

Since 2/3 of the cards in deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we have:
P(F|E1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, since 1/3 of the cards in deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we have:
P(F|E2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(E1|F) = P(F|E1) \* P(E1) / [P(F|E1) \* P(E1) + P(F|E2) \* P(E2)]
P(E1|F) = (8/81 \* 0.5) / [(8/81 \* 0.5) + (2/81 \* 0.5)] = 8/10

P(E2|F) = P(F|E2) \* P(E2) / [P(F|E1) \* P(E1) + P(F|E2) \* P(E2)]
P(E2|F) = (2/81 \* 0.5) / [(8/81 \* 0.5) + (2/81 \* 0.5)] = 2/10

Finally, let's find the posterior odds:

Odds(E1|F) = P(E1|F) / P(E2|F) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
