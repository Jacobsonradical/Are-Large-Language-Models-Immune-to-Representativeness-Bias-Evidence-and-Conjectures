To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which relates the posterior odds to the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote:
H\_A as the hypothesis "the cards were drawn from Deck A"
H\_B as the hypothesis "the cards were drawn from Deck B"
D as the observed data "3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O"

We want to find the posterior odds P(H\_A|D)/P(H\_B|D). By Bayes' theorem, this can be written as:

[P(H\_A|D)/P(H\_B|D)] = [P(H\_A)/P(H\_B)] \* [P(D|H\_A)/P(D|H\_B)]

Assuming that there's no prior information favoring one deck over the other, the prior odds P(H\_A)/P(H\_B) are equal to 1.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods P(D|H\_A) and P(D|H\_B). This can be done using the binomial probability formula:

P(D|H\_A) = (4 choose 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1
P(D|H\_B) = (4 choose 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

[P(D|H\_A)/P(D|H\_B)] = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]

Since (4 choose 3) cancels out in the likelihood ratio, we don't need to compute it explicitly.

Finally, the posterior odds are:

[P(H\_A|D)/P(H\_B|D)] = [P(H\_A)/P(H\_B)] \* [P(D|H\_A)/P(D|H\_B)] = 1 \* [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1]

So the posterior odds in favor of Deck A are:

odds: (2/3)^2 = 0.44444444444^2 ≈ 0.197959

However, since the question asks for the odds compared to Deck B, the answer should be:

odds: 1 / 0.197959 ≈ 5.047128

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed data are approximately 5.05 to 1.
