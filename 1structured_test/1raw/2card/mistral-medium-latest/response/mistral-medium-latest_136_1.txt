To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's define some terms:

- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B. Since no information is given about the likelihood of selecting one deck over the other, we'll assume they are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5).
- P(X|A) and P(O|A) are the probabilities of drawing an X or an O from Deck A, respectively. Similarly, P(X|B) and P(O|B) are the probabilities of drawing an X or an O from Deck B.
- P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B) are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A or Deck B, respectively.

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be represented as:

`odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)`

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite the terms in the odds ratio:

`P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O)`
`P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X,1O)`

Since P(A) = P(B) and P(3X,1O) appears in both the numerator and denominator, we can simplify the expression for the odds:

`odds = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)`

Now, we'll calculate P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B):

- For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial distribution:

  `P(3X,1O|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1`, where C(4,3) is the number of combinations of choosing 3 X's from 4 draws.

- Similarly, for Deck B:

  `P(3X,1O|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1`

Now, we can calculate the odds:

`odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) = (2^3 * 1/3) / (1^3 * 2/3) = 8/1`

So the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 8 to 1.
