To answer this question, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the event that the deck chosen is Deck A as HA, and the event that it's Deck B as HB. The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O is denoted as E. We want to find the posterior odds P(HA|E)/P(HB|E).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(HA|E)/P(HB|E) = [P(E|HA) \* P(HA)] / [P(E|HB) \* P(HB)]

Since we don't know the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B, let's assume they are equal, i.e., P(HA) = P(HB) = 0.5. Then, the prior odds cancel out, and we only need to find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(E|HA) / P(E|HB)

To find P(E|HA) and P(E|HB), we need to use the binomial distribution, which models the number of successes (in this case, drawing an X) in a fixed number of trials (drawing 4 cards). The probability mass function of the binomial distribution is:

P(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) \* p^k \* (1-p)^(n-k),

where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success on each trial, and n and k are non-negative integers with n ≥ k.

For Deck A:
P(E|HA) = P(3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.3889

For Deck B:
P(E|HB) = P(3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0444

So, the likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = P(E|HA) / P(E|HB) ≈ 0.3889 / 0.0444 ≈ 8.7585

Since the prior odds canceled out, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio ≈ 8.7585

{odds: 8.7585}
