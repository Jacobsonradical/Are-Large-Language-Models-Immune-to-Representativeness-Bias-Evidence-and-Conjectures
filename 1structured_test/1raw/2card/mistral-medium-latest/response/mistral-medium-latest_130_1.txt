{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
   - So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 0.48

2. Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
   - So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 0.027

3. To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we can divide the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: 0.48 / 0.027 = 9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 9.
