To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then find the ratio of the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of selecting deck A as P(A) and the probability of selecting deck B as P(B), which are equal since the selection is by chance. To simplify the calculation, let's assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by calculating the ratio of the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

Posterior odds = [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) and P(B) are equal, we can simplify this expression:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Now, let's plug in the values we found earlier:

Posterior odds = 8/81 / 2/81 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
