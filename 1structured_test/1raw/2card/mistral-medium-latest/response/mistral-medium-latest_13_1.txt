To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:
Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in the values:
Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplifying:
Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1)
                      = 8 / (1/2)
                      = 16

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 16.

{odds: 16}
