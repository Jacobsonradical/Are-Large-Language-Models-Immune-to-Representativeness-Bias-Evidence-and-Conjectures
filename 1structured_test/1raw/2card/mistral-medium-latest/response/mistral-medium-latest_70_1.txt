To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A divided by the probability of drawing the same combination from deck B.

Let's denote P(A) and P(B) as the prior probabilities of selecting deck A or deck B, respectively. Since there is no information given about the likelihood of selecting one deck over the other, we'll assume they are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, denoted P(3X,1O|A):

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B, denoted P(3X,1O|B):

P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds, O(A), which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing the observed combination from deck A and deck B:

O(A) = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4.

The answer in the required format is:

{odds: 4}
