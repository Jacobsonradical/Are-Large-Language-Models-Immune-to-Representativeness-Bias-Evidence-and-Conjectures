To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of selecting deck A as P(A) and the probability of selecting deck B as P(B). Since the choice of decks is random, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243 ≈ 0.0329

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243 ≈ 0.0082

Now, we can find the posterior odds in favor of deck A:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

By using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

Posterior odds = [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, we can simplify this expression to:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (8/243) / (2/243) = 8/2 ≈ 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are approximately 4 to 1.
