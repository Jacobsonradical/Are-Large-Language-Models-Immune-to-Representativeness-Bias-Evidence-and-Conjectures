To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1^1 / 2^1)

Posterior odds = 8 / 2

{odds: 4}
