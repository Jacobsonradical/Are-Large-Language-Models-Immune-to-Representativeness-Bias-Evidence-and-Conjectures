To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both Deck A and Deck B, and then take the ratio of those probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
