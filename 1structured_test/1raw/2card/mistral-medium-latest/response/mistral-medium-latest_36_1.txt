To solve this question, we need to find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal, i.e., P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)] / [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A) + P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]

And:

P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)] / [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A) + P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B)]

We are interested in the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Plugging in the values:

Posterior odds = (8/81 \* 0.5) / (2/81 \* 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
