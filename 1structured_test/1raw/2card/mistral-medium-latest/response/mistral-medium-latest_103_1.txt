To solve this problem, we want to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B given our observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

First, we'll calculate the likelihood of observing this data from each deck:

P(data | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(data | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B by dividing the likelihoods:

odds = P(data | Deck A) / P(data | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4:

{odds: 4}
