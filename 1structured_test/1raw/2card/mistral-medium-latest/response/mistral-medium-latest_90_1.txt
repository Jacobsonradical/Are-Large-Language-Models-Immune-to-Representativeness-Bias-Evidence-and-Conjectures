To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these likelihoods. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the likelihoods:
odds = P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
