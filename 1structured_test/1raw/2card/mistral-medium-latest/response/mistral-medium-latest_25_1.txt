To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of choosing deck A as HA, and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E. We want to find the odds P(HA|E) / P(HB|E).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E|HA) and P(E|HB). For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(E|HA) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243

For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(E|HB) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243

Now, we know that the prior probabilities of choosing either deck are equal, i.e., P(HA) = P(HB) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(HA|E) = P(E|HA) \* P(HA) / P(E)
P(HB|E) = P(E|HB) \* P(HB) / P(E)

Since the prior probabilities are equal, the denominators P(E) will cancel out when calculating the odds:

odds = P(HA|E) / P(HB|E) = [P(E|HA) \* P(HA)] / [P(E|HB) \* P(HB)]

Substituting the values, we get:

odds = (8/243 \* 1/2) / (2/243 \* 1/2) = 8/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:2 or 4:1.
