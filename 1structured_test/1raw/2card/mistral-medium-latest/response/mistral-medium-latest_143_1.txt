To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given our observed data.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: Drawing from Deck A
- B: Drawing from Deck B
- X: Drawing an X card
- O: Drawing an O card

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO).

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing the sequence XXXO from each deck:

P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.093
P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.008

Now, since we picked a deck at random, the prior probabilities of drawing from either deck are equal: P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) \* P(B) / P(XXXO)

Assuming that the events A and B are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, we have:

P(XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) + P(XXXO|B) \* P(B)

Since P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, we get:

P(XXXO) ≈ 0.093 \* 0.5 + 0.008 \* 0.5 = 0.048 + 0.004 = 0.052

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO) = [P(XXXO|A) \* P(A)] / [P(XXXO|B) \* P(B)] \* P(XXXO|B) / P(XXXO|A)

Since P(A) = P(B), this simplifies to:

Posterior odds ≈ P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B) ≈ 0.093 / 0.008 = 11.625

{odds: 11.625}
