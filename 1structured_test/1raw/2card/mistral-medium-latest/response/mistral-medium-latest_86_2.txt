To calculate the posterior odds, we'll need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O|A) = C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.369

Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O|B) = C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.074

The posterior odds in favor of Deck A are the ratio of these probabilities:
odds = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B) ≈ 0.369 / 0.074 ≈ 5.01

{odds: 5.01}
