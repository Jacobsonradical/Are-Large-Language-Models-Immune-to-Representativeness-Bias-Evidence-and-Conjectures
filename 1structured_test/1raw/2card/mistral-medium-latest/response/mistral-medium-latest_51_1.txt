To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately, and then find their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, find the ratio of these probabilities to obtain the posterior odds:

posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^3) * (1^1 / 2^1)

posterior odds = 8 / 2

odds: 4

This means that the 4 cards are 4 times more likely to have been drawn from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed outcome of 3 X's and 1 O.
