To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then find the posterior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P(3X,1O | Deck A)):

P(3X | Deck A) = (2/3)^3
P(1O | Deck A) = (1/3)^1

Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:

P(3X,1O | Deck A) = P(3X | Deck A) \* P(1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (P(3X,1O | Deck B)):

P(3X | Deck B) = (1/3)^3
P(1O | Deck B) = (2/3)^1

Again, since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:

P(3X,1O | Deck B) = P(3X | Deck B) \* P(1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3X,1O | Deck A) / P(3X,1O | Deck B)

Finally, let's compute the ratio:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

The posterior odds can be simplified as follows:

Posterior odds = (2^3 / 1^1) / (1^3 / 2^1) = 2^4 / 1^2 = 16

{odds: 16}
