To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (C(4,3) \* P(X)^3 \* P(O)) = (4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)) ≈ 0.308

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (C(4,3) \* P(X)^3 \* P(O)) = (4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)) ≈ 0.042

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.308 / 0.042 ≈ 7.33

{odds: 7.33}
