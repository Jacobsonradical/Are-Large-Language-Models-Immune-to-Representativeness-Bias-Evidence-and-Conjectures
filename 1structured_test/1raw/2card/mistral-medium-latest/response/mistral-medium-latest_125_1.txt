To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the odds.

First, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(3X and 1O | Deck A):
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- Since we are drawing 4 cards without replacement, we need to use combinations to account for the different orders in which the cards can be drawn.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.4444

P(3X and 1O | Deck B):
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- Following the same logic as before, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0889

Now that we have the probabilities, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = 0.4444 / 0.0889 â‰ˆ 5

So the answer is:
{odds: 5}
