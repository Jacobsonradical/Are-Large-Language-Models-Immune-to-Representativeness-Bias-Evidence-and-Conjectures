To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing from Deck B as P(B). The probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B are denoted as P(X3O|A) and P(X3O|B), respectively.

The prior odds are 1:1 since there is no prior reason to prefer one deck over the other.

First, let's find the probabilities P(X3O|A) and P(X3O|B).

For Deck A:
P(X3O|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/243 ≈ 0.0329

For Deck B:
P(X3O|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81 ≈ 0.0247

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

posterior odds = P(A|X3O) / P(B|X3O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite the posterior probabilities in terms of the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

P(A|X3O) = P(X3O|A) \* P(A) / P(X3O)
P(B|X3O) = P(X3O|B) \* P(B) / P(X3O)

Since P(A) = P(B) and P(X3O) appears in both the numerator and denominator of the posterior odds, we can simplify the expression:

posterior odds = P(X3O|A) / P(X3O|B)

So the posterior odds are:

odds = 0.0329 / 0.0247 ≈ 1.33

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 1.33:1.

{odds: 1.33}
