To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio. Let's denote the probability of selecting Deck A as P(A) and Deck B as P(B), which are equal since the selection is by chance.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

After calculating the values:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3

Posterior odds = 8

{odds: 8}
