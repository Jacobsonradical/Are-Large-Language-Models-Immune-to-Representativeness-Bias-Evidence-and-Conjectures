To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take their ratio.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. There are 4 choose 3 ways to draw 3 X's from 4 cards, and the probability of each card being X is 2/3. So the probability of drawing 3 X's is (4 choose 3) \* (2/3)^3 = 4 \* (8/27) = 32/27. The probability of drawing 1 O is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (32/27) \* (1/3) = 32/81.

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing 1 X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing 3 O's is (2/3)^3 = 8/27. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (4 choose 1) \* (1/3)^3 \* (8/27) = 4 \* (1/27) \* (8/27) = 32/19683.

Finally, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are the ratio of the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Therefore, the posterior odds are (32/81) / (32/19683) = 19683/81 â‰ˆ 243.
