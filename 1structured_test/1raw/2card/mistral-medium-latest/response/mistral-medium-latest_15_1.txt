To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities. Let's denote the probability of drawing from deck A as P(A) and from deck B as P(B). The probability of drawing a specific combination of cards from deck A is:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, the probability of drawing a specific combination of cards from deck B is:

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the probabilities of drawing the observed combination of cards from deck A and deck B:

posterior odds = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So the posterior odds of drawing from deck A, compared to deck B, are 4:1

{odds: 4}
