To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing from deck A versus deck B.

Let's denote the events:
A: Drawing from deck A
B: Drawing from deck B
X: Drawing a card marked X
O: Drawing a card marked O

We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since one of the decks has been selected by chance).

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO), which can be rewritten using Bayes' theorem as:

[P(XXXO|A) * P(A)] / [P(XXXO|B) * P(B)]

Now let's calculate the likelihoods P(XXXO|A) and P(XXXO|B):

- P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
- P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

So the posterior odds become:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5]

Simplify the expression:

= [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]

= (4/9) / (1/9)

= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
