To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks.

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal (1/2 for each). We'll calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.

Odds = (P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)) = (P(3X and 1O | Deck A) \* P(Deck A)) / (P(3X and 1O | Deck B) \* P(Deck B))

Odds = (8/81 \* 1/2) / (2/81 \* 1/2) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
