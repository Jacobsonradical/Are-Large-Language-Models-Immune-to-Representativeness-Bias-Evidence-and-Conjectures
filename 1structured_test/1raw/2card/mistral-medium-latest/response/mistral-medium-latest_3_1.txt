{odds: 3.27}

Here's the reasoning behind this answer:

1. First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   This can be calculated as (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 0.0972.
2. Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   This can be calculated as (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 0.0137.
3. The posterior odds are the ratio of these two probabilities.
   So, the odds in favor of Deck A are 0.0972 / 0.0137 = 3.27.

Therefore, the answer is {odds: 3.27}.
