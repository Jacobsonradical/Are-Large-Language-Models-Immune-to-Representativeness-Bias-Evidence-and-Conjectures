To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:
odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.

{odds: 4}
