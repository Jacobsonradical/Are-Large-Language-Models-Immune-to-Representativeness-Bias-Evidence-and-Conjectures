To answer this question, we need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Then, we'll find the ratio of these likelihoods to obtain the posterior odds.

1. Calculating likelihood for Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: P(X|A) = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: P(O|A) = 1/3
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the product of their individual probabilities: P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

2. Calculating likelihood for Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: P(X|B) = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: P(O|B) = 2/3
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the product of their individual probabilities: P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

3. Calculating the posterior odds:
   - Posterior odds are the ratio of the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.
     - Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

Calculating the values:

- P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.2963
- P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0278
- Posterior odds = 0.2963 / 0.0278 ≈ 10.6582

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 10.66:1.

{odds: 10.66}
