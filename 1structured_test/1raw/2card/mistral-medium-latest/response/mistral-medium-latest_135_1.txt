To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the posterior odds. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E, the event of selecting Deck A as H1, and the event of selecting Deck B as H2. We want to find the posterior odds P(H1|E)/P(H2|E).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or B, assuming they are equally likely:
P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Since there are 4 cards drawn, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O.

For Deck A:
P(E|H1) = 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(E|H2) = 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 32/243

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) \* P(H1) / [P(E|H1) \* P(H1) + P(E|H2) \* P(H2)]
P(H1|E) ≈ 0.557

P(H2|E) = P(E|H2) \* P(H2) / [P(E|H1) \* P(H1) + P(E|H2) \* P(H2)]
P(H2|E) ≈ 0.443

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(H1|E) / P(H2|E) ≈ 1.258

{odds: 1.258}
