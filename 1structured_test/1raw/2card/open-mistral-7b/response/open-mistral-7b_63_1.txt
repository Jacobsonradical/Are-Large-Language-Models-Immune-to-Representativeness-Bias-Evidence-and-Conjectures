To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let P(X|A) represent the probability of drawing an X card from Deck A, and P(X|B) represent the probability of drawing an X card from Deck B.

The likelihood ratio L is defined as:

L = (P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B))

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | A):

P(3X, 1O | A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)
                      = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                      = (8/27)

Next, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)
                      = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                      = (1/27)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

L = (8/27) / (1/27)
   = 8

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds. Since we don't have prior information, we'll assume equal likelihood of drawing from either deck, so the prior odds are 1:1.

The final answer is:

{odds: 8}

So, given the observed data, the odds are 8 times higher that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, compared to Deck B.
