To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, the probability of drawing a single X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in this order is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = (8/243).

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, the probability of drawing a single X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in this order is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = (1/243).

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (8/243) / (1/243)} = {odds: 8}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 8 times higher than the probability that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
