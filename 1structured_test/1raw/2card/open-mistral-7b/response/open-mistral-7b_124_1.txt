To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the probability of drawing 3 X's multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = P(3X | Deck A) * P(1O | Deck A)
                          = (C(2/3 * 51, 3) / C(52, 4)) * (C(1/3 * 51, 1) / C(52, 1))
                          = (220 / 270,484) * (51 / 52)
                          = 11,000 / 138,608

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the probability of drawing 3 X's multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = P(3X | Deck B) * P(1O | Deck B)
                          = (C(1/3 * 51, 3) / C(52, 4)) * (C(2/3 * 51, 1) / C(52, 1))
                          = (16,800 / 270,484) * (27,200 / 52)
                          = 1,451,500 / 3,260,768

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                     = (11,000 / 138,608) / (1,451,500 / 3,260,768)
                     = 11,000 / 2,518,100
                     â‰ˆ 0.0000439

So, given the information, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 0.000044 to 1 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that it is much more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
