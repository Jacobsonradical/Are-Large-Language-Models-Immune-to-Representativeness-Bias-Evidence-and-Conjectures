To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Let P(3X1O|A) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and P(3X1O|B) be the probability of drawing the same combination from Deck B.

The prior odds are given by the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from each deck:

P(A)/P(B)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (2/9)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = [P(A) * P(3X1O|A)] / [P(B) * P(3X1O|B)]

The probabilities of drawing from each deck are equal because they were chosen randomly, so:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Substitute the probabilities and likelihoods into the equation for the posterior odds:

odds = [(1/2) * (8/27)] / [(1/2) * (2/9)]

odds = (8/27) / (2/27)

odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
