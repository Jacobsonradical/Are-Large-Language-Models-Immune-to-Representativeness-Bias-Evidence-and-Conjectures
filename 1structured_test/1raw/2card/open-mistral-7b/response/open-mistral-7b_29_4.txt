To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:

P(Deck A) = Probability of selecting Deck A
P(Deck B) = 1 - P(Deck A)

Let's assume that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, so:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B:

P(X_3, O_1 | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(X_3, O_1 | Deck B) = (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | X_3, O_1) = P(X_3, O_1 | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(X_3, O_1 | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(X_3, O_1 | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
P(Deck B | X_3, O_1) = P(X_3, O_1 | Deck A) * P(Deck B) / P(X_3, O_1 | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(X_3, O_1 | Deck B) * P(Deck B)

Now, we can find the odds by taking the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

odds = P(Deck A | X_3, O_1) / P(Deck B | X_3, O_1)

Calculating the exact values requires the values of P(Deck A) and P(Deck B), which we assumed to be equal to 1/2. Therefore, the odds are equal to 1. This means that, given the information that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other.

However, it's important to note that this result assumes that the two decks are equally likely to be selected. If we know that one deck is more likely to be selected than the other, the odds would be different.
