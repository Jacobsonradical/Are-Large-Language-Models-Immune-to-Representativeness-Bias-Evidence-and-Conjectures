To find the posterior odds, we need to consider the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and the prior probability of each deck being selected.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X,1O):

1. The probability of drawing a single X from deck A is 2/3.
2. Given that we drew 1 X, there are now 6 X's and 12 O's remaining in the deck, making a total of 18 cards.
3. The probability of drawing 2 more X's is (2/3)*(5/17), and the probability of drawing 1 O is (12/17)*(1/16).
4. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in that order is (2/3)*(5/17)*(12/17)*(1/16) = P(X,X,X,O|A).

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X,1O):

1. The probability of drawing a single X from deck B is 1/3.
2. Given that we drew 1 X, there are now 6 X's and 18 O's remaining in the deck, making a total of 24 cards.
3. The probability of drawing 2 more X's is (1/3)*(5/23), and the probability of drawing 1 O is (18/23)*(1/24).
4. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in that order is (1/3)*(5/23)*(18/23)*(1/24) = P(X,X,X,O|B).

Now, we calculate the prior probabilities of each deck being selected:

1. Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior probability of deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of deck B is also 1/2.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(X,X,X,O|A)) / (P(X,X,X,O|B)) * (1/2) / (1/2)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated, we get:

odds = [(2/3)*(5/17)*(12/17)*(1/16)] / [(1/3)*(5/23)*(18/23)*(1/24)] * (1/2) / (1/2)

Calculate the numerator and denominator, and you will get the final odds.
