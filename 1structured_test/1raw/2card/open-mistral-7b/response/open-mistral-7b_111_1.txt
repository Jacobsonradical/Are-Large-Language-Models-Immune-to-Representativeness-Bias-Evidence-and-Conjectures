To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's drawn from Deck A as O_A. Similarly, let X_B and O_B represent the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Posterior odds = {P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
                     = {P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)}
                     = {[C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] * (2/3) / [C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)] * (1/3)}
                     = {(2/3)^4} / {(1/3)^4}
                     = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 8 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
