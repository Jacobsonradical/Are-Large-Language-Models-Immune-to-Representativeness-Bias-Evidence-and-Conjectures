To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Then, we have:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Now, let's find the prior probabilities:

P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratios:

L(A|data) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (8/27) = 1
L(B|data) = P(3X, 1O | B) / P(3X, 1O | A) = (8/27) / (8/27) = 1

Since both likelihood ratios are equal to 1, they do not provide any information to help distinguish between Deck A and Deck B. Therefore, the posterior odds remain the same as the prior odds:

{odds: 1}

In other words, based on this data, we cannot determine with certainty whether the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B.
