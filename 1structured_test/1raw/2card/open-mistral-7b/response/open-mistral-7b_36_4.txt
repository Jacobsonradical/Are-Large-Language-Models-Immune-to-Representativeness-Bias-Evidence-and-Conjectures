To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X_A and 1O_A | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                             = 220 * (1/81)
                             = 22/81

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X_B and 1O_B | B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1
                             = 1008 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                             = 1008 * (1/81) * (2/9)
                             = 200 * (2/81)
                             = 200/81

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:
L = P(3X_A and 1O_A | A) / P(3X_B and 1O_B | B) = (22/81) / (200/81) = 22/165

Now, calculate the prior odds:
P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = L * Prior odds = (22/165) * 2 = 44/165

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 44 to 165.
