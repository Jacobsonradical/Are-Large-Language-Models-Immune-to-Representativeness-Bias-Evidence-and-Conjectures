To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

Let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(3X,1O | Deck A) = C(6,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
   = 20 * (1/27) * (1/3)
   = 2/81

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(3X,1O | Deck B) = C(9,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
   = 84 * (1/27) * (2/9)
   = 8/27

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X,1O) = P(3X,1O | Deck A) / P(3X,1O | Deck B)}
{odds: = (2/81) / (8/27)}
{odds: = 1/12}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/12 compared to Deck B.
