To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide the probabilities.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of taking k items from a set of n items.

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

To find the posterior odds, we'll divide the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B))

Calculate the values and simplify the expression to find the posterior odds.
