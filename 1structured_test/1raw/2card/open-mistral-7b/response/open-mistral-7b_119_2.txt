To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

For Deck A:
P(XXXO | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/216

For Deck B:
P(XXXO | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now let's find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:
P(Deck A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen)
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(Deck A | XXXO)) / (P(Deck B | XXXO))

Let's find the probabilities:
P(Deck A | XXXO) = P(XXXO | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(XXXO | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(XXXO | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

Calculating the numerator:
P(Deck A | XXXO) = (8/216) * (1/2) / [(8/216) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2)]

Calculating the denominator:
P(Deck A | XXXO) = (8/216) * (1/2) / [(8/216) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression:
P(Deck A | XXXO) ≈ 0.2484

Now let's find P(Deck B | XXXO):
P(Deck B | XXXO) = P(XXXO | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / [P(XXXO | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(XXXO | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

Calculating the numerator:
P(Deck B | XXXO) = (2/243) * (1/2) / [(8/216) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2)]

Calculating the denominator:
P(Deck B | XXXO) = (2/243) * (1/2) / [(8/216) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression:
P(Deck B | XXXO) ≈ 0.0456

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(Deck A | XXXO) / P(Deck B | XXXO) ≈ 5.42

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is approximately 5.42 times greater than the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards.
