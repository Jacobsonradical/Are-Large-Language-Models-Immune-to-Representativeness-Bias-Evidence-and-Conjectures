To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X and the number of O's drawn from Deck A as O. We know that X + O = 4.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(X = 3) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
              = 4 * (1/27) * (1/3)
              = 4/81

Similarly, for Deck B:

P(X = 3) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
              = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
              = 8/81

Now we have the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks. We can find the posterior odds by dividing these probabilities:

Posterior Odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                         = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B))
                         = (P(3X, 1O)) / (P(3X, 1O) * (Deck B probability) / (Deck A probability))

Now, since we have calculated P(3X, 1O) for both Decks A and B, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = (4/81) / (8/81) = 1

The posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1, which means that there is no evidence favoring either deck, given the observed data.
