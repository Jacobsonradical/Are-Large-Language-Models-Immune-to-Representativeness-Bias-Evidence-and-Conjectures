To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's drawn from Deck A as O_A. Similarly, let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck B as X_B and the number of O's drawn from Deck B as O_B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X_A = 3, O_A = 1 | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X_B = 3, O_B = 1 | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1

Now, if Deck A was selected, the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O is P(X_A = 3, O_A = 1 | Deck A). If Deck B was selected, the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O is P(X_B = 3, O_B = 1 | Deck B).

The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1.

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of the likelihoods:

odds = P(X_A = 3, O_A = 1 | Deck A) / P(X_B = 3, O_B = 1 | Deck B)

Plugging in the values for the probabilities, we get:

odds = ((2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1) / ((1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1)

Simplifying the expression, we find that the posterior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 2}

This means that, given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O, it is twice as likely (or two times more probable) that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
