To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's determine the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                         = 220 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 12 * (1/9)
                         = 220 * (2/81)
                         = 160 / 81

Next, let's determine the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                         = 1140 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 18 * (1/9)
                         = 1140 * (2/81)
                         = 248 / 81

Now, we can calculate the odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
====================================================

We can simplify this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities:

{odds: P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)}

Given that P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = 160 / 81 and P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 248 / 81, the odds are:

{odds: 160 / 248}

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

{odds: 4 / 7}

So the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 4 to 7 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
