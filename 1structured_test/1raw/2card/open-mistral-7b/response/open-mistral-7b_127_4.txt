To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                     = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                     = 220 * 1/81
                                     ≈ 0.0282

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                     = 204 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                     = 204 * 2/81
                                     ≈ 0.0506

Now, let's find the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probability of drawing from Deck A to the probability of drawing from Deck B:

P(Deck A) = (2/3) * (12!) / (15!)
                  = 8/15

P(Deck B) = (1/3) * (18!) / (15!)
                = 2/15

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 8/15 / 2/15 = 4/1

Finally, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A)) / (P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B)) * (P(Deck A) / P(Deck B))
                         ≈ (0.0282) / (0.0506) * (4/1)
                         ≈ 0.282 / 0.506 * 4
                         ≈ 0.759

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.759, meaning it's about 3 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
