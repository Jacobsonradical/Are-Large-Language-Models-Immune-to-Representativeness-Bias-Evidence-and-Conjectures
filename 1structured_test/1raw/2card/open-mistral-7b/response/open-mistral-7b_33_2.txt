To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B, given that we drew 4 cards with these characteristics.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1

Now, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(B | 3X, 1O)]

= [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

= [(C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1) * (1/2)] / [(C(18, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1) * (1/2)]

= (C(12, 3) * (2/3)) / (C(18, 3) * (1/3))

= (220) / (1530)

= 0.1444

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.1444, meaning that Deck B is about 6.87 times more likely than Deck A given the observed data. However, since the prior odds were equal, this result indicates a slight preference for Deck B.
