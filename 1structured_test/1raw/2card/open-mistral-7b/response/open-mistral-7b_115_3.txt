To find the posterior odds, we need to first calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
Probability of drawing the first X = 2/3
Probability of drawing the second X = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3
Probability of drawing the third X = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6
Probability of drawing the first O = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/6) * (2/9) = 1/162

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
Probability of drawing the first X = 1/3
Probability of drawing the second X = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9
Probability of drawing the third X = (2/9) * (2/3) = 4/27
Probability of drawing the first O = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3) * (2/9) * (4/27) * (2/9) = 1/1089

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A * Prior odds / Likelihood of Deck B

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being chosen, which is (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So, the posterior odds = (1/162) * (2) / (1/1089) = 1/845

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.00118 or 1 to 845. In other words, it is more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
