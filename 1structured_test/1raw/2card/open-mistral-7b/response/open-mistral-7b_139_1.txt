To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio between the two hypotheses (Deck A and Deck B) given the observed data (drawing 3 X's and 1 O).

Let's denote:
- P(X|A) as the probability of drawing an X from Deck A
- P(X|B) as the probability of drawing an X from Deck B
- P(O|A) as the probability of drawing an O from Deck A
- P(O|B) as the probability of drawing an O from Deck B

Given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we have:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

Similarly, given that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we have:
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio LR = P(3X and 1O|A) / P(3X and 1O|B):

First, let's find P(3X and 1O|A):
P(3X and 1O|A) = P(X)[P(X|X X X)(P(O|X)) + P(X X)(P(X|X O))P(O|X) + P(X)(P(X|X X O))P(O|X)P(O|X)]
                        = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2) + (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2) + (2/3) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)^2
                        = (2/3)^3 * (1/2) + (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2) + (2/3) * (2/3)^2 * (1/2)^2

Now, let's find P(3X and 1O|B):
P(3X and 1O|B) = P(X)[P(X|X X X)(P(O|X)) + P(X X)(P(X|X O))P(O|X) + P(X)(P(X|X X O))P(O|X)P(O|X)]
                        = (1/3)^3 * (1/2) + (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2) + (1/3) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)^2
                        = (1/3)^3 * (1/2) + (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2) + (1/3) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)^2

Since P(3X and 1O|A) = P(3X and 1O|B), the likelihood ratio LR is equal to 1.

However, the question asks for the odds, which is the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds. The prior odds in this case are P(A) / P(B), where P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B respectively.

Since we don't have any information about the prior probabilities, we can't provide a specific number for the odds. We would need additional information to calculate the prior odds and obtain the final odds.
