To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities:

P(A) = Number of ways to choose 12 cards with 8 X's / Total number of ways to choose 12 cards from 24
P(B) = Number of ways to choose 18 cards with 6 X's / Total number of ways to choose 18 cards from 36

To find the posterior odds, we apply Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

First, let's find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Now, let's find the prior odds:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Finally, multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds to get the posterior odds:

{odds: your answer as a single number} = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

Please note that the exact numerical calculation requires knowledge of the total number of ways to choose a specific number of X's from a larger set, which is a combinatorics problem. The formula for calculating this is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of cards and k is the number of X's in the chosen subset.

Therefore, the answer cannot be given as a single number without knowing the total number of cards in each deck.
