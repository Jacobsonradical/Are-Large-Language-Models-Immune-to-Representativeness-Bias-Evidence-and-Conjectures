To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck.

In Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 35 * (1/27) + 20 * (1/27)
                          = 0.632 (approximately)

In Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(5, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
                          = 20 * (1/27) + 10 * (1/27) * (4/9)
                          = 0.364 (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 0.632 / 0.364
     = 1.737 (approximately)

Since the prior odds of drawing from Deck A over Deck B are equal (1), the posterior odds are simply the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 1.737}
