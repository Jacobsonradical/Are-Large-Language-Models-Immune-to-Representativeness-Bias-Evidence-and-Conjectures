To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                          = (220) * (1/27) * (1) * (24) * (1/9) * (2/3)
                          = 220 * (2/27)
                          = 8 * (2/9)
                          = 32/27

Now let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                          = (1530) * (1/27) * (2/3) * (36) * (1/9) * (1/3)
                          = 1530 * (2/27) * (1/3)
                          = 10 * (2/9)
                          = 20/27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = 32/27 / 20/27
      = 32/20

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 32/20.
