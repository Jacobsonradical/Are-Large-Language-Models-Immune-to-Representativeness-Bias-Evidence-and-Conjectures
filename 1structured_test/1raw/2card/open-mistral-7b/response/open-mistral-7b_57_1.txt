To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed data.

Let P(X|A) and P(X|B) represent the probabilities of drawing an X from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Similarly, let P(O|A) and P(O|B) represent the probabilities of drawing an O from Deck A and Deck B.

Given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, we have:

P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

Similarly, given that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O, we have:

P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

Now, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O given that we've drawn 4 cards from each deck:

P(3X 1O|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X 1O|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

C(n,k) represents the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X 1O|A) / P(3X 1O|B)

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

LR = (C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplifying the expression, we find that LR = 1.

Since the likelihood ratio is equal to 1, the posterior odds are also equal to 1. This means that, given the observed data, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A over Deck B, or vice versa.

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 1}

This result may seem counterintuitive, but it reflects the fact that the observed data is not sufficiently informative to distinguish between Deck A and Deck B based on the given information.
