To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
                             = (8/27) * (1/3)
                             = 8/81

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                             = (1/27) * (2/3)
                             = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
                         = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)] / [P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)]
                         = [(8/81) / (2/81)] / [(2/3) / (1/3)]
                         = 4/1

So, the posterior odds are 4 to 1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
