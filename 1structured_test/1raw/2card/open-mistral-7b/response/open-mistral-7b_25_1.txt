To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(18, 4)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(12, 4)

The probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck A is 2/3, and from Deck B is 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

You can calculate the exact values of the probabilities and odds using the given formulas and combinatorial calculations. After calculating, you'll find that the posterior odds favor Deck A.
