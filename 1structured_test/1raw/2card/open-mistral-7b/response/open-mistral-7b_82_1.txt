To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide the likelihood of Deck A by the likelihood of Deck B.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's in the drawn cards as X and O respectively. We have X = 3 and O = 1.

Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X=3, O=1 | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12,3) * C(12,1)

where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X=3, O=1 | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12,3) * C(12,1)

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(X=3, O=1 | Deck A) / P(X=3, O=1 | Deck B)

After calculating, we get:

LR = 2^3 * C(12,3) * C(12,1) / (3^3 * C(12,3) * C(12,1))

Since C(12,3) * C(12,1) is constant for both decks, we can simplify LR to:

LR = 8 * 2 / 27

LR = 32/27

So the posterior odds are:

{odds: 32/27}

This means that, given the observed data, the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is 32 times more likely than being drawn from Deck B.
