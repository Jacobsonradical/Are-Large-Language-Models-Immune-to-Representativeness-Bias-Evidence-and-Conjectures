To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities first:

1. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 51, 3) * C(1/3 * 51, 1) / C(51, 4)
   where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.

2. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)}
