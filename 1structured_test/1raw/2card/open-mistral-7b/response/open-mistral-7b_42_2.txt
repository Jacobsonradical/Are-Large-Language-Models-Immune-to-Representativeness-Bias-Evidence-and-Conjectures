To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X,1O):
The probability of drawing 3X from a deck of 2/3 X cards is C(2/3)^3 * C(1/3)^1 = 0.267
The probability of drawing 1O from a deck of 1/3 O cards is C(1/3)^1 * C(2/3)^3 = 0.196
So, P(A|3X,1O) = 0.267 * 0.196 = 0.052

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X,1O):
The probability of drawing 3X from a deck of 1/3 X cards is C(1/3)^3 * C(2/3)^1 = 0.024
The probability of drawing 1O from a deck of 2/3 O cards is C(2/3)^1 * C(1/3)^3 = 0.243
So, P(B|3X,1O) = 0.024 * 0.243 = 0.0058

Now, we can calculate the odds:
odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = 0.052 / 0.0058 = 8.97

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 9 to 1.
