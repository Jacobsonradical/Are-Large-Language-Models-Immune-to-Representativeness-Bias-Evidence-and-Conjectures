To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B, given that we drew 4 cards with these specific marks.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

1. Deck A: (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 1!) * (1/3) = 2/27
2. Deck B: (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 1!) / (3! * 2!) * (2/3) = 2/27

We can see that the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from both decks are equal. However, since we drew the cards at random, the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is not relevant. Therefore, the posterior odds are also 1:1, meaning there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other based on this information.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 1}
