To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) in Deck A to Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9
                         = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 220 * (1/81)
                         = 220 * (1/81) * (220/81)
                         = 1/3 * (220/81)^2

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^15
                         = 1530 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 18 * (2/3) * (1/81)
                         = 1530 * (1/81) * (18/81)
                         = 1/3 * (18/81)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = (1/3 * (220/81)^2) / (1/3 * (18/81))
    = (220/81)^2 / 18

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: (220/81)^2 / 18}

Or, approximately:

{odds: 11.97}

Answer: The observation is about 12 times more likely in Deck A than in Deck B.
