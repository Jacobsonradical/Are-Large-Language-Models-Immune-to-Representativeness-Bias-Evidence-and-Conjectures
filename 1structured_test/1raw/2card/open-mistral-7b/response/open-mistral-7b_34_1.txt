To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A is calculated as follows:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/C(12,4))

Where C(12,4) is the number of combinations of choosing 4 cards out of 12, which is calculated as 12! / (4!(12-4)!) = 495

So, P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/495)

The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B is calculated as follows:
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/C(12,4))

So, P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/495)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/495)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/495)]

odds = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3

odds = 8/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8 to 1.
