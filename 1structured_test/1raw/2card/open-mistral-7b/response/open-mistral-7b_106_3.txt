To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):
Since in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 2/3 of the X-marked cards, times the probability of drawing 1 O from the 1/3 of the O-marked cards.

So, P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 1/21

Next, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):
Since in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 1/3 of the X-marked cards, times the probability of drawing 1 O from the 2/3 of the O-marked cards.

So, P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 1/6

Now, let's calculate the prior odds:
The prior odds are the odds that the deck is Deck A before any cards are drawn. Since there are twice as many X-marked cards in Deck A as in Deck B, the prior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A.

So, the prior odds are P(A) / P(B) = 2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

odds = (1/21 * 2) / (1/6 * 1)

odds = 1/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/3 in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B.
