To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent Deck A and B represent Deck B.

P(A) represents the prior probability of Deck A being chosen, P(B) represents the prior probability of Deck B being chosen.

P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) represents the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B) represents the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being chosen)
P(X | A) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
P(O | A) = 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)

P(B) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being chosen)
P(X | B) = 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
P(O | B) = 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)

Now, we can calculate the probabilities P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) and P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B):

P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) = P(X_1 | A) * P(X_2 | X_1, A) * P(X_3 | X_1, X_2, A) * P(O | X_1, X_2, X_3, A)
                                      = (2/3) * (2/2) * (2/1) * (1/2)
                                      = 8/64
                                      = 1/8

P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B) = P(X_1 | B) * P(X_2 | X_1, B) * P(X_3 | X_1, X_2, B) * P(O | X_1, X_2, X_3, B)
                                      = (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/1) * (1/3)
                                      = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | X_1, X_2, X_3, O) / P(B | X_1, X_2, X_3, O)
                         = P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) / P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B)
                         = (1/8) / (1/27)
                         = 1/27 / 1/8
                         = 8/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8/27. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is approximately 8/27 times more likely to have been the source of the cards compared to Deck B.
