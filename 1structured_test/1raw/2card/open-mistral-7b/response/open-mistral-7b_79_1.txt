To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = 2/27

Now, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in total, which can happen from either deck. This probability is the sum of the probabilities from both decks:
P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

We are given that the observed event happens, so we can set P(3X, 1O) = 1. Solving for P(A) and P(B), we get:

P(A) = (2/27) / [(2/27) * P(A) + (2/27) * P(B)]
P(B) = (1/27) / [(2/27) * P(A) + (2/27) * P(B)]

Since we have two equations and three variables, we cannot find exact values for P(A) and P(B). However, we can find the ratio of their probabilities, which is what we need for the odds.

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(A) * P(3X, 1O | A)] / [P(B) * P(3X, 1O | B)]

Since we cannot find exact values for P(A) and P(B), we cannot provide a numerical answer for the odds. However, we can conclude that the odds favor Deck A over Deck B, as there is a higher probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A than from Deck B, given that Deck A has a higher proportion of X-marked cards.
