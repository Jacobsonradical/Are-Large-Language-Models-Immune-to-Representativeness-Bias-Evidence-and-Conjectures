To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck. Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O)

P(3X, 1O|A) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A. Since there are 4 cards drawn, we can calculate this probability using combinations:

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(2/3 * 36, 3) * C(1/3 * 36, 1) / C(36, 4)

Similarly, P(3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O regardless of which deck it's from:

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

Since we don't have information about the size of the decks, we cannot directly calculate P(A) and P(B), but we can assume that they are equal, and we'll find the ratio of the posterior odds.

For Deck B:
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) / P(3X, 1O)

Calculate P(3X, 1O|B) in a similar way as above:

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(1/3 * 36, 3) * C(2/3 * 36, 1) / C(36, 4)

Now, we can find the ratio of the posterior odds. Since P(A) and P(B) are equal, we can rewrite the posterior odds as:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) / P(3X, 1O))

Simplify the expression:

odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(B)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(A))

Since P(A) = P(B), the odds are equal to the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck. However, without the size of the decks, we cannot calculate the actual values of P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), thus we cannot provide a numerical answer for the odds.
