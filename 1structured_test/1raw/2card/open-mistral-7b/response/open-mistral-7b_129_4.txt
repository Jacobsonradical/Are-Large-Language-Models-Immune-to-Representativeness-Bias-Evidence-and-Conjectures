To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of the observed event (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) given each deck. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|obs) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|obs).

P(A|obs) = P(obs|A) * P(A) = (C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) * ((2/3)) = (8/6*27*1/6) * (2/3) = 8/27

P(B|obs) = P(obs|B) * P(B) = (C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) * ((1/3)) = (8/6*1*2/6) * (1/3) = 8/36

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|obs) / P(B|obs) = (8/27) / (8/36) = 8/27 * 36/8 = 36/27

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) is 36/27.
