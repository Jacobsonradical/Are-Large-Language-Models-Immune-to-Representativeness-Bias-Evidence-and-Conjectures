To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (A) is:
P(3X 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
             = 35 * (1/27)
             = 125/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (B) is:
P(3X 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
             = 20 * (1/27)
             = 20/27

Now, let's find P(A) and P(B).

P(A) = P(drawing Deck A) = 1
P(B) = P(drawing Deck B) = 1

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X 1O) = P(3X 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X 1O | B) * P(B)]
            = (125/27) / [(125/27) + (20/27)]
            = 625/696

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:
{odds: 625/696}

Note that the final answer is a ratio, and we can simplify it by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 25):

{odds: 25/27}

This means that, considering the drawing of 3 X's and 1 O, the probability of the deck being Deck A is 25/27 times the probability of it being Deck B.
