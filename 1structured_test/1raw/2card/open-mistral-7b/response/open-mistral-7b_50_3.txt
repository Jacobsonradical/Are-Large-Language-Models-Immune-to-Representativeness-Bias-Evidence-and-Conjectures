To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities for each deck:

Deck A:
P(X) = Number of X-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 2/3

P(O) = Number of O-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 1/3

P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
          = 220 * (1/27)
          = 8 * 1/3

Deck B:
P(X) = Number of X-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 1/3

P(O) = Number of O-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 2/3

P(3X, 1O) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
          = 1080 * (1/27)
          = 40 * 1/3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)
     = (8 * 1/3) / (40 * 1/3) * (2/3) / (1/3)
     = 2/5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2/5.
