To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let L(A) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and L(B) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
        = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
        = 220/243

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
        = 220 * (1/27) * (2/3)
        = 440/27

Now, the prior odds are the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes for Deck A to the number of favorable outcomes for Deck B before drawing the cards. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume that the prior odds are 1:1, or 1.

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio of the two decks:

{odds: L(A) / L(B)}
{odds: 220/243 / 440/27}
{odds: 220/243 * 27/440}
{odds: 220/887}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.247 or 1/4.12 to 1.
