To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability that the deck is A and P(B) be the probability that the deck is B.

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A (A):
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
              = 35 * (1/27)
              = 1/3

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B (B):
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
              = 20 * (1/27)
              = 2/9

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Number of ways to choose 2/3 cards marked X from A / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A
     = C(26, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 / C(52, 4)
     = 15 * (4/81)
     = 10/27

P(B) = Number of ways to choose 1/3 cards marked X from B / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B
     = C(39, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)
     = 4860 * (1/27) * (2/13)
     = 960 / 1001

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of Deck A:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
              = (1/3) * (10/27) / [(1/3) * (10/27) + (2/9) * (960 / 1001)]
              = (10/81) / [(10/81) + (192/900)]
              = (10/81) / (192/900 + 10/81)
              = (10/81) / (192/900 + 10/81)
              = (10/81) / (1212/900)
              = 10/1212

Now, to find the odds, divide the posterior probability of Deck A by the posterior probability of Deck B:

{odds: 10/1212 / 960/1001 = 10/1212 / 96}

The final answer is the ratio of these two fractions: 10/1212 divided by 96.
