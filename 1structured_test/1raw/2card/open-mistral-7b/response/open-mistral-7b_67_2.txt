To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                              = 220 * (1/27)
                              = 8 * 1/3
                              = 8/27

Similarly, in Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                              = 1530 * (1/27)
                              = 54 * 1/3
                              = 18

The prior probability of drawing Deck A is given by the probability of selecting Deck A from the two decks, which is assumed to be equal for both decks:

P(Deck A) = 1/2

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
      = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(18) * (1/2)]
      = 4/27 / 9
      = 2/81

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2/81.
