To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (4 drawn) with 8 X's and 4 O's is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(8, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(12, 4)

Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (4 drawn) with 4 X's and 8 O's is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(12, 4)

Now, calculate the odds:

odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Using the binomial coefficients and the probabilities calculated above, we get:

odds ≈ 2120 / 128

Simplifying, we get:

odds ≈ 16.5

So, the posterior odds are approximately 16.5 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
