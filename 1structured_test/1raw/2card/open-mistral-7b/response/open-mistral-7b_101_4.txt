To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3) * C(18, 1) * (1/3)² * (2/3) = 220 * (1/27) * (1/9) * 18 * (2/9) = 220 * (1/162) = 1/8

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)² * (2/3) = 1587 * (1/27) * (1/9) * 12 * (2/9) = 1587 * (1/162) = 10

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 220 / 10 = 22}

So, given the information that 4 cards were drawn with 3X and 1O, the odds are approximately 22 times more that they came from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) than Deck B (where most cards are marked O).
