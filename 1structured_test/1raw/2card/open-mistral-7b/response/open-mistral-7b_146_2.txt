To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote A as the event that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that they are drawn from Deck B.

P(A) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
P(B) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

P(A) = (2/3)C(12, 3) * (1/3)C(12, 1) = (2/3) * (220) * (1/3) = 22/27
P(B) = (1/3)C(16, 3) * (2/3)C(16, 1) = (1/3) * (280) * (2/3) = 28/81

Now, let's assume that we started with equal prior odds, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1. Then, the posterior odds would be:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) * P(B)
                            = [(2/3)C(12, 3) * (1/3)C(12, 1)] / [(1/3)C(16, 3) * (2/3)C(16, 1)]
                            * [(22/27)] / [(28/81)]
                            = (112/27) / (16/81)
                            = 112/16 * 81/27
                            = 732/162

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B is 732/162.
