To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                       = 35/243

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                       = 20/81

Now, let's find the prior probability of each deck:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be selected)
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

First, find P(A | 3X, 1O):
P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
                      = (35/243) * (1/2) / [(35/243) * (1/2) + (20/81) * (1/2)]
                      ≈ 0.5327

Now, find P(B | 3X, 1O):
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
                      = (20/81) * (1/2) / [(35/243) * (1/2) + (20/81) * (1/2)]
                      ≈ 0.4673

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 0.5327 / 0.4673 ≈ 1.143}

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.143 times higher than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B to be the source of the drawn cards.
