To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X,1O).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (4 marked X and 8 marked O):

P(A|4X,1O) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 8 cards (3 marked X and 5 marked O):

P(B|4X,1O) = C(8,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's define the prior probability of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, denoted as P(A) and P(B), respectively. Since they are equally likely, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O)} = {[C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [C(8,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]} / 0.5

Calculating the combinations and probabilities, we get:

{odds: 7 / 3} (approximately 2.33)

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 2.33 times higher than from Deck B.
