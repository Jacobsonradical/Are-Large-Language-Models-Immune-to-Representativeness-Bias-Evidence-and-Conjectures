To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then compare the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O):

1. There are C(13, 3) ways to choose 3X cards from 13X cards in Deck A, and C(13, 1) ways to choose 1O card from 1O card in Deck A.
2. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for Deck A is C(13, 3) * C(1, 1) = 128.
3. The total number of possible outcomes for Deck A is C(26, 4).
4. Therefore, P(A|3X, 1O) = 128 / C(26, 4).

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O):

1. There are C(10, 3) ways to choose 3X cards from 10X cards in Deck B, and C(13, 1) ways to choose 1O card from 13O cards in Deck B.
2. So, the total number of favorable outcomes for Deck B is C(10, 3) * C(13, 1) = 1280.
3. The total number of possible outcomes for Deck B is C(26, 4).
4. Therefore, P(B|3X, 1O) = 1280 / C(26, 4).

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

By calculating the above expression, we find that the posterior odds are approximately 10.47 in favor of Deck A.

So, the answer is: {odds: 10.47}

This means that, given the observed 3X and 1O cards, it is approximately 10.47 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
