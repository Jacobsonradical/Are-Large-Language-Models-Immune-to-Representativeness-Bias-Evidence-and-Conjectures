To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, and then the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Prior Probability of Deck A (P(A)): Since the decks were selected randomly, the probability of choosing Deck A is the same as Deck B, which is 1/2.

Prior Probability of Deck B (P(B)): P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O if the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A:

Likelihood of Deck A (L(A)): Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X and 1/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = (1/4).

Likelihood of Deck B (L(B)): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 1/4.

Since both L(A) and L(B) are equal to 1/4, the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds:

Posterior Odds (P(A|data) / P(B|data)): The data does not provide any information to favor one deck over the other, so the posterior odds remain equal to the prior odds:

{odds: 1}

However, it's important to note that while the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the same for both decks, the overall probabilities of picking a card marked X or O from each deck are different, as explained in the question. This means that while the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the same, the decks themselves are not equally likely to have been chosen.
