To find the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A over Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) given each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(3, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(3, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
                     = 0.024 + 0.048 + 0.048 ≈ 0.12

Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(3, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^0
                     = (1/27) * (2/3) + (6/81) * (4/9) + (1/81) * 1 ≈ 0.04

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 3.0

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

odds = L * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)

Let's assume that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, so P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2. Then,

odds = 3.0 * (1/2) / (1/2) = 3.0

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 3.0 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
