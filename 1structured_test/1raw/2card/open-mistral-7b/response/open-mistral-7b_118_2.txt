To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of event A given some observed data (in this case, drawing 3 X's and 1 O) is given by:

P(A|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B)]

First, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(A) is the probability that Deck A was selected, which is 1/2 because the selection is random.
2. P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1/2
3. P(X|A) is the probability of drawing an X from Deck A, which is 2/3.
4. P(O|A) is the probability of drawing an O from Deck A, which is 1/3.
5. P(X|B) is the probability of drawing an X from Deck B, which is 1/3.
6. P(O|B) is the probability of drawing an O from Deck B, which is 2/3.
7. P(3X, 1O|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which can be calculated as (C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) * (C(26, 1) * (1/3)) = 35/196.
8. P(3X, 1O|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which can be calculated as (C(26, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) * (C(52, 1) * (1/3)) = 35/112.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)] = [(35/196) * (1/2)] / [(35/112) * (1/2)]

Simplify the terms:

odds = [35/384] / [35/224]

odds = 35/384 / 35/224 = 35/384 / 280/384 = 35/280 / 280/384 = 35/280 / 2 = 35/560 = 7/112

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X's, is 7/112 compared to Deck B, the deck with more O's.
