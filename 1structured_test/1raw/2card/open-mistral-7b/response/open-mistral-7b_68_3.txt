To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(B | 3X, 1O) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)}

To calculate the exact values, you can substitute the values in the binomial coefficients and exponentiate the probabilities. If you don't have a calculator that can handle binomial coefficients directly, you can use the formula for C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) and calculate the factorials.
