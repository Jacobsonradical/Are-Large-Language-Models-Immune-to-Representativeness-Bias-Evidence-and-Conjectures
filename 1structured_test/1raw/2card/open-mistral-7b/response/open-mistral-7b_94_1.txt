To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using combinations:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(A) = Number of ways to choose Deck A / Total number of decks
P(B) = 1 - P(A)

The total number of decks is the sum of the number of ways to choose Deck A and the number of ways to choose Deck B: Total = C(30, 2)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(A) * P(3X, 1O | A)] / [P(B) * P(3X, 1O | B)]

After calculating the values, the odds are:
