To find the posterior odds, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the deck is A as A and the event that the deck is B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, given that the deck is either A or B, is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
           = 220 * (1/27)
           = 8

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that the deck is either A or B, is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
           = 1287

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Number of decks with most X's / Total number of decks
     = 2 / (2 + 1)
     = 2/3

P(B) = 1 - P(A)
     = 1/3

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
             = (8 * 2/3) / [(8 * 2/3) + (1287 * 1/3)]
             ≈ 0.01516

P(B | 3X, 1O) = 1 - P(A | 3X, 1O)
             ≈ 0.98484

Now, we can find the odds:
Odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
     ≈ 0.01516 / 0.98484
     ≈ 0.0153

So the answer is: {odds: 0.0153} or approximately 1 in 64. The 4 cards are about 1.53 times more likely to have been drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
