To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them by the prior probabilities of each deck.

Let's calculate the likelihood first:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                          = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                          = 8/243

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                          = 1530 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                          = 8/3

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds:

posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                        = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                        = (8/243) * (1/2) / [(8/3) * (1/2)]
                        = 8/546

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8/546.
