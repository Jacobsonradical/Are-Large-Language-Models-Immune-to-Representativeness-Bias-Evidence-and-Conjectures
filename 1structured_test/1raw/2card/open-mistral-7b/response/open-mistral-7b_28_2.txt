To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let L(A) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and L(B) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The probability of drawing a single X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)

The probability of drawing a single X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = L(A) / L(B) = [(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)] / [(1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)]

Simplifying the fractions, we get:

odds = 8/27 / 1/27 = 8 / 1 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 8 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
