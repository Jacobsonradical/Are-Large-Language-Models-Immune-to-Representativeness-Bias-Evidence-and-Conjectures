To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

1. Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck A: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck A: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

2. Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck B: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck B: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A] / [Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B]

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Posterior odds = [2/27] / [1/27]

Posterior odds = 2

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 2 times higher than the odds of drawing those 4 cards from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
