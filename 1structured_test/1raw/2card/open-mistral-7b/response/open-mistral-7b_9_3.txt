To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability of drawing cards from Deck A
P(B) as the probability of drawing cards from Deck B

Given that 4 cards are drawn with 3 X's and 1 O, the likelihood of drawing them from Deck A, P(A|3X, 1O), can be calculated as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards) / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is given by the binomial coefficient C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A is given by the binomial coefficient C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, P(B|3X, 1O), can be calculated as follows:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards) / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is still C(4, 3) = 4

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

To find the actual number, multiply the likelihoods and divide by the prior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since we are only given the proportions of X and O cards in each deck, we cannot calculate the actual number of cards in each deck, so we cannot calculate the prior odds directly. However, we can express the prior odds as a ratio of the proportions of X cards in each deck:

P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds is:

Posterior odds = [P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)] * (2)

To calculate this, you would need to know the exact values of the binomial coefficients and the total number of cards in each deck, which are not given in the problem statement.
