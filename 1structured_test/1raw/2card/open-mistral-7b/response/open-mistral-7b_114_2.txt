To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A as P(X|A), and the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B as P(X|B).

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(X X X O | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(X X X O | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B:

odds = P(A|X X X O) / P(B|X X X O)

To find P(A|X X X O) and P(B|X X X O), we can use Bayes' theorem.

P(A|X X X O) = P(X X X O | A) * P(A) / [P(X X X O | A) * P(A) + P(X X X O | B) * P(B)]

P(B|X X X O) = P(X X X O | B) * P(B) / [P(X X X O | A) * P(A) + P(X X X O | B) * P(B)]

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since both decks are equally likely to be selected.

Therefore, we only need to calculate:

P(X X X O | A) / P(X X X O | B)

We calculated the probabilities earlier:

P(X X X O | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)
P(X X X O | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

So, the odds are:

odds = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) / (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Simplifying the fractions, we get:

odds = 8/81 / 1/27

odds = 8/1

The final answer is:
{odds: 8}

So, based on the drawn cards, the odds are 8 to 1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
