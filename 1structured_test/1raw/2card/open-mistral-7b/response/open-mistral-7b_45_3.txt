To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, and then the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards given each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B).

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O given each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)

The number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the binomial coefficient:
C(2/3 * 51, 3) * C(1/3 * 51, 1)

The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A is given by the binomial coefficient:
C(51, 4)

So, P(3X, 1O | A) = (C(2/3 * 51, 3) * C(1/3 * 51, 1)) / C(51, 4)

Similarly, we can calculate P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | B) = (Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)

The number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by the binomial coefficient:
C(1/3 * 51, 3) * C(2/3 * 51, 1)

The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B is given by the binomial coefficient:
C(51, 4)

So, P(3X, 1O | B) = (C(1/3 * 51, 3) * C(2/3 * 51, 1)) / C(51, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

= P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

= [(C(2/3 * 51, 3) * C(1/3 * 51, 1)) / C(51, 4)] * (1) / [[(C(1/3 * 51, 3) * C(2/3 * 51, 1)) / C(51, 4)] * (1)]

= (C(2/3 * 51, 3) * C(1/3 * 51, 1)) / (C(1/3 * 51, 3) * C(2/3 * 51, 1))

= (2/3 * 51 choose 3) * (1/3 * 51 choose 1) / ((1/3 * 51 choose 3) * (2/3 * 51 choose 1))

= (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (51 choose 3) / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (51 choose 3)]

= (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * 51! / (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * 51!)

= (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2

= 4/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4/27 compared to Deck B.
