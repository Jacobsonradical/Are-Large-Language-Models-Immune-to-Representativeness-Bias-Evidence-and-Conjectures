To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing a single card marked X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single card marked O is 1/3. So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243.

In Deck B, the probability of drawing a single card marked X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single card marked O is 2/3. So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/243.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A * Prior odds of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B * Prior odds of Deck B

The prior odds can be assumed to be 1, as we have no information about the selected deck before drawing the cards.

So, the posterior odds = (8/243) / (2/243) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4:1.
