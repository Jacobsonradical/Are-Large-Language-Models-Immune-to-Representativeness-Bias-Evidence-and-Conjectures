To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O|A), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O|B).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B

Given that we know the proportions of X and O in each deck, we can calculate these probabilities:
P(A) = (Number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A)
P(B) = (Number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B)

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B):

P(3X, 1O|A) = (Number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A)

The number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the number of combinations of choosing 3 X's out of 2/3 of the cards, which is C(2/3, 3), times the number of ways to choose 1 O out of 1/3 of the cards, which is C(1/3, 1).

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A is C(2/3 * N, 4), where N is the total number of cards in Deck A.

Similarly, for Deck B:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (Number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B)

The number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by the number of combinations of choosing 3 X's out of 1/3 of the cards, which is C(1/3, 3), times the number of ways to choose 1 O out of 2/3 of the cards, which is C(2/3, 1).

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B is C(1/3 * M, 4), where M is the total number of cards in Deck B.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

= P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

= (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1)) / (C(2/3 * N, 4)) * P(A)
/ (C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1)) / (C(1/3 * M, 4)) * P(B)

Since we don't have the exact card counts for Decks A and B, we can't calculate the exact posterior odds. However, we can express these odds in terms of the proportions of X and O in each deck. The denominator and numerator cancel out, leaving us with the ratio of the probabilities P(A) and P(B).

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: P(A) / P(B)}

This ratio will favor Deck A if P(A) > P(B), and Deck B if P(A) < P(B). The exact value depends on the specific proportions of X and O in each deck.
