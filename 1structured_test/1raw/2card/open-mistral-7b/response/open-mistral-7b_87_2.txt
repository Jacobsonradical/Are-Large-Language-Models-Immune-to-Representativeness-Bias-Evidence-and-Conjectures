To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as N (for both Decks A and B).

The probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B are as follows:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(N, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(N, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(N, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(N, 4)

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)] * [P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)]}

Note that the prior probability of drawing a card from Deck A or Deck B is equal, as both decks were chosen at random. So we can assume P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

However, without knowing the exact size of the decks (N), we cannot calculate the exact odds. But we can say that if Deck A has more X's marked than Deck B, then the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A should be higher than from Deck B. Therefore, the posterior odds should favor Deck A.
