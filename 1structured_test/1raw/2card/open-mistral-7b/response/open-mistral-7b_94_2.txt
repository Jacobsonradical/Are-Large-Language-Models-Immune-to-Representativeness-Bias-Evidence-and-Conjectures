To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, and then calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck.

Prior probabilities:
P(Deck A) = 1/2 (since we don't know which deck was drawn)
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Likelihoods:
Let L(Deck A) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A, and L(Deck B) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B.

For Deck A:
L(Deck A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^35

For Deck B:
L(Deck B) = C(36,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^35

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = L(Deck A) / L(Deck B)

After calculating the values of L(Deck A) and L(Deck B), we get:

Posterior odds â‰ˆ 1.08

The posterior odds suggest that the 4 cards were slightly more likely to be drawn from Deck A than Deck B, but the difference is not substantial. However, without more information, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.
