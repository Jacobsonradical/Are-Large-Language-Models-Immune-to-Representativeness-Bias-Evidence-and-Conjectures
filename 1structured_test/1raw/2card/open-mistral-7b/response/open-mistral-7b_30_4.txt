To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then take the ratio.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 X's and 8 O's (since there are 12 X's in deck A and 8 O's). This can be calculated as:

C(12, 3) * C(8, 1) = 220 * 8 = 1760

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the number of combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 8 X's and 12 O's (since there are 8 X's in deck B and 12 O's). This can be calculated as:

C(8, 3) * C(12, 1) = 56 * 12 = 672

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 1760 / 672} = {odds: 2.667}

The posterior odds are approximately 2.67 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is about 2.67 times more likely than Deck B to have been the source of the drawn cards.
