To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since there are 2/3 X's in Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3. The probability of drawing an O is 1/3. We use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3)
                          = 4/27

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since there are 1/3 X's in Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3. The probability of drawing an O is 2/3. We use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                          = 4/27

Since the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks is the same (4/27), the posterior odds are simply 1. This means that there is no evidence to favor either deck over the other based on the given information.

However, if we had additional information, such as the number of cards in each deck or the total number of cards drawn from the deck, we could use that information to make a more informed decision. In this case, since the probabilities are equal, we cannot say that the 4 cards were more likely to be drawn from Deck A or Deck B.
