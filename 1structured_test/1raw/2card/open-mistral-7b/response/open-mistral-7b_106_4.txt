To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn as X and the number of O's drawn as O.

For Deck A:
P(X=3, O=1 | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^0 + C(5, 3) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 3) * (2/3)^6 * (1/3)^2
                                  = (35) * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^1 + (21) * (0.4)^4 * (0.6)^0 + (14) * (0.4)^5 * (0.6)^1 + (7) * (0.4)^6 * (0.6)^2
                                  = 0.00648

For Deck B:
P(X=3, O=1 | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(5, 3) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^0 + C(4, 3) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^1 + C(3, 3) * (1/3)^6 * (2/3)^2
                                  = (20) * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^1 + (10) * (0.6)^4 * (0.4)^0 + (6) * (0.6)^5 * (0.4)^1 + (1) * (0.6)^6 * (0.4)^2
                                  = 0.0048

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 0.00648 / 0.0048 â‰ˆ 1.348}

So, given the observed data, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is approximately 1.348 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards.
