To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B respectively.

Let's denote the number of X's in a deck by X and the number of O's by O.

Deck A: P(X=2/3 * N) = 2/3 * N, where N is the total number of cards in Deck A.
P(O=1/3 * N) = 1/3 * N

Deck B: P(X=1/3 * N) = 1/3 * N
P(O=2/3 * N) = 2/3 * N

Now let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A: P(3X, 1O) = C(2/3 * N, 3) * C(1/3 * N, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Deck B: P(3X, 1O) = C(1/3 * N, 3) * C(2/3 * N, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now we have the probabilities of drawing 3X, 1O from both decks. The posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

To calculate these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / P(3X, 1O)

However, without knowing the total number of cards N or the specific values of X and O, we cannot calculate the exact probabilities and posterior odds.

To provide an answer, we would need more information about the total number of cards in each deck or the specific values of X and O.
