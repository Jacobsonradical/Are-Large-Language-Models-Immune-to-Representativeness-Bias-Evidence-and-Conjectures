To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

In Deck A:
P(3X, 1O) = C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                = 20 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                = 2/27

In Deck B:
P(3X, 1O) = C(9, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                = 84 * (1/27)^3 * (1/3)
                = 84 * (1/27)^2 * (1/3)
                = 84 * (1/729)
                ≈ 0.0114

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = (2/27) / (0.0114)
    ≈ 176.88

The posterior odds are then given by multiplying the prior odds (which are 1 in this case, as we have no prior knowledge about which deck was drawn) by the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 176.88}

So, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, the odds are about 176.88 to 1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
