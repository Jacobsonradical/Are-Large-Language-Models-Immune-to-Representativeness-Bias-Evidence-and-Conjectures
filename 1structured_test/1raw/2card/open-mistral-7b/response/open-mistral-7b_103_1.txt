To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O | Deck A), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O | Deck B).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | Deck A):

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | Deck B):

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2

The prior odds are given as the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being chosen:

P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (1/2)

Now, we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

After calculating the probabilities and substituting them into the equation, the posterior odds come out to be:

{odds: 0.632}

So, given the observation of drawing 3X and 1O cards, the odds are approximately 0.632 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, compared to Deck B.
