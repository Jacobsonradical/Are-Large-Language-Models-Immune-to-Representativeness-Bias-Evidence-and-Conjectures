To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then compare these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^8

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^14

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

After calculating the probabilities and simplifying the expression, the odds are approximately 10.5.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is about 10.5 times higher than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
