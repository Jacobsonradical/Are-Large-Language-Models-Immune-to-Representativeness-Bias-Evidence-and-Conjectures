To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Since the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks are equal, the posterior odds are 1:1.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 1}
