To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide that by the prior odds.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A:
Probability of drawing an X = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O = 1/3

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243

Deck B:
Probability of drawing an X = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O = 2/3

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, let's calculate the prior odds. Since 2/3 of the cards are marked X in Deck A and 1/3 are marked X in Deck B, the prior odds are 2/1, or 2.

Finally, the posterior odds are the likelihood ratio times the prior odds:

Posterior odds = (8/243) / (2/243) * (2/1) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 4 times the odds of them being drawn from Deck B.
