To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * ((2/3)C1)
                             = (8/27) * (1/3) * (2/3)
                             = 8/243

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                             = (1/27) * (4/9)
                             = 4/81

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X 1O | Deck A) / P(3X 1O | Deck B) = (8/243) / (4/81) = 2/9

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = L * Prior odds

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the two decks being chosen. Since the choice is made at random, the prior odds are equal to 1:

P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2

So, the posterior odds are:

odds = L * Prior odds = (2/9) * (1) = 2/9

The odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2/9.
