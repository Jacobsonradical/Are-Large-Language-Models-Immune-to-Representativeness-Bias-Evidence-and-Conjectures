To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A versus Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios and then multiply them by the prior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(27, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Now, we can find the likelihood ratios:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Calculating the probabilities and likelihood ratios, we get:

LR ≈ 0.109 / 0.044 ≈ 2.54

Since the prior odds are 2 (Deck A has more X-marked cards), the posterior odds are:

{odds: 2 * LR ≈ 2 * 2.54 ≈ 5.08}
