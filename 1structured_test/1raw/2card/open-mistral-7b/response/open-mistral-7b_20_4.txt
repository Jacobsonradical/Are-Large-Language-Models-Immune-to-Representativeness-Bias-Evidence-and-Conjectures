To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate the probabilities given the decks' compositions:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (C(12, 3) / C(18, 4))
P(A) = (2/3)^12 * (1/3)^6

Here, C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Similarly,

P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (C(12, 3) / C(18, 4))
P(B) = (1/3)^12 * (2/3)^6

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR(A|B) = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

LR(A|B) = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (C(12, 3) / C(18, 4))) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (C(12, 3) / C(18, 4)))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

LR(A|B) = 2^3 / (2^3) = 1

As the likelihood ratio is equal to 1, the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are also 1:

{odds: 1}

This means that, given the observed data, there is no evidence to favor either deck over the other. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either deck is equal.
