To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O | Deck A), and the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O | Deck B).

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^0
                  = 220 * (1/27) + 495 * (1/81)
                  = 220/81 + 495/81
                  = 715/81

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^0
                  = 84 * (1/6)^3 * (2/3) + 153 * (1/6)^4
                  = 84 * (1/216) * (2/3) + 153 * (1/129)
                  = 32/65

Now, let's denote the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B as P(Deck A) and P(Deck B), respectively. They are equal because we assumed that both decks are equally likely to be selected:

P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
     = (715/81) * (1/2) / (32/65) * (1/2)
     = 715 * (1/2) / (32 * (1/2))
     = 3575 / 64

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 3575/64.
