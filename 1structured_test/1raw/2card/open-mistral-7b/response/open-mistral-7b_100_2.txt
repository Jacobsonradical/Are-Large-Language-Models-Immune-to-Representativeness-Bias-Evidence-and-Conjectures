To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first find the probabilities for each deck:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(24, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 + C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Note that the prior probability for Deck A and Deck B is equal, so we can ignore it in the calculation.

After calculating the probabilities and the odds, the final answer is:

{odds: 210/448}

This means that the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is approximately 210/448 times higher than the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
