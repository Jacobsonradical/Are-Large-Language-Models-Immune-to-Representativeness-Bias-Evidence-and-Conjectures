To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as drawing the cards from Deck A, and event B as drawing the cards from Deck B. We're given the following probabilities:

P(A) = probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = probability of drawing from Deck B

We're also given the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A
P(3X, 1O | B) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B

We're asked to find the posterior odds of A over B, which is defined as:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | A):

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3 * 12, 3) * (1/3 * 12) / C(12, 4)

Since the probability of picking 3 X's from Deck A is C(2/3 * 12, 3) (combination of selecting 3 X's from 8, which is 2/3 of the deck), and the probability of picking 1 O from Deck A is C(1/3 * 12, 1) (combination of selecting 1 O from 4, which is 1/3 of the deck).

Next, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3 * 12, 3) * (2/3 * 12) / C(12, 4)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing from each deck:

P(A) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2
P(B) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

After calculating the probabilities, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = 7 / 11

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 7 to 11.
