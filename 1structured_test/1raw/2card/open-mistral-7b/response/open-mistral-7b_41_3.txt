To calculate the posterior odds, we need to consider the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1 (since one deck is chosen at random)
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 1 = 0

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 8/243 = 2/72

Similarly, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(B) = 0, we can simplify the equation for P(B | 3X, 1O) to 0. Therefore, the posterior probability of drawing from Deck B given the observed data is 0.

Now, we can calculate the odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(A | 3X, 1O) / 0

Since P(A | 3X, 1O) is a probability between 0 and 1, the odds are undefined in this case. However, this result implies that given the observed data, it is strongly favored that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
