To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck)

The number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck is C(2/3 * 52, 3). The number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck is C(1/3 * 52, 1). The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck is C(52, 4).

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 2/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck)

Now, we can calculate the prior odds:

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)

Let's assume that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, so P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

So, the prior odds are 1.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Using the calculations above, we can compute the likelihood ratio.

Finally, the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

Since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio.

So, the answer is:
{odds: likelihood ratio}
