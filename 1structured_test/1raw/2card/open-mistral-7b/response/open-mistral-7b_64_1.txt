To find the posterior odds, we need to compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A (A) is:
P(3X's and 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B (B) is:
P(3X's and 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we have the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), which are the proportions of X-marked cards in each deck:
P(A) = 2/3
P(B) = 1/3

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X's and 1O) = [P(3X's and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X's and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X's and 1O | B) * P(B)]

P(B | 3X's and 1O) = [P(3X's and 1O | B) * P(B)] / [P(3X's and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X's and 1O | B) * P(B)]

The odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

odds = P(A | 3X's and 1O) / P(B | 3X's and 1O)

After calculating the probabilities, the odds are approximately:

{odds: 5.0}

However, it's essential to note that the exact numbers can vary depending on the specific values used for calculations, including the number of cards in the decks.
