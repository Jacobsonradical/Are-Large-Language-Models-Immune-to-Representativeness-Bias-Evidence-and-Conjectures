To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^1
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (18) * (1/9)
                             = 220 * (2/9)
                             = 220/27

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^1
                             = 1530 * (1/27) * (1/2)
                             = 1530 * (1/54)
                             = 28/9

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                          = (220/27) / (28/9)
                          ≈ 220/27 * 9/28
                          ≈ 88/9

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the likelihood ratio and multiplying it by the prior odds, which is 1 (since we have no prior knowledge about which deck was drawn):

Posterior Odds = Likelihood Ratio * Prior Odds
                        ≈ 88/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is approximately 88 to 9 compared to Deck B.
