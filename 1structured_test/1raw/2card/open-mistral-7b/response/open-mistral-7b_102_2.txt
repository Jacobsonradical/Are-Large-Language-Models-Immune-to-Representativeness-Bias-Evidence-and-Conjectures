To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both decks:

1. Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck A: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck A: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws: (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243

2. Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck B: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck B: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws: (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 8/243 / 2/81}

To simplify the odds, divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

{odds: 4 : 162}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4 to 162.
