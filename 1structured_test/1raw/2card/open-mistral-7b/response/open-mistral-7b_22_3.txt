To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

Likelihood of Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Likelihood of Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Posterior odds = (2/27) / (1/8)

Posterior odds = 8/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8/27.
