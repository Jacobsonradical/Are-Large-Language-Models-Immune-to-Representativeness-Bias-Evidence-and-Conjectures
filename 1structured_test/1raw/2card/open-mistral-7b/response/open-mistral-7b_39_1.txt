To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then calculate the prior odds. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12,3) / (C(18,4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1)
          = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 220 / (27 * 108)
          = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 220 / 3240
          = 220 / 10824

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12,3) / (C(18,4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1)
          = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 220 / (27 * 1260)
          = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 220 / 33120
          = 220 / 364660

Now let's find the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
                 = 2 * (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O))
                 = 2 * (220 / 10824) / (220 / 364660)
                 = 2 * 364660 / 10824 * 10824 / 220 * 2
                 ≈ 2 * 168135 / 48428 * 48428 / 220 * 2
                 ≈ 2 * 168135 / 97256 * 48428 / 220 * 2
                 ≈ 3.27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 3.27 to 1 compared to Deck B. This suggests that, given the information that 3X and 1O cards were drawn, it is slightly more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A instead of Deck B.
