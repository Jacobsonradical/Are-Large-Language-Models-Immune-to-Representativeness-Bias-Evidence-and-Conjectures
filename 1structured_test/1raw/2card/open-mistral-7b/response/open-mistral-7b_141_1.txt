To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from A)
P(3X1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 * (1/27) = 8 * 1/3 = 8/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from A)

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from B)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from B)
P(3X1O|B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 560 * (1/27) = 20 * 1/3 = 20/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from B)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck under the assumption that one of the decks was drawn at random:

P(3X1O|A and drawn from A) = P(A) * P(3X1O|A)
P(3X1O|B and drawn from B) = P(B) * P(3X1O|B)

Since the decks were drawn at random, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (probability of drawing either deck)

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X1O) / P(B|3X1O)

= [P(A) * P(3X1O|A)] / [P(B) * P(3X1O|B)]

= [(1/2) * (8/27)] / [(1/2) * (20/27)]

= 8/27 / 20/27

= 8/40 / 20/40

= 1/5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/5.

Therefore, {odds: 1/5}
