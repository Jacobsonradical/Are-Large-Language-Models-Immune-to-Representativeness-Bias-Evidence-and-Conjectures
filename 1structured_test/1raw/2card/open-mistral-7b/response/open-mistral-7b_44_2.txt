To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A
- P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B
- P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 1/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 1/27

The prior odds are:
P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed event given the two hypotheses:
Likelihood ratio = P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | A) / P(X_1, X_2, X_3, O | B) = 1/27 / 1/27 = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is:

{odds: 2}

This means that, given the observed event, the probability of the event having occurred in Deck A is twice as high as the probability of it having occurred in Deck B. However, since the likelihood ratio is 1, this observation does not provide any additional information to distinguish between the two decks.
