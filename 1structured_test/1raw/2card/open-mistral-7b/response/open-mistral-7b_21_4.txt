To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Deck A:
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2/3) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3) = 2/243

Deck B:
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 2/81

Now, let's find the prior odds:

Prior odds of Deck A over Deck B = Probability of Deck A / Probability of Deck B
                                        = (2/3) / (1/3)
                                        = 2

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B
                      = (2/243) / (2/81)
                      = 81/243

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
                 = 2 * (81/243)
                 = 162/243

So, the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 1.66 to 1. This means that, given the information that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, it is slightly more likely (but not strongly so) that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X.
