To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards are marked X in Deck A and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing a single X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O card is 1/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is:

P(3X's and 1 O from Deck A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards are marked X in Deck B and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing a single X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O card is 2/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is:

P(3X's and 1 O from Deck B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, let's find the odds of drawing 4 cards with these characteristics from Deck A compared to Deck B:

odds = P(3X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(3X's and 1 O from Deck B)

After calculating the probabilities, we get:

odds = (2/9) / (1/27)

odds = 2 / 3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2:1. The 4 cards are more likely to have been drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
