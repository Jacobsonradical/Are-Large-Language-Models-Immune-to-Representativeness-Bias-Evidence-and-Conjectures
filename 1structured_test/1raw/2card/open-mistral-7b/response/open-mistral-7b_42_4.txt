To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A versus Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^(24-4)]
                                     = 220 / (24,368,800)
                                     ≈ 8.165 × 10^-6

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(24-4)]
                                     = 220 / (6,871,947,673,600)
                                     ≈ 3.225 × 10^-10

Now, let's find the odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)}
                 = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)
                 ≈ 8.165 × 10^-6 / 3.225 × 10^-10
                 ≈ 252.4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 252.4 to 1.
