To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide the probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^36
                                 = (220) * (1/27) * (36) * (1/27) * (268748)
                                 = 23044800 / 436807

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(54, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^54
                                 = (165) * (1/27) * (54) * (1/27) * (36288)
                                 = 5853440 / 436807

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)}
                 = [P(3X and 1O | Deck A)] / [P(3X and 1O | Deck B)]
                 = (23044800 / 436807) / (5853440 / 436807)
                 = 23044800 / 5853440
                 = 0.39407468

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.394075. This means that, given the information, Deck A is about 0.394 times more likely to have been the source of the drawn cards than Deck B.
