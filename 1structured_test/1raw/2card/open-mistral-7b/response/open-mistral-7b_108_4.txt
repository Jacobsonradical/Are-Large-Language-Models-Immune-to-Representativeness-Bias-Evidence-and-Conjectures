To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them. Let's first calculate the probabilities:

P(XXXO|DeckA) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/226

P(XXXO|DeckB) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(DeckA|XXXO) / P(DeckB|XXXO)
      = P(XXXO|DeckA) * P(DeckA) / P(XXXO|DeckB) * P(DeckB)

Given that the selection of the deck is random, the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so P(DeckA) = P(DeckB) = 1/2.

Plugging in the probabilities, we get:

odds = (8/226) * (1/2) / (2/81) * (1/2)
      = (8/226) * (1/2) / (1/40.5)
      = 8 / (226 * 40.5)
      = 0.0139

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.0139.
