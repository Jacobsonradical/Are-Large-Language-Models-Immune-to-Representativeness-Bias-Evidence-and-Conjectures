To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A versus Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                          = 220 * (1/243)
                          = 9/108

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 15,300 * (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
                          = 15,300 * (1/243) * (2/3)
                          = 10,600 / 243
                          = 43,760 / 729

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 9/108 / 43,760 / 729
     = 9 / (43,760 * 8)
     = 9 / 349,952

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 9 to 349,952.
