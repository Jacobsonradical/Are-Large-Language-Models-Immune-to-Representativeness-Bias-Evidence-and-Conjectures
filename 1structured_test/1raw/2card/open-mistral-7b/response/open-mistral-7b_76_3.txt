To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1

The probability of drawing 4 cards from either deck is 1. So, the prior probability is:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds(A | data) = P(data | A) * P(A) / P(data | B) * P(B)

Substituting the values:

odds(A | data) = [(2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1] * (1/2) / [(1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1] * (1/2)

Simplifying the fractions and calculating the value:

odds(A | data) = (2/3) / (1/2)

The final answer is {odds: 2} which means the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2 times higher than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B.
