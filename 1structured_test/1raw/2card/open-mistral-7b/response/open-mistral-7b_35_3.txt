To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

We know that:
P(A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
P(B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
               = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
               = 220/273

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X|B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
               = 220 * (1/27) * (2/3)
               = 440/273

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Since P(3X, 1O) is the same for both decks, we can cancel it out:

odds = (P(3X|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X|B) * P(B))

Substituting the values we calculated earlier:

odds = (220/273 * 2/3) / (440/273 * 1/3)

Simplifying the fraction:

odds = (440 / 819) / (440 / 819)

odds = 2/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2/3.
