To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then find the likelihood ratios between the two decks.

Prior probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(7, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(7, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^6
                        = 0.0026 + 0.0069 + 0.0267 ≈ 0.0362

Prior probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(10, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(10, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9
                        = 0.0004 + 0.0006 + 0.0012 ≈ 0.0022

Likelihood ratio for Deck A over Deck B:
L(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 1.64

Now, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds:

Posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A = L(Deck A | 3X, 1O) * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)

Since the two decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds are 1. However, we do not have enough information to directly calculate P(Deck A) and P(Deck B). Therefore, we cannot provide an exact answer to the question. Instead, we can provide the likelihood ratio as our answer, which represents the relative likelihood of the observed data given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B. The higher the likelihood ratio, the more likely it is that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
