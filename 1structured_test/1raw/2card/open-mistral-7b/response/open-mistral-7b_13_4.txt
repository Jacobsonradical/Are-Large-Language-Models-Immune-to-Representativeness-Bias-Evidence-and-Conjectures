To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/9) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds. Since we started with equal prior odds (Deck A and Deck B have equal likelihood), the posterior odds are:

{odds: 4}

So, given the observed data, the 4 cards are 4 times more likely to have been drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
