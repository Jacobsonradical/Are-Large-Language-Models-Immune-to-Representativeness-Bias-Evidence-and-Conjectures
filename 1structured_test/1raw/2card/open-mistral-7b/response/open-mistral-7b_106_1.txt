To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide that by the prior odds (the odds before drawing any cards).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

Probability (3 X's, 1 O from Deck A) = (2/3)(1/2)^3 * (1/3) * (2/3)^1
                                                      = (1/6) * (1/8) * (1/2) * (2/3)
                                                      = 1/144

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Probability (3 X's, 1 O from Deck B) = (1/3)(1/2)^3 * (2/3) * (1/3)^1
                                                      = (1/27) * (1/8) * (1/3)
                                                      = 1/288

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = [Probability (3 X's, 1 O from Deck A)] / [Probability (3 X's, 1 O from Deck B)]
                         = (1/144) / (1/288)
                         = 144 / 288
                         = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 1/2 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that after observing 3 X's and 1 O, Deck B is as likely as Deck A to have been the source of the cards.
