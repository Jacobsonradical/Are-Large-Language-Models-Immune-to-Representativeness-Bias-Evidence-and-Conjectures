To find the posterior odds of drawing cards from Deck A over Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(27, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4) = 0.016
   P(Deck A) = 2/3

2. Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(17, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4) = 0.011
   P(Deck B) = 1/3

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

{odds: 0.016 / 0.011 â‰ˆ 1.45}

So the posterior odds of drawing cards from Deck A is approximately 1.45 times higher than drawing cards from Deck B.
