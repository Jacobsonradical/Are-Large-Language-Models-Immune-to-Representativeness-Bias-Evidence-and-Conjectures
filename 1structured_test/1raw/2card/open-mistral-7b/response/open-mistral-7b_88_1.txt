To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(3, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(3, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
                            = 8 * (1/27) + 6 * (1/81) + 1 * (1/273)
                            = 32/27 + 6/81 + 1/273
                            = 48/273

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(3, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(3, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
                            = 8 * (1/27) + 6 * (1/81) + 1 * (1/273)
                            = 32/273

Now, the likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 48/273 / 32/273 = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the prior odds do not change after observing the 4 cards. Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 1}
