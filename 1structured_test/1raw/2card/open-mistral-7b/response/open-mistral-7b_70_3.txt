To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's calculate the probabilities first:

1. Deck A: P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
   P(3X 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

2. Deck B: P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
   P(3X 1O|B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's define the prior odds as the odds of Deck A before drawing the cards:
P(A)/P(B) = 1 (since we have no initial information)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds can be calculated as:

{odds: P(A|3X 1O) / P(B|3X 1O)} = {P(3X 1O|A) * P(A)} / {P(3X 1O|B) * P(B)}

Plugging in the probabilities:

{odds: (P(3X 1O|A)) / (P(3X 1O|B))} = {(C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)} = {(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1} / {(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1} = {2/3} / {1/3} = 2:1

So, the posterior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
