To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

Deck A:
P(X|A) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
         = 2/3

P(O|A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
         = 1/3

P(3X1O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)
           = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Deck B:
P(X|B) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
         = 1/3

P(O|B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
         = 2/3

P(3X1O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)
           = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X1O) / P(Deck B | 3X1O)
                = P(3X1O|A) / P(3X1O|B)

Using the probabilities we calculated above:

Posterior odds = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Posterior odds = 8/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, is 8/27.
