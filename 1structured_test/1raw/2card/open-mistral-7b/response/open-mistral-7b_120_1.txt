To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 51, 3) * (1/3 * 49)^1
                              = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (49!) / (51! * 3!)
                              = (2/3^3 * 49) / (51 * 3)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 51, 3) * (2/3 * 49)^1
                              = (1/3)^3 * (49!) / (51! * 3!)
                              = (1/3^3 * 49) / (51 * 3)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
          = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
          = (2/3^3 * 49) / (51 * 3) / ((1/3^3 * 49) / (51 * 3))
          = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3
          = (2/3)^3 * (3/1)^3
          = 8

So, the posterior odds are 8 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observation of 3 X and 1 O cards, the probability of Deck A being chosen is 8 times greater than the probability of Deck B being chosen.
