To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probability for both decks:

1. Deck A:
   Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from a deck of 12 (4 drawn cards, where 2/3 are X and 1/3 are O) is given by the binomial probability:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 4) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1
   = 495 * (1/27) * (1/3)
   = 495/243

2. Deck B:
   The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from a deck of 12 (4 drawn cards, where 1/3 are X and 2/3 are O) is:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(12, 4) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1
   = 495 * (1/27) * (2/9)
   = 495/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = {P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)}

= {495/243} / {495/81}

= (495 * 81) / (243 * 495)

= 81/243

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, is 81/243.
