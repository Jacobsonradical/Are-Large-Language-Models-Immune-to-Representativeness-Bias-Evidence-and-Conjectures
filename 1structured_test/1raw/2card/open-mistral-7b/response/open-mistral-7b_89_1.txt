To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X,1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(A|4X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1) * (1) + (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) * (1) + (2/3)^2 * (1/3) * (1) * (2/3) + (2/3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (2/3)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(B|4X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1) * (1) + (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1) * (2/3) + (1/3)^2 * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1) + (1/3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3) * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
odiors = P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O)

After calculating the probabilities, we find that the posterior odds are approximately 1.47 in favor of Deck A.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 1.47}
