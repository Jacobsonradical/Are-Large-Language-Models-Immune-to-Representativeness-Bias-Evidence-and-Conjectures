To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A)

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A is C(2/3 * Number of cards in Deck A, 3) + C(1/3 * Number of cards in Deck A, 3), where C is the number of combinations.

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is C(2/3 * Number of cards in Deck A, 3) * C(1/3 * Number of cards in Deck A, 1).

Similarly, we can find P(B|3X, 1O) by calculating the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}

Please note that the exact values of the probabilities depend on the total number of cards in each deck, which is not provided in the question. You would need this information to calculate the exact odds.
