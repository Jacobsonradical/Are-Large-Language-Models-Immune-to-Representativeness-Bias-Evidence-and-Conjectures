To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
   Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from a deck of 12 cards (4X and 8O) = C(12, 3) * C(8, 1)
   = (12! / (3! * 9!)) * (8! / (1! * 7!))
   = 220 * 56
   = 12,320

   Probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes in Deck A)
   = 12,320 / (C(16, 4))
   = 12,320 / 1820
   = 6.81

2. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
   Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from a deck of 12 cards (4X and 8O) = C(12, 3) * C(8, 1)
   = 220 * 56
   = 12,320

   Probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes in Deck B)
   = 12,320 / (C(20, 4))
   = 12,320 / 4845
   = 2.53

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 6.81 / 2.53 â‰ˆ 2.68}

So, the posterior odds are approximately 2.68 times higher that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
