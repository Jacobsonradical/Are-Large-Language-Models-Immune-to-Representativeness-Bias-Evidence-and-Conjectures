To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                      ≈ 0.1389

Next, find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(19, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                      ≈ 0.0272

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = 0.1389 / 0.0272
   ≈ 5.09

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 5.09}
