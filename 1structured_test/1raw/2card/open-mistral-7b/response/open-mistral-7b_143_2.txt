To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that we drew 4 cards.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A)
           = (C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)) / C(24, 4)
           = (220 * 12) / 4862
           = 2640 / 4862

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B)
           = (C(18, 3) * C(18, 1)) / C(36, 4)
           = (1530 * 18) / 8060
           = 27420 / 8060

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B:

P(A) = Number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's = (C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)) / C(24, 4) = 2640 / 4862
P(B) = Number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's = (C(18, 1) * C(18, 3)) / C(36, 4) = 18 * 27420 / 8060 = 54840 / 8060

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (2640 / 4862) / (27420 / 8060) = 2640 / (27420 * 4862/8060) = 2640 / 2375110

So the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A is approximately 2640 to 2375110. This means it is more likely, but not by much, that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B, which has more O's. However, since the actual probability is not a whole number, we cannot express it as a simple fraction.
