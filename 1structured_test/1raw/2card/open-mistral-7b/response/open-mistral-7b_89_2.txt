To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X and 1 O cards) given Deck A versus Deck B. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

Given that in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A can be calculated as:

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/273

Similarly, given that in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B can be calculated as:

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

The likelihood ratio is then given by:

L = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = 8/273 / 8/243 = 273/243

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds, which is the probability of Deck A relative to Deck B before drawing any cards. Since we are given that each deck is equally likely, the prior odds is 1. Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 273/243}

This means that, given the observed event of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards, Deck A is approximately 2.73 times more likely to be the deck from which the cards were drawn compared to Deck B.
