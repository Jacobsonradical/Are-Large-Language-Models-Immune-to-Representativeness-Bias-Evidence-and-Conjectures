To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that we know 2/3 of Deck A is marked X and 1/3 is marked O, and 1/3 of Deck B is marked X and 2/3 is marked O.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Now let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2/3)^4

Finally, let's assume the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B is 1, which means there is no initial preference between the two decks. The posterior odds are then equal to the likelihood ratio:
{odds: (2/3)^4}
