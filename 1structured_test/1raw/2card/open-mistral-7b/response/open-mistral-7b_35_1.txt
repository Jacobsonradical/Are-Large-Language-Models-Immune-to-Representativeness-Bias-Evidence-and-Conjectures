To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * (36) - 1, 3) * (1/3 * 36)^1 * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1)
                 = C(24, 3) * (12)^1 * (1/81)
                 = 24! / (21! * 3!) * 12 * 1/81
                 = 220

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * (36) - 1, 3) * (2/3 * 36)^1 * ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
                 = C(11, 3) * (12)^1 * (1/81)
                 = 11! / (8! * 3!) * 12 * 1/81
                 = 165

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 220 / 165}

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.33 to 1. This means that given the evidence, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B to be the deck from which the cards were drawn. However, the difference is not very significant.
