To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                                 = 286

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                                 = 120

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = 286 / 120 = 2.3833

The posterior odds are then given by the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds (since Deck A has more X's, we assume it is more likely and set the prior odds to 2):

{odds: 2 * 2.3833 = 4.7666}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 4.77 times higher than the odds they were drawn from Deck B.
