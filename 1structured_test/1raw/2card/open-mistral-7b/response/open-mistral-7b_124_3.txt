To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck A) + C(26, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck A)
                            = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (2/3) + (2720) * (1/27) * (2/9) * (2/3)
                            = (220/6561) + (1088/17584)
                            = 1308/34225

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck B) + C(27, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck B)
                            = (2002) * (1/27) * (2/9) * (1/3) + (27) * (1/27) * (1/27) * (2/3)
                            = (1001/17584) + (1/17584)
                            = 1002/17584

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
         = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
         = [(1308/34225) * (2/3)] / [(1002/17584) * (1/3)]
         = (2616/58250) / (1002/5296)
         ≈ 2616/1002 * 5296/58250
         ≈ 0.52

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.52. This means that Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B to have been the source of the 4 cards, given that 3 are X's and 1 is O.
