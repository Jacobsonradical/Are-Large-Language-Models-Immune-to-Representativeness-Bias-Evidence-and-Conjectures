To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck:

Deck A: (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2*1*1)/(3*3*3) * (1/3) = 2/27
Deck B: (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1*1*1)/(3*3*3) * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = (2/27) / (2/27) = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the prior odds do not change, and the posterior odds are also 1. Therefore, there is no evidence to favor drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, or vice versa.
