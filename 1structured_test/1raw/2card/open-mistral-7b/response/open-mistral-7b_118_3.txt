To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)
                            = (220/288) * (1/27) + (120/288) * (4/27)^2
                            = (220/288) * (1/27) + (120/288) * (1/129)
                            = (220 + 10)/288 * (1/27 + 1/129)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(6, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)
                            = (20/288) * (1/27) + (15/288) * (1/27)^2 * 4
                            = (20/288) * (1/27) + (60/288) * (1/129)
                            = (20 + 24)/288 * (1/27 + 1/129)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

After calculating the values, we get:

LR = (220 + 10)/(20 + 24) * (1/27 + 1/129) / ((20 + 24)/288 * (1/27 + 1/129))

The posterior odds can then be calculated by multiplying the likelihood ratio with the prior odds, which is 2 (Deck A is more likely to have been drawn) because Deck A has more X-marked cards:

{odds: 2 * LR}
