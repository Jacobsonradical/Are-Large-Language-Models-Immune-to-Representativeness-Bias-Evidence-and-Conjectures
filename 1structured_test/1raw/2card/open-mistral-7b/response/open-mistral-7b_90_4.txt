To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A (denoted as P(A|3X, 1O)) and Deck B (denoted as P(B|3X, 1O)):

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^4)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^4)

Now, let's find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A (P(A)) and Deck B (P(B)):

P(A) = 1/2 (since the two decks have an equal chance of being selected)
P(B) = 1/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Calculate the values and take the result.
