To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
P(3X | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^(12-3)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck B is given by the binomial distribution:
P(3X | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(18-3)

The probability of drawing 4 cards from either deck is 1.

The prior probability of drawing from deck A is 1/2 (since we assume both decks are equally likely).

The posterior odds are given by:

odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)
     = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]
     = (P(3X | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X | B) * P(B))

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

odds = [C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^9] / [C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^15] * (1/2)

To simplify this expression, you can use a calculator or a computer algebra system. The result is approximately 1.25.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.25 times higher than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B. This means that, given the observation of 3X and 1O, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B.
