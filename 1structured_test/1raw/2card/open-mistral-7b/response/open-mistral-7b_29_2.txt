To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X,1O). In Deck A, the probability of drawing a single X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3. Given that we have already drawn 3 X's, the remaining probability of drawing an X is (2/3)*(1-2/3)^3 = 1/8. The probability of drawing an O is (1/3)*(1-1/3) = 2/3.

Therefore, P(A|3X,1O) = (1/8)*(2/3) = 1/12.

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X,1O). In Deck B, the probability of drawing a single X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3. Given that we have already drawn 3 X's, the remaining probability of drawing an X is (1/3)*(1-1/3)^3 = 1/8. The probability of drawing an O is (2/3)*(1-2/3) = 1/3.

Therefore, P(B|3X,1O) = (1/8)*(1/3) = 1/24.

Now, to find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio:

{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (1/12)/(1/24) = 1/2}

However, this result is not in the required format. To obtain a single number, we can convert the odds ratio to a logarithmic scale:

{odds: log2(P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) = log2(1/2) = -1}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is -1. This means that Deck B is slightly more likely than Deck A given the observed data. However, it's important to note that this result is based on the assumption that the decks were selected at random and that the observed data is independent and identically distributed. In real-world applications, these assumptions may not hold, and the results may be different.
