To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9
                    = 220 * (1/27) * (2/66)
                    = 4400 / 2187

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^15
                    = 1814 * (1/273)

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 4 cards from each deck:

P(A) = (2/3)^16
P(B) = (1/3)^16 * (2/3)^12

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) * P(A) / P(B)
      = [(4400 / 2187) * (1/27)] / [(1814 / 273)] * (2/3)^16 / [((1/3)^16 * (2/3)^12)]
      = (4400 / 2187) * (1/27) / (1814 / 273) * (8 / 27)
      = (4400 / 2187) * (1/27) * (273 / 1814) * (8 / 27)
      = (4400 * 8) / (2187 * 1814)
      = 352 / 398525

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.000088 or 1 in 11,317.
