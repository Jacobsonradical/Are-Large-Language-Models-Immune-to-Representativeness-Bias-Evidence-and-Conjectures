To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Simplifying this expression, we get:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0172

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2

Simplifying this expression, we get:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0286

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds of Deck A over Deck B:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
       = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
       ≈ 0.0172 / 0.0286
       ≈ 0.5957

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.5957. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B to have been the source of the drawn cards. However, it's important to note that this is a relatively weak preference, as the odds are not significantly larger than 1.
