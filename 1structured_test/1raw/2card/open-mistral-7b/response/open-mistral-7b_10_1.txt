To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A
- P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1/2 (since we don't know which deck was drawn)
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1/2

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck:

P(X_3, O_1 | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X_3, O_1 | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Since the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from both decks is the same, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O given the drawn cards:

Likelihood = P(X_3, O_1 | A) = 8/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Likelihood * Prior odds / Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from the selected deck

Since we don't know which deck was drawn, we can't calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from the selected deck directly. However, we can express it as a function of P(A) and P(B):

Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from the selected deck = P(X_3, O_1 | A) * P(A) + P(X_3, O_1 | B) * P(B)

Since the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from both decks is the same, we can set this equation equal to the likelihood we calculated earlier, and solve for P(A):

8/27 * P(A) + 8/27 * P(B) = 8/27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(A) = 1/3

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (8/27) * (1/3) / (8/27) = 1/3

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) is 1/3. This means that, given the drawn cards, the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is less than the probability of them being drawn from Deck B.
