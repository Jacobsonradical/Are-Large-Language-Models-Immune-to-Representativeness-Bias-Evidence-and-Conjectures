To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B respectively.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X,1O). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is the probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck A, followed by drawing 1 O from Deck A.

The probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck A is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 2/3 of the cards, which is C(2/3, 3). The probability of drawing 1 O from Deck A is given by the combination of choosing 1 O out of 1/3 of the cards, which is C(1/3, 1).

So, P(A|3X,1O) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X,1O). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is the probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck B, followed by drawing 1 O from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck B is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 1/3 of the cards, which is C(1/3, 3). The probability of drawing 1 O from Deck B is given by the combination of choosing 1 O out of 2/3 of the cards, which is C(2/3, 1).

So, P(B|3X,1O) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we have the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks. The odds of Deck A over Deck B, given the drawn cards, are then given by the ratio of their probabilities:

{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)}
