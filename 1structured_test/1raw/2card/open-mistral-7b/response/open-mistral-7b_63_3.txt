To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them. Let's calculate the likelihood first:

1. Deck A:
   P(X|A) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
           = 2/3
   P(O|A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
           = 1/3

   P(3X, 1O|A) = P(3X|A) * P(1O|A) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 6 X's and 4 O's)
               = (2/3) * (1/3) * (C(6, 3) * C(4, 1))
               = (2/3) * (1/3) * (20 * 4)
               = (20/27)

2. Deck B:
   P(X|B) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
           = 1/3
   P(O|B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
           = 2/3

   P(3X, 1O|B) = P(3X|B) * P(1O|B) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 X's and 6 O's)
               = (1/3) * (2/3) * (C(4, 3) * C(6, 1))
               = (1/3) * (2/3) * (4 * 6)
               = (8/27)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)}

P(A|3X, 1O) = (20/27) / (8/27)

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 20/8, which simplifies to 5/2.

So, the answer is {odds: 5/2}

This means that, given the observed data, the probability of the cards being drawn from Deck A is 5 times more likely than from Deck B.
