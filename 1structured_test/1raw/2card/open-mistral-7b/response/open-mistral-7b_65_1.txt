To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Since the probabilities are equal, the posterior odds would be 1:1. This means that, given the drawn cards, there is no more evidence to favor drawing from Deck A over Deck B, or vice versa.
