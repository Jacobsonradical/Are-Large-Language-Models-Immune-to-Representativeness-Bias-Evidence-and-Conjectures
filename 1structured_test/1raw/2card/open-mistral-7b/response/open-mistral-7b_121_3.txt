To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both decks:

1. Deck A:
   P(X|A) = number of X cards in deck A / total number of cards in deck A
           = 2/3
   P(O|A) = number of O cards in deck A / total number of cards in deck A
           = 1/3
   P(3X1O|A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
   where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient

2. Deck B:
   P(X|B) = number of X cards in deck B / total number of cards in deck B
           = 1/3
   P(O|B) = number of O cards in deck B / total number of cards in deck B
           = 2/3
   P(3X1O|B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|data) / P(B|data)} = {P(3X1O|A) * P(A)} / {P(3X1O|B) * P(B)}

where P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities, which are equal since neither deck is more likely to be chosen than the other:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Calculate the probabilities and the odds:

{odds: 0.1429 / 0.0226 â‰ˆ 6.33}

So, the posterior odds suggest that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A approximately 6.33 times more likely than from Deck B.
