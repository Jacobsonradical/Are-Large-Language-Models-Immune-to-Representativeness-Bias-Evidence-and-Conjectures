To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(26, 1) * (1/3)^1
                                   = 35 * (1/243) * (1/27) * 26 * (2/7)
                                   = 1320/10968

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(34, 1) * (2/3)^1
                                   = 840 * (1/27) * (1/2) * 34 * (1/2)
                                   = 840/567

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
      = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)
      = 1320/10968 / 840/567
      â‰ˆ 1.306

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.31 times larger than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B. This suggests that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B. However, the difference is not very significant, as the odds are close to 1. This means that the data does not provide strong evidence to favor either deck over the other.
