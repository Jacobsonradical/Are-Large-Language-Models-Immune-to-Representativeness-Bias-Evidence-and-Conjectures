To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that 4 cards were drawn.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X_A, 1O_A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                      = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                      = 220/273

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X_B, 1O_B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                      = 220 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                      = 220/81

The odds of drawing 4 cards with this distribution from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 220/273 / 220/81 = 273/81}

Final answer: {odds: 273/81}
