To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

The probability of drawing the first X from Deck A is 2/3. After drawing one X, there are now 22 X's and 17 O's left in the deck, making a total of 39 cards. So the probability of drawing the second X is 22/39. The probability of drawing the third X is 21/38. The probability of drawing an O is 17/38.

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
(2/3) * (22/39) * (21/38) * (17/38) = 0.0575

Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

The probability of drawing the first X from Deck B is 1/3. After drawing one X, there are now 19 X's and 27 O's left in the deck, making a total of 46 cards. So the probability of drawing the second X is 19/46. The probability of drawing the third X is 18/45. The probability of drawing an O is 27/45.

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
(1/3) * (19/46) * (18/45) * (27/45) = 0.0354

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B
= 0.0575 / 0.0354
â‰ˆ 1.62

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 1.62:1. This means that it is slightly more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B. However, note that this is a relatively small difference, and the actual probability could be different if we had more information or if we were to repeat the experiment multiple times.
