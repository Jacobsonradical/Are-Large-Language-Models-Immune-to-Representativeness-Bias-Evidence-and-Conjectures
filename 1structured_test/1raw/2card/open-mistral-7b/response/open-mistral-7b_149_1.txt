To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A versus Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^4]
                                        = 220 / 10,888 ≈ 0.0201

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(32, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^4]
                                        = 840 / 21,644 ≈ 0.0388

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)}
                                         = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)
                                         ≈ 0.0201 / 0.0388 ≈ 0.513

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.513. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B, but the difference is not significant.
