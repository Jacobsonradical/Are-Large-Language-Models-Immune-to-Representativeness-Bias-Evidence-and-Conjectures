To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them. The probability of drawing a single card marked X or O from each deck is given.

Let's calculate:

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = P(3X)|Deck A) * P(1O|Deck A)
                              = (2/3 C 3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)
                              = (2! / 3!) * (1/3)^4
                              = (2) * (1/81)
                              = 2/81

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = P(3X|Deck B) * P(1O|Deck B)
                              = (1/3 C 3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)
                              = (3! / 3!) * (2/27)
                              = 6 * (2/27)
                              = 12/27
                              = 4/9

Now, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)
               = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)
               = 2/81 / 4/9
               = 1/36

Answer: {odds: 1/36}
