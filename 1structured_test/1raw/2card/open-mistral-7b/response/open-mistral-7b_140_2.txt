To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing the first X is 2/3, then the probability of drawing the next 2 X's is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9. The probability of drawing the 4th X is 2/3 again, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3) * (4/9) * (1/3)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing the first X is 1/3, then the probability of drawing the next 2 X's is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. The probability of drawing the 4th X is 1/3 again, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3) * (1/9) * (2/3)

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we divide the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = [(2/3) * (4/9) * (1/3)] / [(1/3) * (1/9) * (2/3)] = 16/9}
