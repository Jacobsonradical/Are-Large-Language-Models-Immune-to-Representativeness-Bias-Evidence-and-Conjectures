To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's find P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B).

Since in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3

So, P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2^3 * 1^1) * ((2/3) * (1/3)^2) = 8/27

Similarly, since in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O:
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3

So, P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1^3 * 2^1) * ((1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1) = 1/27

Now, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):
- P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A = 1 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)
- P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B = 1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

odds = (8/27) / (1/27)

odds = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 8 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
