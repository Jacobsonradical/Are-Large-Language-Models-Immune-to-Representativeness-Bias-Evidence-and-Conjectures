To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
                      = (2! / 3!) * (1!) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                      = (2 * 1) * (1/27)
                      = 2/27

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                      = (1! / 3!) * (2!) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                      = (1 * 2) * (1/27) * (2/3)
                      = 2/27

Since the probabilities are the same for both decks, the posterior odds are 1:1. This means that, given the evidence of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, there is no stronger evidence to support that the cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B.
