To find the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, we first need to calculate the probabilities of this event happening in each deck.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

We know that in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/243

Similarly, in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/9) = 4/81

Now, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(A) = probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = probability of drawing from Deck B

Since the decks were chosen at random, their probabilities should be equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

The posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]

Using the calculated probabilities, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) = [(8/243) * (1/2)] / [((8/243) * (1/2)) + ((4/81) * (1/2))]

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) â‰ˆ 2/7

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately:

{odds: 2/7}
