To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

Let's calculate the likelihood first:

For Deck A:
L(A|3X, 1O) = C(3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(52-3) * (1/3)^(52-1)
                = 84 * (1/81) * (1/52) * (2/81)^51 * (1/81)^51
                = 84 * (1/81^2) * (2/6561)

For Deck B:
L(B|3X, 1O) = C(3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(52-3) * (2/3)^(52-1)
                = 84 * (1/27) * (1/52) * (1/27)^51 * (2/27)^51
                = 84 * (1/27^2) * (2/116689)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

{odds: L(A|3X, 1O) / L(B|3X, 1O)}

To simplify the calculation, we can note that the constant term 84 cancels out in the denominator and the numerator.

The rest of the terms can be further simplified:

{odds: (1/81^2) / (1/27^2)}

To find the ratio, we'll raise both denominators to the power of -1 and multiply the terms:

{odds: (81^2) / (27^2)}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 6561 / 162}
