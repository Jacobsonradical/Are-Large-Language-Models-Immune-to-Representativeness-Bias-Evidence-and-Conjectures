To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
              = (2! / 3! * 1!) * (1! / 1! * 2!)
              = (2 * 1) / (3 * 2!)
              = 2/6
              = 1/3

For Deck B:
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
              = (1! / 3! * 2!) * (2! / 2! * 1!)
              = (1 * 2) / (3 * 1!)
              = 2/3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
     = (1/3) / (2/3)
     = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1/2.
