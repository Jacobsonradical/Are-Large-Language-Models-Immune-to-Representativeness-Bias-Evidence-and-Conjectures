To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them by the prior probabilities of the decks being selected.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                 = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                 = 220/273

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                 = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                                 = 220/81

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of selecting each deck:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B
                          = (220/273) / (220/81)
                          = (220/273) * (81/220)
                          = 81 / 273

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 81/273.

To express this as a single number, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to get approximately 29.75:

{odds: 29.75}
