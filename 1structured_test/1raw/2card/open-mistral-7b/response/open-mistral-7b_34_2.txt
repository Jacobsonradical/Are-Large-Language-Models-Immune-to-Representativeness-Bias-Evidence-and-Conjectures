To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent Deck A and B represent Deck B.

P(A) = Probability of Deck A being selected
P(B) = Probability of Deck B being selected = 1 - P(A)

Let X represent drawing an X card and O represent drawing an O card.

P(X|A) = Probability of drawing an X card given Deck A = 2/3
P(O|A) = Probability of drawing an O card given Deck A = 1/3

P(X|B) = Probability of drawing an X card given Deck B = 1/3
P(O|B) = Probability of drawing an O card given Deck B = 2/3

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X 1O|A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.1667
P(3X 1O|B) = C(5, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.1667

The likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3X 1O|A) / P(3X 1O|B) = 0.1667 / 0.1667 = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is equal to 1, the posterior odds are also equal to 1. This means that, given the observed data, there is no evidence to favor Deck A over Deck B, or Deck B over Deck A.
