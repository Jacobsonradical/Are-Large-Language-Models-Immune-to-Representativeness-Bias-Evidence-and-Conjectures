To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards.

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A over Deck B is the ratio of the probability of drawing from Deck A to the probability of drawing from Deck B:

P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
                = 0.0096 + 0.048 + 0.096 = 0.151

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(24, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
                = 0.00024 + 0.0064 + 0.0192 = 0.02584

Now, we can calculate the likelihood of the event given each deck:

Likelihood of 3X and 1O given Deck A = P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O)
                        = 0.151 / (0.151 + 0.02584) ≈ 0.852

Likelihood of 3X and 1O given Deck B = P(3X and 1O | Deck B) / P(3X and 1O)
                        = 0.02584 / (0.151 + 0.02584) ≈ 0.148

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of 3X and 1O given Deck A / Likelihood of 3X and 1O given Deck B
               = 0.852 / 0.148 ≈ 5.71

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 5.71 to 1 compared to Deck B. This means that after observing the draw of 3X and 1O cards, the probability is about 5.71 times higher that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
