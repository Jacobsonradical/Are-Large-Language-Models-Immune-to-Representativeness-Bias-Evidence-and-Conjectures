To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
                                = 220 * (1/27) + 220 * (1/81) + 12 * (1/216)
                                = 220/27 + 220/81 + 12/216
                                = 352/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2
                                = 153 * (1/27) + 153 * (1/81) + 18 * (1/216)
                                = 153/27 + 153/81 + 18/216
                                = 604/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
          = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
          = (352/27) * (2/3) / (604/81) * (1/3)
          = (2 * 352) / (3 * 604)
          = 1056 / 1812
          â‰ˆ 0.584

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.584. This means that, given the observed data of 3X and 1O cards, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a definitive conclusion.
