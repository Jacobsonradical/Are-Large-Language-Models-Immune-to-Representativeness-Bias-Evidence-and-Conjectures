To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event that 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (event A) can be calculated as follows:

P(A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * [(2/3)C1 + (1/3)C1]
     = (2/3) * (1/3) * 4
     = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (event B) can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3) * [(1/3)C1 + (2/3)C1]
     = (1/3) * (2/3) * 4
     = 8/27

Since the events are equally likely to occur by chance, the prior odds are equal to 1:

P(A) / P(B) = 1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

P(A|observation) / P(B|observation) = P(observation|A) * P(A) / P(observation|B) * P(B)
                                                 = [(2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1] / [(2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (1/3)C1] * [1] / [(1/3)C3 * (2/3) * (1/3)C1] * [1]
                                                 = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is 2:1 compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is twice as likely as Deck B to be the source of the 4 cards.
