To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

After calculating these probabilities and the likelihood ratio, the posterior odds can be found by multiplying the likelihood ratio with the prior odds (since there is no prior information given, we'll consider the two decks as equally likely, so the prior odds are 1).

{odds: your answer as a single number}

This calculation would require the exact values of the combinations C(12, 3) and C(18, 3), which I cannot provide without a calculator or software that supports combinatorics.
