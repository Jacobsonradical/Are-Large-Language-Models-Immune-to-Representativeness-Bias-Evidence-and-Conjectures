To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as drawing 4 cards from Deck A and event B as drawing 4 cards from Deck B.

The prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A (P(A)) and Deck B (P(B)) are given. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O under each of these events can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.

Let's denote n as the total number of cards in each deck, which is not given but assumed to be the same for both decks for simplicity. Then the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(n, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

And the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(n, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

The posterior odds are then:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Unfortunately, without knowing the value of n, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the odds.
