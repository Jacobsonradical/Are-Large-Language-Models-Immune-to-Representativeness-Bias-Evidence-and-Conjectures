To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then compare these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
              = 220 * (1/27) + 220 * (1/81) + 12 * (1/243)
              = 220 * (1/27) + 220 * (1/81) + 1/21

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
              = 153 * (1/27) + 56 * (1/81) + 6 * (1/243)
              = 153 * (1/27) + 56 * (1/81) + 1/42

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
     = [(220 * (1/27) + 1/21) / (153 * (1/27) + 1/42)] / [(153 * (1/27) + 56 * (1/81) + 1/42) / (220 * (1/27) + 56 * (1/81) + 1/21)]
     = [(220 * 1 + 1) / (153 * 1 + 1)] / [(153 * 1 + 56) / (220 * 1 + 56)]
     = 221 / 209

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 221 to 209.
