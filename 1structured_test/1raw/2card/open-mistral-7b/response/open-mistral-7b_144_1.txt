To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X,1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(A|4X,1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards)

P(A|4X,1O) = (C(2/3,3) * C(1/3,1)) / C(60,4)

Where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k elements from a set of n elements.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as:

P(B|4X,1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 2/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards)

P(B|4X,1O) = (C(1/3,3) * C(2/3,1)) / C(60,4)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O) = [P(A) * P(4X,1O|A)] / [P(B) * P(4X,1O|B)]

Where P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B respectively, and are equal since each deck was chosen with equal probability.

So, the ratio P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O) is equal to [P(4X,1O|A)] / [P(4X,1O|B)]

This ratio will give us the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. However, calculating the exact values of these probabilities requires numerical methods or a computer program that can handle combinations.

Therefore, I cannot provide an exact numerical answer, but I hope this explanation helps you understand how to approach the problem.
