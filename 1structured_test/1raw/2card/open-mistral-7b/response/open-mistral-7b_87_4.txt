To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X and 1 O cards) given Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A and Deck B:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3)
                    = 0.042

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1 - (1/3)^3)
                    = 0.028

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

We don't have prior odds, so we'll assume they are equal (1) for simplicity.

{odds: 0.042 / 0.028 â‰ˆ 1.46}

So, given the observed event, the posterior odds favor Deck A (where most cards are marked X) over Deck B (where most cards are marked O) by a factor of approximately 1.46.
