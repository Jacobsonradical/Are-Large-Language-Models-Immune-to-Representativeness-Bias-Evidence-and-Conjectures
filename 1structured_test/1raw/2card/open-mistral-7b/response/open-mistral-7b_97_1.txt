To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then divide those probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Calculating this probability gives us:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0053

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Calculating this probability gives us:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0185

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

{odds: 0.0053 / 0.0185 ≈ 0.2857}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 0.2857 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that, given the observed data of 3X and 1O cards, there is about 0.286 times more evidence for the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
