To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O). In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws without replacement is given by the multinomial coefficient:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O). In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws without replacement is given by the multinomial coefficient:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Plug in the values:

LR = [C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplify the expression:

LR = (2^3 * 1^1) / (1^3 * 2^1)

LR = 8

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, is 8:1. This means that, given the observed data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the odds are 8 times higher that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
