To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
                                                                          = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 1!) * (1/3)
                                                                          = 2/27

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                                                                          = (1! * 1!) / (3! * 1!) * (2/3)
                                                                          = 2/27

Since the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks are the same, the posterior odds are also 1:1.

{odds: 1}

However, it's important to note that this result is based on the assumption that the selection of the deck and the drawing of the cards are independent events. If this assumption is not valid, then the calculation of the posterior odds would need to be adjusted accordingly.
