To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(24, 4) = 220 / 28845

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4) = 840 / 362880

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                        = (220 / 28845) / (840 / 362880)

Simplifying the fractions, we get:

Posterior odds ≈ 0.0347 / 0.0023 ≈ 15.26

The final answer is {odds: 15.26}
