To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them by the prior probabilities of each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial probability:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of each deck. Since Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, and Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, the prior probabilities are:

P(A) = (Number of ways to choose 12 X's and 12 O's from 24 cards) * (2/3)^12 * (1/3)^12
P(B) = (Number of ways to choose 18 X's and 6 O's from 24 cards) * (1/3)^18 * (2/3)^6

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = [P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)] / [P(A) / P(B)]

The final answer is {odds: your answer as a single number}. To find the actual number, you would need to calculate the values of all the probabilities.
