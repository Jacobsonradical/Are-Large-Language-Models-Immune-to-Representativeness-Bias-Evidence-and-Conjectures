To find the posterior odds, we'll first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                  = 35 * (1/27) + 20 * (1/81)
                  = 1.3 * (1/9)

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(7, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                  = 20 * (1/27) + 35 * (1/81)
                  = 0.73 * (1/9)

Now, we have the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (1.3 * (1/9)) / (0.73 * (1/9)) = 1.3 / 0.73 â‰ˆ 1.8

Finally, we'll calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = L * P(A) / P(B)
          = (1.8) * ((2/3) / (1/3)) / ((1/3) / (2/3))
          = 1.8 * 2 * 2 = 7.2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 7.2 to 1 compared to Deck B.
