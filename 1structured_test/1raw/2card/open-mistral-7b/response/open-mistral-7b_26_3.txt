To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probabilities for Deck A:

1. The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck A is 2/3.
2. Since there are 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 drawn cards, the probability of drawing the first X is 2/3, the second X is (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3, and the third X is (2/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. The probability of drawing the O is (1/3)*(2/2) = 2/3.
3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 8/2187.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:

1. The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck B is 1/3.
2. Since there are 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 drawn cards, the probability of drawing the first X is 1/3, the second X is (1/3)*(2/2) = 2/3, and the third X is (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9. The probability of drawing the O is (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/2.
3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/2) = 8/362.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 8/2187 / 8/362 = 362/2187 â‰ˆ 0.1658}

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.1658 to 1.
