To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(10, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(10, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(15, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(15, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(15, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

odds = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

You can substitute the probabilities calculated above to find the numerical value of the odds.
