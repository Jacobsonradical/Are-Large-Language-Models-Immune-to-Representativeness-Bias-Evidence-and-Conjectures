To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2
   Simplifying this expression gives us: P(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0972

2. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(12, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
   Simplifying this expression gives us: P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.1512

Now we can calculate the odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0972 / 0.1512 ≈ 0.648}

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.648, meaning it is slightly more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
