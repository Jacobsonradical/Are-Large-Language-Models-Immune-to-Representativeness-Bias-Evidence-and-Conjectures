To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then calculate the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing a single card marked X is 2/3.
The probability of drawing a single card marked O is 1/3.
Given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O, the number of ways to do this is C(12,3) * C(12,1) = 220 * 12 = 2640.
So, P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 2640 / C(24,4)

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing a single card marked X is 1/3.
The probability of drawing a single card marked O is 2/3.
Given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O, the number of ways to do this is C(16,3) * C(16,1) = 560 * 16 = 8960.
So, P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 8960 / C(32,4)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)}

Note that you might need to use a calculator to find the exact value of the probabilities and the odds.
