To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability beliefs after observing data. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- E: the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B

We know the prior probabilities:
P(A) = 1/2 (since there's an equal chance of drawing from either deck)
P(B) = 1/2

We also know the probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) (since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X and 1/3 are O)
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) (since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X and 2/3 are O)

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Calculate the numerator:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)

Calculate the denominator:
[(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] + [((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) * ((1/2))]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator.

After calculating the exact values, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 4.59 to 1.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4.59}
