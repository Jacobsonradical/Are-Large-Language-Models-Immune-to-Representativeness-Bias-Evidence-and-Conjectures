To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B, given that 4 cards have been drawn.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O|A) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O|B).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):
Since there are 4 cards, we can choose 3X cards in C(10, 3) ways and 1O card in C(10, 1) ways. Then, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(10, 3) * C(7, 1) / C(20, 4)

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):
Since there are 4 cards, we can choose 3X cards in C(6, 3) ways and 1O card in C(14, 1) ways. Then, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(6, 3) * C(14, 1) / C(20, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|A) + P(3X, 1O|B)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) / P(3X, 1O|A) + P(3X, 1O|B)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}
