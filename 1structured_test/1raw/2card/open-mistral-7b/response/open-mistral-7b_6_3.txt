To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B. The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A (A) is given by the following binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B (B) is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we know that one of the decks was drawn and 3X and 1O were drawn. The probability of this event occurring for each deck is the product of the probability of drawing 3X and 1O and the probability of drawing Deck A or Deck B:

P(3X, 1O and A) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)

P(3X, 1O and B) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

The prior probability of drawing Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is 1/2:

P(A) = 1/2
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X, 1O and A) / P(3X, 1O and B)

Substitute the probabilities:

L = (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) * (1/2))

Simplify the expression:

L = (1620 / 1458) / (56 * (1/2))

L = 1620 / 729

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds:

odds = L * P(A) / P(B)
odds = (1620 / 729) * (1/2) / (1/2)

Simplify the expression:

odds = 1620 / 729

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1620/729.
