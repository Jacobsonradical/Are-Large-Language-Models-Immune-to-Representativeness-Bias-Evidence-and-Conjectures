To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B, given that we have drawn 4 cards with these characteristics.

Let's first find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck A = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck A = 1/3

   - Probability of drawing 3X and 1O in 4 draws from Deck A = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)

2. Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing a single X from Deck B = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing a single O from Deck B = 2/3

   - Probability of drawing 3X and 1O in 4 draws from Deck B = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (Probability of Deck A given 3X and 1O) / (Probability of Deck B given 3X and 1O)}

= ({Probability of 3X and 1O in 4 draws from Deck A} / Total probability of 4 draws from Deck A) / ({Probability of 3X and 1O in 4 draws from Deck B} / Total probability of 4 draws from Deck B)

= ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) / ((1/3)^4 * (2/3) + (2/3)^4 * (1/3))

= (2^3 / 3^7) / (2^4 / 3^7) / (1/3 + 1/81)

= (8 / 3^4) / (2 / 3^4) / (1/3 + 1/81)

= (8 / 2) / (1 / 27) * (3^4 / (1 + 1/81))

= 4 * 27 * (3^4 / 82)

= 36864 / 82

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 455.76. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is about 456 times more likely than Deck B as the source of the drawn cards.
