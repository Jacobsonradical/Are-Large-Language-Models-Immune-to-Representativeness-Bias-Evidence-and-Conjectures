To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):
P(3X, 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1
           = (220 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) + (792 * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1)
           = (220 * (1/27)) + (792 * (1/81))
           = (88/27) + (984/81)
           = 1012/81

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1
           = (84 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) + (216 * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1)
           = (84 * (1/27)) + (216 * (1/81))
           = (84/27) + (216/81)
           = 300/81

Now we can calculate the prior odds (P(A)/P(B)) and the likelihood ratio (P(3X, 1O|A)/P(3X, 1O|B)):

Prior odds: P(A)/P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2
Likelihood ratio: P(3X, 1O|A)/P(3X, 1O|B) = 1012/81 / 300/81

The posterior odds are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
                = 2 * (1012/81) / (300/81)
                = 2 * (1012/300)
                = 1012/150

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1012/150.
