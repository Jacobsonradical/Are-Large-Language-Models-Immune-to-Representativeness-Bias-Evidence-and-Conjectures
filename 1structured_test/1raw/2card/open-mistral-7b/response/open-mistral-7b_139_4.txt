To calculate the posterior odds, we need to determine the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 1/21

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Now, let's calculate P(A) and P(B):

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1

We can assume equal prior probabilities since the decks were chosen at random.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem:

odds = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

odds = [(1/21) * 1] / [(4/27) * 1]

odds = 1/4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1/4. This means that Deck B is four times more likely to have been the source of the 4 cards, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
