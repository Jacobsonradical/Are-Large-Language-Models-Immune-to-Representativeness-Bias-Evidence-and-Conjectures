To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck A as A_X and A_O, respectively, and the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B as B_X and B_O, respectively.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(A_X=3, A_O=1 | Deck A) = C(10,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:

P(B_X=3, B_O=1 | Deck B) = C(13,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = {odds: [P(A_X=3, A_O=1 | Deck A) / P(B_X=3, B_O=1 | Deck B)]}

To simplify the calculation, we can find the ratio of the probabilities:

{odds: [(C(10,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(13,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)]} = {odds: [(120 * (2/27)) / (286 * (1/27))]} = {odds: (120 / 286) * (27 / 1)} = {odds: 120 / 286}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 120/286.
