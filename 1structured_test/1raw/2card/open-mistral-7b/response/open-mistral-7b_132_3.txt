To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A versus Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event of drawing the cards from Deck A
- B as the event of drawing the cards from Deck B
- X3O1 as the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O

We know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), and the likelihood P(X3O1|A) and P(X3O1|B).

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1/2
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1/2

Now, calculate the likelihoods:
P(X3O1|A) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/243 ≈ 0.0327
P(X3O1|B) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27 ≈ 0.2963

Now, calculate the posterior probabilities (P(A|X3O1) and P(B|X3O1)):
P(A|X3O1) = P(X3O1|A) * P(A) / (P(X3O1|A) * P(A) + P(X3O1|B) * P(B))
P(B|X3O1) = P(X3O1|B) * P(B) / (P(X3O1|A) * P(A) + P(X3O1|B) * P(B))

Calculate the numerator of P(A|X3O1):
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2) = 8/288 ≈ 0.0028

Calculate the numerator of P(B|X3O1):
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2) = 8/81 ≈ 0.0989

Calculate the denominator:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2) = 8/288 + 8/81 ≈ 0.0806

Calculate P(A|X3O1):
0.0028 / 0.0806 ≈ 0.0346

Calculate P(B|X3O1):
0.0989 / 0.0806 ≈ 1.23

Finally, calculate the odds:
{odds: 0.0346 / 1.23 ≈ 0.0281}

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.0281:1. This means that Deck B is about 35 times more likely than Deck A given the observed data.
