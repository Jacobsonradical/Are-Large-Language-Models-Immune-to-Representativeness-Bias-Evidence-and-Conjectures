To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(26, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^(26-4)]

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(36, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(36-4)]

Now, we know that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 2:1 (since Deck A has twice as many X's as Deck B). Let's denote these prior odds as O(A/B) = 2.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:

O(A/B|3X, 1O) = O(A/B) * P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Plugging in the probabilities, we get:

O(A/B|3X, 1O) = 2 * [C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplifying this gives us:

O(A/B|3X, 1O) = (16/27) / (2/27) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is 8 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
