To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for Deck A and Deck B separately:

1. For Deck A:
   The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula:

   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

   Where C(12, 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 X's from 12 (which is 220), and (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the deck.

2. For Deck B:
   The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula:

   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

   Where C(18, 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 X's from 18 (which is 1,365), and (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the deck.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = {P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)}

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier:

{odds: (220 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (1,365 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)}

To simplify this, we can use the fact that (2/3)^3 = (1/3)^3, and (1/3)^1 = (1/3)^3 * (1/3)^0. Then, we get:

{odds: (220 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1) / (1,365 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2)}

{odds: (220) / (2,730)}

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.8072 to 1.
