To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B respectively.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

P(3X,1O | A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
             = 220 * (1/27)
             = 8 * (1/3)
             = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X,1O | B) = C(18,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
             = 1814 * (1/27)
             = 66 * (1/3)
             = 22 * (1/3)

Now, we can calculate the prior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B:

P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

The likelihood ratio is given by the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X,1O | A) / P(3X,1O | B) = 8/27 / 22/27
                      = 2/3

The posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = P(A) / P(B) * Likelihood Ratio
                = 2 * (2/3)
                = 4/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4/3.
