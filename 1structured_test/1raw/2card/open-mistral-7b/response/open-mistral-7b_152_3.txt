To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A, which is the same for both decks, so it cancels out when we calculate the odds.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1 = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = 4/27

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O|A) * P(B) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)
                  = (8/27) / (8/27 + 4/27)
                  = 8/12

P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)
                  = (4/27) / (8/27 + 4/27)
                  = 4/12

The odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 8/4} = 2:1

So the odds are 2 to 1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
