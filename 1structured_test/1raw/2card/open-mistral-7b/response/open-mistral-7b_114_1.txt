To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 / 27
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 440 / 27

Now, let's find the prior odds:

P(A) = Number of ways to choose Deck A / Total number of decks
     = 1 / (1 + 1)
     = 1 / 2

P(B) = 1 - P(A)
         = 1 / 2

The prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 2

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 220 / 440
                                           = 11 / 22

Finally, the posterior odds are:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = L * P(A) / P(B)
                                             = (11/22) * (1/2) / (1/2)
                                             = 11 / 22

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 11:22.
