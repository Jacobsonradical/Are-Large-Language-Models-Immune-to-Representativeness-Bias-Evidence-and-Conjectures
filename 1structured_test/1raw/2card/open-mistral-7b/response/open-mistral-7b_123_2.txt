To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B independently. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (C(36, 4))

Where C(n, r) represents the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.0749

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(27, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / (C(36, 4))

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.1622

Now, we can calculate the odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.0749 / 0.1622 ≈ 0.4614

So, given that 3 Xs and 1 O were drawn, the odds that these cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, are approximately 0.46 to 1 that they were drawn from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
