To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck A as P(A|3X,1O) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck A:
P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O)

In deck A, there are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O is the probability of drawing 3X's followed by 1O:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 4 cards from deck A is:
P(A) = (2/3)^4

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck B:
P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X,1O)

In deck B, there are 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3X's and 1O is the probability of drawing 3X's followed by 1O:
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

The probability of drawing 4 cards from deck B is:
P(B) = (1/3)^4 * 3

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(A) * P(3X,1O|A)) / (P(B) * P(3X,1O|B))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4 to 1. In other words, the probability is 4 times higher that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
