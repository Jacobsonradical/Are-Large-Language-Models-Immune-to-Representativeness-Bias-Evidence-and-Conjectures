To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

We know that the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X,1O|A) = C(7,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(26,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X,1O|B) = C(20,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(10,1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Now, let's denote the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B as P(A) and P(B), respectively. Since we're given that one deck is chosen at random, we have P(A) + P(B) = 1.

We want to find the posterior odds:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [P(A) * P(3X,1O|A)] / [P(B) * P(3X,1O|B)]

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of P(A) and P(B). To proceed, we can assume that the selection of the deck is equally likely (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), or use other assumptions based on additional context if available.

Under this assumption, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 0.5 * P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B)}

Please note that without knowing the exact values of P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B), we can't provide a numerical value for the posterior odds. You would need to calculate these probabilities or make other assumptions to obtain a specific number.
