To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let L(A) be the likelihood of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A, and L(B) be the likelihood of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B.

Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 1/6.

Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O is (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 1/12.

Now, let P(A) be the prior probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the prior probability of drawing from Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The posterior odds are given by:

{odds: L(A) / L(B)} = {1/6 / 1/12} = {1/2}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2.
