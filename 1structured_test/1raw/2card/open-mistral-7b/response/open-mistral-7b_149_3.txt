To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then multiply it by the prior odds, which is the probability of each deck being selected.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                          = 220/273

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 1080 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                          = 1080/273

Now, let's assume the prior probability of drawing Deck A or Deck B is equal, so the prior odds are 1.

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A are:
Odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                             = (220/273) / (1080/273)
                             = 220/1080
                             = 1/5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1/5.
