To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

Prior odds (Deck A : Deck B) = Probability of Deck A / Probability of Deck B

Let's denote the probability of Deck A as P(A) and the probability of Deck B as P(B).

Given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, we can calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, given that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O, we can calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws as follows:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's find the prior odds:

P(A) = P(Deck A was drawn)
P(B) = P(Deck B was drawn)

Since the decks were selected at random, we assume that they have equal probability:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the prior odds:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's find the likelihood of the observed data, given each deck:

Likelihood(3X, 1O | A) = P(3X, 1O | A)
Likelihood(3X, 1O | B) = P(3X, 1O | B)

Using the formulas from above, we can calculate the likelihoods:

Likelihood(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
Likelihood(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood(3X, 1O | A) / Likelihood(3X, 1O | B)

After calculating the values, the answer is:

{odds: 1.47}

This means that, given the observed data, there is about 1.47 times more evidence that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B. However, this is not a definitive answer since the actual probabilities might differ depending on the exact distribution of marked X and O cards within the decks.
