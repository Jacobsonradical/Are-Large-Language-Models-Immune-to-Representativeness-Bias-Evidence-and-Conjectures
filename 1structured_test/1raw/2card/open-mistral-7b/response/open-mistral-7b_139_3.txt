To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as X3O1.

For Deck A:
P(X3O1 | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

For Deck B:
P(X3O1 | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | X3O1) / P(Deck B | X3O1)

Using Bayes' theorem:

odds = [P(X3O1 | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(X3O1 | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

Substituting the probabilities:

odds = [(10*1/3*1/52) / (52*2/3*1/52)] / [(18*1/3*2/52) / (52*2/3*1/52)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

odds = 10 * 2 / 18

odds = 5/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 5/9.
