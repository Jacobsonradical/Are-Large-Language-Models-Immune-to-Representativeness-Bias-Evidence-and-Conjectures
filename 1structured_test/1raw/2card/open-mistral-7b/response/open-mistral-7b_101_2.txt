To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O):

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(draw 3X, 1O from Deck A) / P(draw any 4 cards from Deck A)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as:

P(3X, 1O from Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                 = 220 * (1/27)
                                 = 8 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing any 4 cards from Deck A is:

P(any 4 cards from Deck A) = C(36, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^(36-4)
                                         = C(36, 4) * (1/81)

So, P(A|3X, 1O) = 8/(3 \* C(36, 4))

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O):

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(draw 3X, 1O from Deck B) / P(draw any 4 cards from Deck B)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as:

P(3X, 1O from Deck B) = C(27, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                 = 840 * (1/27)
                                 = 8 \* (4/3)

The probability of drawing any 4 cards from Deck B is:

P(any 4 cards from Deck B) = C(54, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(54-4)
                                         = C(54, 4) * (1/81)

So, P(B|3X, 1O) = 8 / (3 \* C(54, 4))

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Substituting the values, we get:

LR = (8/(3 \* C(36, 4))) / (8 / (3 \* C(54, 4)))

Since C(36, 4) and C(54, 4) are both very large constants, we can approximate the likelihood ratio as:

LR â‰ˆ 1

Since the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B is 2:1, the posterior odds would be the same as the likelihood ratio times the prior odds:

Posterior odds = LR \* Prior odds
                         = 1 \* 2
                         = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2 to 1.
