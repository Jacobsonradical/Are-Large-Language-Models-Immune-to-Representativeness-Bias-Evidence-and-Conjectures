To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the data (3X and 1O) under Deck A and Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (3! / (3 * 1!))
                            = (8/27) * (1/3) * 6
                            = 8/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (3! / (3 * 1!))
                            = (1/27) * (2/3) * 6
                            = 4/81

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = (8/81) / (4/81)
     = 2

The posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2:1.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 2}

This means that, given the observed data, there is twice as much evidence supporting the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as there is supporting the hypothesis that they were drawn from Deck B.
