To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability that the deck drawn is Deck A and P(B) be the probability that the deck drawn is Deck B.

We can find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(13, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

{odds: P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)} = {P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)}

Substituting the probabilities we calculated, we get:

{odds: [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 2/3] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 1/3]}

This simplifies to:

{odds: 8/27}

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, is 8/27.
