To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1
                     = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                     = 220 * (1/81)
                     = 22/243

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1
                     = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                     = 220 * (2/243)
                     = 44/243

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of drawing a card from Deck A is P(A), and the prior probability of drawing a card from Deck B is P(B) = 1 - P(A).

The posterior probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, is:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

The posterior probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) + P(B) = 1, we can write the posterior odds as:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

odds = [(22/243) * P(A)] / [(44/243) * (1 - P(A))]

Since we don't have the value of P(A), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can see that the posterior odds will favor Deck A if P(A) > 1/2, and Deck B if P(A) < 1/2.
