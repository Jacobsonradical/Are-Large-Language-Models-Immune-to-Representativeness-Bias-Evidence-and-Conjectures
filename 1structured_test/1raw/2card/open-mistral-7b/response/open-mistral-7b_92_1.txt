To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (1/36)
                             = 220 * 1/1089
                             = 1/5

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(33, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(33, 1) * (2/3)^1
                             = 1166 * (1/81) * (1/33)
                             = 1166 * 1/10667
                             = 1/93

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = (1/5) / (1/93)
     = 93/5

Finally, if the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B is 2:1, the posterior odds can be calculated as:
{odds: 93}

This means that, given the observed data, the odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) is approximately 93 times higher than the odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck B (where most cards are marked O).
