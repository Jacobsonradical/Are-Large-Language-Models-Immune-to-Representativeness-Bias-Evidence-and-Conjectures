To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B. The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|E) is the posterior probability of Deck A given the event E (drawing 3X and 1O cards)
- P(E|A) is the likelihood of the event E given Deck A
- P(A) is the prior probability of Deck A

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the event E:

1. Prior probabilities:
   P(A) = 0.5 (since we don't know which deck was drawn, but we know that each deck has a 1/2 chance of being drawn)
   P(B) = 0.5

2. Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards:
   In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards is C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^1
   In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards is C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^1

3. Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Calculate the numerator and denominator, and then divide:

{odds: [(486/1728) * 0.5] / [(486/1728) * 0.5 + (243/1728) * 0.5]} = {odds: 0.28125 / (0.28125 + 0.140625)} = {odds: 0.28125 / 0.421875} â‰ˆ {odds: 0.667}

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 0.667 to 1. This means that, given the event of drawing 3X and 1O cards, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B. However, the odds are not strongly in favor of Deck A, as the result is close to 1, indicating equal likelihood of either deck.
