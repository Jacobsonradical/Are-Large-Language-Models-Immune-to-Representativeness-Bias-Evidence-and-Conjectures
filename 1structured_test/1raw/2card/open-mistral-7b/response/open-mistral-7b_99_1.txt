To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the deck is A, and B represent the event that the deck is B. Let X_i represent the event that the i-th drawn card is marked X, and O_i represent the event that the i-th drawn card is marked O.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A is:
P(X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4 | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B is:
P(X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4 | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

The prior probability of Deck A being selected is:
P(A) = 1/2

The prior probability of Deck B being selected is:
P(B) = 1/2

The likelihood ratio is:
L = P(X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4 | A) / P(X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4 | B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/3

The posterior probability of Deck A being the selected deck is:
P(A | X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4) = P(A) * L = (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3

The posterior probability of Deck B being the selected deck is:
P(B | X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4) = P(B) * (1/L) = (1/2) * (3/2) = 3/4

Now, we can calculate the odds:
odds = P(A | X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4) / P(B | X_1 ∩ X_2 ∩ X_3 ∩ O_4) = (1/3) / (3/4) = 1/4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/4.
