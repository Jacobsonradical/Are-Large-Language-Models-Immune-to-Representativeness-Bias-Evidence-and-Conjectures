To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                             = 220/273

Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                             = 196 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                             = 196/273

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                            = (220/273) * (1/2) / [(220/273) * (1/2) + (196/273) * (1/2)]
                            = 220/546

P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                            = (196/273) * (1/2) / [(220/273) * (1/2) + (196/273) * (1/2)]
                            = 196/546

Now, calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = (220/546) / (196/546)
      = 220/196
      = 11/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 11:9 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
