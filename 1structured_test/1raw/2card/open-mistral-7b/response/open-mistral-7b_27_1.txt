To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(3X_A, 1O_A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Where C(13, 3) is the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 13 X's in Deck A.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(3X_B, 1O_B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Where C(10, 3) is the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 10 X's in Deck B.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A | 3X_A, 1O_A) / P(B | 3X_A, 1O_A)

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:

P(A) = 1/2
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratios:

L(A | 3X_A, 1O_A) = P(3X_A, 1O_A | A) / P(3X_A, 1O_A | B)

L(B | 3X_A, 1O_A) = P(3X_A, 1O_A | B) / P(3X_A, 1O_A | A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

L(A | 3X_A, 1O_A) = [C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
L(B | 3X_A, 1O_A) = [C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)] / [C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = L(A | 3X_A, 1O_A) * P(A) / L(B | 3X_A, 1O_A) * P(B)

After calculating the values, the answer is:

{odds: 2.32}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is about 2.32 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
