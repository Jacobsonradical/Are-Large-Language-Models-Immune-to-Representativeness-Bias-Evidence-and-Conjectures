To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 2/3 of the deck and 1 O out of 1/3 of the deck. This can be calculated as:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) = (2/3! * 3!) * ((1/3)! * 1!) = (2 / 6) * (1 / 1) = 1/6

Similarly, for Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) = (1/3! * 3!) * ((2/3)! * 1!) = (1 / 6) * (2 / 1) = 1/3

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior probabilities are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

The posterior odds can now be calculated as the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
                      = (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))
                      = (1/6 * 1/2) / (1/3 * 1/2)
                      = 1/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/9. This means that Deck B is 9 times more likely than Deck A, given the observed data. However, since the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B were equal, this result may seem counterintuitive. This is an example of the "base rate fallacy," where the prior probability significantly affects the posterior probability. In this case, the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B was not informative, and the data led to a result that contradicts our intuition.
