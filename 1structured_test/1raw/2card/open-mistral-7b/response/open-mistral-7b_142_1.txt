To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck A and B, and then find the likelihood ratio between the two.

Prior probability (Deck A):
P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A
P(3X and 1O | A) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A

P(A) = 1 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)

P(3X and 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
P(3X and 1O | A) ≈ 0.012 + 0.064 + 0.096 ≈ 0.172

Prior probability (Deck B):
P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B
P(3X and 1O | B) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B

P(B) = 1

P(3X and 1O | B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(16, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(16, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
P(3X and 1O | B) ≈ 0.008 + 0.016 + 0.016 ≈ 0.036

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B) ≈ 0.172 / 0.036 ≈ 4.83

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior probability(Deck A) / Prior probability(Deck B)
Posterior odds ≈ 4.83 * 1 / 1 = 4.83

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 4.83. This means that the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A is about 4.83 times higher than drawing from Deck B, given the observable event of drawing 3X and 1O.
