To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. We'll first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then take the ratio.

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = P(3X | Deck A) * P(1O | Deck A)
                                = (C(n=4, k=3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) * (C(n=4, k=1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3))
                                = (4!) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (4!) * (1/81) * (2/3)
                                = (8) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (8) * (2/81)
                                = 256/12243

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = P(3X | Deck B) * P(1O | Deck B)
                                = (C(n=4, k=3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) * (C(n=4, k=1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3))
                                = (4!) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (4!) * (2/81) * (1/3)
                                = (8) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (8) * (2/81) * (1/3)
                                = 256/12243

Since the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from both decks are equal, the likelihood ratio is 1. Therefore, the posterior odds remain the same as the prior odds, and they are:

{odds: 1}

This means that, given the observed data, there is no evidence to favor either Deck A or Deck B over the other. However, it's important to note that drawing four cards without replacement from such large decks may not be statistically meaningful, and larger sample sizes would be required for a more conclusive result.
