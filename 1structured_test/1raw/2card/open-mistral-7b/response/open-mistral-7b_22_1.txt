To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of the observed event (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) given Deck A and Deck B. We'll first find the probabilities of this event for each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O):

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards:
   Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from 12: C(12, 4)
   P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 4) * P(3X, 1O | A)

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O):

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | B) = C(15, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(15, 1) * (2/3)^12

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 15 cards:
   Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from 15: C(15, 4)
   P(3X, 1O) = C(15, 4) * P(3X, 1O | B)

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

To find the actual odds, we multiply the posterior odds by the prior odds (the probability of Deck A being selected before drawing any cards). Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds are 1.

So the actual odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)} * 1

Note that the actual odds depend on the specific values of C(12, 4) and C(15, 4), which are combinations of 4 items chosen from 12 and 15, respectively. You can calculate these values using the formula for combinations.
