To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a total of 4 X's and 12 non-X's in Deck A, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * C(12, 1) / C(48, 4)

where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a total of 4 X's and 24 non-X's in Deck B, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * C(24, 1) / C(52, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing these probabilities:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

By calculating these probabilities and dividing them, you can find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
