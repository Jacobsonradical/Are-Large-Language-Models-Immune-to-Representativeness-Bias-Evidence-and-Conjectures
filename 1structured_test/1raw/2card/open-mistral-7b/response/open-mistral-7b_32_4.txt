To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide the former by the latter.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a card with X from Deck A as pAx and the probability of drawing a card with X from Deck B as pBx. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we have pAx = 2/3 and pAo = 1/3. Similarly, since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we have pBx = 1/3 and pBo = 2/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by (pAx)^3 * pAo, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by (pBx)^3 * pBo.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (pAx^3 * pAo) / ((pBx)^3 * pBo)}

Substituting the values for pAx, pAo, pBx, and pBo, we get:

{odds: ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))}

Simplifying the expression, we get:

{odds: 8/27}
