To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide the former by the latter.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing a single X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243.

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing a single X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Likelihood(Deck A) / Likelihood(Deck B)
                      = (8/243) / (2/81)
                      = 4 * (2/3) / (1)
                      = 8/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8/3.
