To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2
                      = (220) * (1/27) * (1) * (252) * (1/9) * (4/9)
                      = (220 * 252) * (1/27 * 9 * 4)
                      = (55616) * (1/243)
                      â‰ˆ 0.223

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^2
                      = (1530) * (1/27) * (1) * (18) * (1/9) * (1/9)
                      = (1530 * 18) * (1/27 * 9 * 1)
                      = (27420) * (1/27)
                      = 1014 * (1/1)
                      = 1014

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 0.223 / 1014}

Answer: {odds: 0.00022} (approximately)
