To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A versus Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's as O_A. Similarly, let X_B and O_B be the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 51, 3) * (1/3 * 51)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial probability:

P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * (2/3 * 52)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
     = [(C(2/3 * 51, 3) * (1/3 * 51)^1) * (2/3)] / [(C(1/3 * 52, 3) * (2/3 * 52)^1) * (1/3)]

Calculate the values of the binomial coefficients and multiply the quantities to get the final answer.
