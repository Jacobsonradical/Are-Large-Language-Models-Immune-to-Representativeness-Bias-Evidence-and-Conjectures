To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) and P(B) be the probabilities of drawing from deck A and deck B respectively. We are given that P(A) = 2/5 and P(B) = 1/2.

Let P(3X1O|A) and P(3X1O|B) be the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the deck is A or B respectively.

We are given that P(3X1O|A) = C(7,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 35/288 = 5/48
and P(3X1O|B) = C(12,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 84/576 = 7/48

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: 5/48 / 7/48 = 5/28}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 5 to 28 compared to deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
