To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we know that the probability of Deck A or Deck B being selected is equal. Let's denote this probability as P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)
     = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
     = (2/3) / (2/3)
     = 1

So, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1:1, or in other words, there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other based on this data.
