To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = P(X)^3 * P(O | X, Deck A) * P(X)^1 * P(O | Deck A) * P(O | Deck A)
   P(X) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A = 2/3
   P(O | X, Deck A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A - Number of X cards in Deck A = 1/3
   So, P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3)

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = P(X)^3 * P(O | X, Deck B) * P(X)^1 * P(O | Deck B) * P(O | Deck B)
   P(X) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B = 1/3
   P(O | X, Deck B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B - Number of X cards in Deck B = 2/3
   So, P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
               = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
               = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3))
               = (2/3)^3 / (2/3)^3
               = 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1:1, which means there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other based on the given data.
