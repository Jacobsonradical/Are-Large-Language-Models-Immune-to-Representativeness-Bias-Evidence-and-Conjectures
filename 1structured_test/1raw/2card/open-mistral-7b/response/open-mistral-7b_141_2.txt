To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * C(18, 1) / C(30, 4) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                        = 220 * 1/1062
                        ≈ 0.206

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(9, 3) * C(18, 1) / C(36, 4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                        = 126 * 1/1260
                        ≈ 0.101

The likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B is:
L(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                         ≈ 0.206 / 0.101
                         ≈ 2.04

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of Deck A and Deck B being chosen is equal, P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2. The posterior odds are then:

odds = L(Deck A | 3X, 1O) * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)
      = (2.04) * (1/2) / (1/2)
      = 2.04

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is approximately 2.04 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
