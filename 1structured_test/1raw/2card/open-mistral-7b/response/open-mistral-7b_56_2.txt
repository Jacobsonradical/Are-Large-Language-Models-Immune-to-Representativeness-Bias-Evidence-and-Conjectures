To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Since P(3X,1O|A) = P(3X,1O|B), the likelihoods do not help us distinguish between the two decks.

However, we have prior probabilities for each deck:
P(A) = Probability of selecting deck A
P(B) = Probability of selecting deck B

Given that we are selecting a deck at random, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) * P(A)) / (P(B|3X,1O) * P(B))
                     = (P(A) * P(3X,1O|A)) / (P(B) * P(3X,1O|B))
                     = (1/2 * 8/27) / (1/2 * 8/27)
                     = 1

Since the posterior odds are equal to 1, we cannot say with certainty that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B. The data does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

Final answer: {odds: 1}
