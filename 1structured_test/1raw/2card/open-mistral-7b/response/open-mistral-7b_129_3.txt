To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * (44) * (1/9) * (2/3)
                        = 220 * (2/267)
                        = 440 / 267

Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                        = 1530 * (1/27) * (1/2) * (18) * (1/9) * (1/2)
                        = 1530 * (1/54)
                        = 28 * 1/9
                        = 28/9

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of these two probabilities:

{odds: 440/267 : 28/9}

To simplify the odds, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 14:

{odds: 31 : 2}
