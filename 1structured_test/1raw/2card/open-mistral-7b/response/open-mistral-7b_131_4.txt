To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/216
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Now, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) of drawing from each deck:

P(A) = Number of ways to draw 4 cards from A with 3X and 1O / Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from A
     = C(12,3) * C(9,1) / C(21,4)
     = 220 / 2806

P(B) = Number of ways to draw 4 cards from B with 3X and 1O / Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from B
     = C(12,3) * C(9,1) / C(18,4)
     = 220 / 1731

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (8/216) / (8/243) * (220/2806) / (220/1731)
      = (216 * 1731) / (243 * 2806)
      = 381861 / 701902
      = 0.5437

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.5437 to 1, or 0.5437:1 that they were drawn from Deck A.
