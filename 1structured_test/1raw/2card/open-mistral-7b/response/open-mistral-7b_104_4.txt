To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Prior probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from a deck where 2/3 are X and 1/3 are O is the number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from 2/3 X cards and 1/3 O cards, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck.

C(2/3 * 27, 3) represents choosing 3X from 2/3 * 52 (since each X is counted twice) cards.
C(1/3 * 52, 1) represents choosing 1O from 1/3 * 52 cards.

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 52 is C(52, 4).

So, the prior probability P(Deck A|3X and 1O) = (C(2/3 * 27, 3) * C(1/3 * 52, 1)) / C(52, 4)

Prior probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
Similarly, we can calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from a deck where 1/3 are X and 2/3 are O.

The number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from 1/3 X cards and 2/3 O cards is C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1).

The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 52 is still C(52, 4).

So, the prior probability P(Deck B|3X and 1O) = (C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1)) / C(52, 4)

Now, we can find the posterior odds by calculating the ratio of the prior probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A|3X and 1O) / P(Deck B|3X and 1O)

Using a calculator to compute the prior probabilities and the odds:

{odds: 2.33}

So, given that 3X and 1O cards were drawn, the odds that they were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 2.33 times the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
