To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

After calculating, the likelihood ratio is approximately 1.43

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds, which is 1 in this case (since we don't have any prior information), so:

{odds: 1.43}
