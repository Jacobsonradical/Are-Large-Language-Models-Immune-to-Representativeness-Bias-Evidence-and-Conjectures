To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

The prior odds are the odds of drawing from Deck A before observing the cards. Since there are two possible decks and Deck A has more X cards, it's more likely to draw from Deck A. The probability of drawing from Deck A is 1/2, and the probability of drawing from Deck B is also 1/2.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = 286

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 120

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratios for both decks:

LR(Deck A) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                  = 286 / 120
                  = 2.4

Since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

odds = LR(Deck A) * prior odds
        = 2.4 * 1
        = 2.4

So, the posterior odds are 2.4 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
