To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (1! * 1!) = 1/21

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (2! * 2!) = 1/42

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 1/21 / 1/42 = 42/21

The posterior odds are given by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds. Since we don't have prior odds, we'll assume they're 1:

Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds = 42/21

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is 42/21.
