To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 7 X's and 4 O's (total of 11 cards), divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 11:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(7, 3) * C(4, 1) / C(11, 4)
              = 35 * 4 / 165
              = 56 / 165

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 4 X's and 8 O's (total of 12 cards), divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 12:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) * C(8, 1) / C(12, 4)
              = 4 * 8 / 495
              = 32 / 495

Now, we know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Let's assume these are known or can be estimated based on some other information:

P(A) = some value > 0
P(B) = 1 - P(A)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the likelihood of drawing from Deck A by the likelihood of drawing from Deck B:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}

It's important to note that the values for P(A) and P(B) are not provided in the question, so I'm unable to provide a specific numerical answer. You'll need to use these probabilities based on your knowledge or assumptions about the relative frequencies of drawing from each deck.
