To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck A with the specified marks:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(3, 3) * C(1, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(4-3-1) * (1/3)^(4-3)
          = (6) * (1) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (1/3)^2 * (1/9)
          = 1/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, multiplied by the probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck B with the specified marks:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(3, 3) * C(1, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(4-3-1) * (2/3)^(4-3)
          = (6) * (1) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (1/3)^2 * (2/9)
          = 1/9

Now, let's denote the prior probability of Deck A as P(A) and the prior probability of Deck B as P(B). Since the decks are selected at random, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
     = (1/27) / (1/9)
     = 1/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/3. This means that, given the observed data, Deck B is twice as likely as Deck A to have been the source of the drawn cards. However, since the prior probability of Deck A was equal to the prior probability of Deck B, the data slightly favors Deck B, but not significantly.
