To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and divide it by the likelihood of drawing the same number of X's and O's from Deck B.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn as x and the number of O's drawn as y.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using combinations as follows:

C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 * (1/27) = 8

Similarly, for Deck B:

C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 220 * (1/27) = 8

However, since the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the same for both decks, the odds are determined by the prior probabilities of the decks:

P(A) = 1 (since we assume both decks are equally likely to be drawn at random)
P(B) = 1

Thus, the odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A are:

{odds: 1}

This result might seem counterintuitive, as one might expect the odds to favor Deck A, which has more X-marked cards. However, given the information provided, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the same for both decks, and hence the odds are 1:1.

This result highlights the importance of considering both the likelihood of the observed event and the prior probabilities of the hypotheses. In this case, the prior probabilities are equal, and therefore the odds are also equal, despite the fact that Deck A has more X-marked cards.
