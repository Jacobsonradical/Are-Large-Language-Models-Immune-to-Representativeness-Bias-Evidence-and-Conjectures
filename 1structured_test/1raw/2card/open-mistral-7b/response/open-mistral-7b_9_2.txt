To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck, then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3X and 1O cards from deck A as A31, and the event of drawing 3X and 1O cards from deck B as B31.

The probability of A31 occurring is given by the number of ways to choose 3X and 1O cards from deck A divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from deck A:

P(A31) = C(6, 3) * C(12, 1) / C(48, 4)

where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, the probability of B31 occurring is given by:

P(B31) = C(18, 3) * C(12, 1) / C(48, 4)

Now, we have the prior probabilities of drawing from deck A and deck B:

P(A) = 2/3
P(B) = 1/3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|A31) / P(B|A31)

We can write the numerator as:

P(A|A31) = P(A31|A) * P(A) / P(A31)

And the denominator as:

P(B|A31) = P(A31|B) * P(B) / P(A31)

Since P(A31) is common to both numerator and denominator, we can cancel it out:

odds = [P(A31|A) * P(A)] / [P(A31|B) * P(B)]

Since A31 is dependent only on the deck chosen, we can write:

P(A31|A) = P(A31)
P(A31|B) = 0 (since it's impossible to draw 3X and 1O from deck B with this probability distribution)

So, the posterior odds are:

odds = (P(A) * P(A31)) / (0 * P(B))

odds = (2/3) / (0)

Since the denominator is zero, the odds are undefined in this situation. This means that given the observation of 3X and 1O cards, it's impossible to draw a conclusion about whether the cards were drawn from deck A or deck B based on this information. This is because the probability distribution of deck B does not allow for the observed event to occur.
