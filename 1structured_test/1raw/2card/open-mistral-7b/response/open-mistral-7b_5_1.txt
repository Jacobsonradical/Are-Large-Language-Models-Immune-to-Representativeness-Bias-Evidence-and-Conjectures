To calculate the posterior odds, we need to first calculate the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Prior odds: Deck A is chosen over Deck B = Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A / Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B

Ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A = C(2/3 * 52, 3) * C(1/3 * 52, 1)
Ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1)

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A = (C(2/3 * 52, 3) * C(1/3 * 52, 1)) / (C(52, 4))
Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B = (C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1)) / (C(52, 4))

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B

Plug in the values and calculate:

{odds: 1.515}
