To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|data), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|data).

First, let's calculate P(A|data). Since Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, the probability of drawing a single X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243.

Next, let's calculate P(B|data). Since Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, the probability of drawing a single X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 1/81.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/243) / (1/81) = 8/81

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is LR = 8/81.
