To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B, given the observed data.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * C(13, 1) / C(26, 4)
                            = 286 * 13 / 1820
                            = 7 * 1/16

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * C(16, 1) / C(26, 4)
                            = 120 * 16 / 1820
                            = 2 * 1/10

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = (7/16) / (2/10)
    = 14 / 2
    = 7

Since the prior odds are 1 (since we don't have any prior information), the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 7}
