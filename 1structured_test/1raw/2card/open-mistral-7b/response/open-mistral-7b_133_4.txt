To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

Given that in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Given that in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) of drawing from Deck A and Deck B respectively. Since the choice of the deck is random, we assume that both decks have an equal chance of being selected.

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

odds(A|3X, 1O) = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier, we get:

odds(A|3X, 1O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

odds(A|3X, 1O) = (8/27) / (1/27) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 8 times higher than drawing from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
