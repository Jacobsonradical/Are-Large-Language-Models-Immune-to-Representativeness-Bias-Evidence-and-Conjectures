To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide the probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                         = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 24 * (2/9)
                         = 220 * (2/81)
                         = 220/324

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                         = 8 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 36 * (1/9)
                         = 8 * (2/81)
                         = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = (220/324) / (8/81)
     = 220 * 81 / (324 * 8)
     = 220 / 24
     = 11/12

So, the posterior odds are 11/12 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
