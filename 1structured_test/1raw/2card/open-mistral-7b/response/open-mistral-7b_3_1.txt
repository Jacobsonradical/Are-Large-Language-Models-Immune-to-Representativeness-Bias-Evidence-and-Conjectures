To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then divide them. Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as N.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(N-1, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(N-1, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(N-1, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(N-1, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3

The odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)}

Note that the exact numerical value of the odds depends on the total number of cards in the decks (N). To find a specific value, you need to substitute N in the above expressions and calculate the ratios.
