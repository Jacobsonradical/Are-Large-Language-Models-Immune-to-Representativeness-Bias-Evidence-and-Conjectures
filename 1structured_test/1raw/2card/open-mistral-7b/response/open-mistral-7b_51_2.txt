To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

Let's denote the number of cards in both decks as N (assuming they are of the same size for simplicity).

Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(N/3, 3) * C(2/3*N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(N/3, 3) * C(2/3*N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Since both decks have the same number of cards, N, and the probabilities of drawing X and O are the same, these two probabilities are equal.

The prior odds are 2:1 (Deck A has a 2/3 chance of being chosen, Deck B has a 1/3 chance).

The posterior odds are the prior odds times the likelihood ratio (which is 1 in this case):

odds = 2 * 1 = 2

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2 to 1, compared to Deck B.
