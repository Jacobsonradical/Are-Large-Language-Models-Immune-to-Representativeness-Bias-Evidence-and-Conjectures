To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the odds of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the odds of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

Probability(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items.

Probability(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0188

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:

Probability(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Since Deck B has 18 X cards and 18 O cards, the probability calculations are the same as for Deck A.

Probability(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0188

Now, we can find the odds of the event happening in Deck A vs. Deck B:

Odds(3X, 1O | Deck A) / Odds(3X, 1O | Deck B) = Probability(3X, 1O | Deck A) / Probability(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Since both probabilities are approximately equal, the odds are also approximately equal:

{odds: 1}

Therefore, based on the data we have, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are approximately equal to the odds of them being drawn from Deck B. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the 4 cards were more likely to be drawn from Deck A or Deck B.
