To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

Let's calculate P(3X, 1O | Deck A) and P(3X, 1O | Deck B):

1. P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(10, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(10, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
   = 120 * (8/27) * (1/9) + 120 * (8/27)^2 * (2/3) + 10 * (8/27) * (1/9)^2 * (2/3)^2
   = 0.0505 + 0.0186 + 0.00012 ≈ 0.0692

2. P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
   = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9) + 220 * (1/27)^2 * (4/9) + 120 * (1/27) * (1/9)^2 * (4/9)^2
   = 0.0037 + 0.00037 + 0.0000016 ≈ 0.0041

Now, calculate P(Deck A) and P(Deck B):

1. P(Deck A) = 1
2. P(Deck B) = 1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
{odds: 0.0692 / 0.0041 ≈ 16.85}

The posterior odds are approximately 16.85 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
