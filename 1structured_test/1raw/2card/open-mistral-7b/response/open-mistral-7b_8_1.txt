To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                     = 35 * (1/27) + 20 * (1/27)
                                     = 55/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(7, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                     = 20 * (1/27) + 35 * (1/27)
                                     = 55/27

Since the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks are equal, the posterior odds will be 1:

{odds: 1}

This result suggests that, given the observed data, we cannot determine with certainty which deck the cards were drawn from. The prior probability of drawing from Deck A or Deck B remains unchanged, and the observed data does not provide enough information to favor one deck over the other.
