To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A over Deck B, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X on the first draw is 2/3, so the probability of drawing an O on the first draw is 1/3. After drawing an X or an O, there are now 57 cards left in the deck, with 37 X's and 20 O's. The probability of drawing an X on the second draw is now 37/57, and the probability of drawing an O is 20/57. Repeating this process for the third draw, we get the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3) * (1/3) * (37/57) * (20/56) * (57/55) = 20/1185

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X on the first draw is 1/3, so the probability of drawing an O on the first draw is 2/3. After drawing an X or an O, there are now 52 cards left in the deck, with 17 X's and 35 O's. The probability of drawing an X on the second draw is now 17/52, and the probability of drawing an O is 35/52. Repeating this process for the third draw, we get the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3) * (2/3) * (17/52) * (35/51) * (52/50) = 17/1185

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:

L = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 20/1185 / 17/1185 = 20/3960 / 17/3960 = 20/17 * 1/3960 / 17/3960 = 2/17

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is the likelihood ratio times the prior odds, where the prior odds are the probability of each deck being chosen:

P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So the posterior odds are:

{odds: 2 * 2/17 = 4/17}

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, are 4 to 17 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
