To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide those probabilities.

Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                        = 220 / 243

Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                        = 1820 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                        = 1820 / 27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (220 / 243) / (1820 / 27)
      = 220 * 27 / (243 * 1820)
      = 220 * 27 / 46336
      = 11 / 226

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 11 to 226.
