To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

The prior odds are the odds of drawing from Deck A before observing the cards. Since there are two possible decks and Deck A has more X cards, it's more likely to draw from Deck A. The probability of drawing from Deck A is 1/2, and the probability of drawing from Deck B is also 1/2.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(15, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                             = 455

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                             = 420

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = 455 / 420
    â‰ˆ 1.083

The prior odds are 1 (since the probabilities of drawing from the two decks are equal). The likelihood ratio is the update factor, which multiplies the prior odds to get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR
                          = 1 * 1.083
                          = 1.083

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data, is approximately 1.083. This means that, based on the observed data, it is slightly more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B. However, the difference is quite small, suggesting that the data does not provide strong evidence to favor one deck over the other.
