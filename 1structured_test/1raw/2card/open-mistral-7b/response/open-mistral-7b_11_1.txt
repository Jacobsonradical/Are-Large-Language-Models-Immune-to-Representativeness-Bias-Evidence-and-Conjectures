To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the data given Deck A and Deck B. We'll first find the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio.

Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (C(52, 4))
                 ≈ 0.0561

Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / (C(52, 4))
                 ≈ 0.1429

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
   ≈ 0.0561 / 0.1429
   ≈ 0.3957

Finally, to get the posterior odds, we use the prior odds (the odds before observing the data) which is 2 because Deck A has twice as many X-marked cards as Deck B. Multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds:

{odds: 0.3957 * 2 ≈ 0.7914}

So, the posterior odds are approximately 0.79 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
