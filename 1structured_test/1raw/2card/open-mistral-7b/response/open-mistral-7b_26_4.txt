To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B, given that 4 cards were drawn.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                              = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 12 * (1/9) * (2/3)
                              = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                              = 88 * (2/27)
                              = 352/27

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                              = 1530 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 18 * (2/9) * (1/3)
                              = 1530 * (2/27) * (2/9)
                              = 1530 * (4/27^2)
                              = 6120/27^2
                              = 6120/729

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = 352/27 / 6120/729
      = 352/27 * 729/6120
      = 121/108

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, are 121 to 108 compared to Deck B.
