To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

Given that Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 2/3 of the deck, multiplied by the combination of choosing 1 O out of 1/3 of the deck:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 1/3 of the deck, multiplied by the combination of choosing 1 O out of 2/3 of the deck:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now let's denote the prior probability of drawing Deck A as P(A) and the prior probability of drawing Deck B as P(B). Since each deck is equally likely to be drawn, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of drawing Deck A, given the observed data, is:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)

where P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated, we can find the posterior probability of drawing Deck A:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5) / (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5 + C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5)

Now we can calculate the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

After calculating these probabilities, we get the final odds:

{odds: 1.7583}

So, the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.76 times higher than the probability that they were drawn from Deck B.
