To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                 = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                 = 220/243

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                 = 252 * (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
                                 = 252 * (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
                                 = 252 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                 = 252/243

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (220/243) / (252/243)
      = 220 / 252

Since the ratio of 220 to 252 is less than 1, it indicates a lower probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with the most X-marked cards. The more precise answer is:

{odds: 0.8703}

However, since the question asks for the answer in the format of a single number, the decimal part can be ignored, and the answer would be:

{odds: 8703/10000} or approximately {odds: 0.87}
