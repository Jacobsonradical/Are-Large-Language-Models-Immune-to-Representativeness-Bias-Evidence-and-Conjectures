To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first find the probabilities for each deck:

Deck A:
P(X) = Number of X-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 2/3
P(O) = Number of O-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 1/3

P(3X, 1O) (Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                             = 220/243

Deck B:
P(X) = Number of X-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 1/3
P(O) = Number of O-marked cards / Total number of cards
      = 2/3

P(3X, 1O) (Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                             = 220 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                             = 440/243

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O) (Deck A) / P(3X, 1O) (Deck B)
                      = 220/243 / 440/243
                      = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1 to 2. This means that Deck B is slightly more likely to be the chosen deck based on the observed data. However, the odds are not very strong, and further evidence or information might change this conclusion.
