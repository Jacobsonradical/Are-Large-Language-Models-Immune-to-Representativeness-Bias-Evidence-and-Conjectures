To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^(12-3)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X|B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(18-3)

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

= P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

= (P(3X|A) * P(1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X|B) * P(1O|B) * P(B))

= (P(1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(1O|B) * P(B)) * (P(3X|A) / P(3X|B))

Since there are the same number of cards in both decks, the probability of drawing one card from a deck is 1 for both decks. Therefore, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

We know that P(X|A) = 2/3, P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|A) = 1/3, and P(O|B) = 2/3. Now we can calculate the odds:

Odds = (P(O|A) * P(A)) / (P(O|B) * P(B)) * (P(3X|A) / P(3X|B))

= (1/3 * 1/2) / (2/3 * 1/2) * (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^9) / (C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^15)

= (1/6) / (2/6) * (220) / (4060)

= 11 / 2060 â‰ˆ 0.0053

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.0053. This means that given the observed data, Deck A is about 53 times less likely than Deck B to have been the source of the drawn cards.
