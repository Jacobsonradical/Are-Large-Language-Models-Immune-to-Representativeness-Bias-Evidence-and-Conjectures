To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds (the probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B).

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^36

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^18 * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^35

Now, let's calculate the prior odds:
P(Deck A) = 2/3
P(Deck B) = 1/3

The posterior odds are then:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)} = {P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)}

After calculating the probabilities and simplifying the equation, we get:

{odds: 2424/3780} â‰ˆ {odds: 2.16}

So, given the drawing of 3 X's and 1 O, the posterior odds suggest that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A about 2.16 times more likely than from Deck B.
