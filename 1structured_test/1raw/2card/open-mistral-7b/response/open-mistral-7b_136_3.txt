To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then compare them.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a X from Deck A as P(X|A), which is 2/3. Similarly, we can denote the probability of drawing a X from Deck B as P(X|B), which is 1/3.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is (P(X|A))^3 * (P(O|A)), where P(O|A) is the probability of drawing an O from Deck A, which is 1/3.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is (P(X|B))^3 * (P(O|B)), where P(O|B) is the probability of drawing an O from Deck B, which is 2/3.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:

Likelihood of 3X and 1O from Deck A = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3))
Likelihood of 3X and 1O from Deck B = ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Since we are given that the deck was selected at random and the 4 cards were drawn at random, we can assume that the prior probability of drawing from Deck A and Deck B is equal. Let's denote this probability as P(A) = P(B).

The posterior odds can be calculated as the ratio of the likelihoods:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Likelihood of 3X and 1O from Deck B)

Plugging in the values:

Posterior odds = (((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)))

Simplifying the expression:

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (1/8)

Posterior odds = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 8 times higher than drawing from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
