To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Prior odds:
Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)³ * (1/3) = 1/27.
Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)³ * (2/3) = 1/81.

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A are therefore 1/81 / 1/27 = 2/7.

Likelihood:
Given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O, the probability of drawing this sequence from Deck A is (2/3)³ * (1/3) = 1/27, as calculated above.
The probability of drawing this sequence from Deck B is (1/3)³ * (2/3)² = 1/162, which is lower than the probability for Deck A.

Posterior odds:
To find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck:

Posterior odds (Deck A) = Prior odds * Likelihood(Deck A) = (2/7) * (1/27) = 1/126
Posterior odds (Deck B) = Prior odds * Likelihood(Deck B) = (2/7) * (1/162) = 1/1092

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1/126 / 1/1092 ≈ 0.957, or about 95.7% in favor of Deck A.

So, the answer is {odds: 0.957} or approximately 95.7%.
