To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]

P(3X,1O|A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(A) = 1

Since the number of cards in Deck B is twice that of Deck A, and the probability of drawing a card marked X is the same in both decks, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as:

P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)

P(3X,1O|B) = C(24,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)}

Calculating the above expression, the posterior odds are approximately 3:2 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
