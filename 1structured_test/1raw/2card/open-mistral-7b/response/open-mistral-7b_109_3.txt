To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O):

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(draw 3X and 1O from A) / P(draw any 4 cards from A)

Since there are C(13, 3) ways to choose 3 X's and C(13, 1) ways to choose 1 O from Deck A, and C(52, 4) ways to choose any 4 cards from a deck of 52, we have:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(13, 3) * C(13, 1) / C(52, 4)

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O):

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(draw 3X and 1O from B) / P(draw any 4 cards from B)

Since there are C(13, 3) ways to choose 3 X's and C(26, 1) ways to choose 1 O from Deck B, and C(52, 4) ways to choose any 4 cards from a deck of 52, we have:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(13, 3) * C(26, 1) / C(52, 4)

Now, to find the likelihood ratio, we divide P(B|3X, 1O) by P(A|3X, 1O):

Likelihood ratio = P(B|3X, 1O) / P(A|3X, 1O)

Calculating the values for each probability, we get:

Likelihood ratio ≈ (C(13, 3) * C(26, 1)) / (C(13, 3) * C(13, 1))

Simplifying the expression, we have:

Likelihood ratio ≈ (26 * 13) / (13 * 13)

Likelihood ratio ≈ 26/13

Now, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds (which is 1 since we don't have any information about which deck was drawn initially):

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio

Posterior odds ≈ 26/13

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 26/13. This means that, given the observed data, we have a higher probability of believing that the drawings came from Deck A than Deck B.
