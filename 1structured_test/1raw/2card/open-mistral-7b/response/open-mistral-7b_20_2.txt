To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's drawn as O_A. Similarly, let X_B and O_B represent the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial distribution:

P(X_A = 3, O_A = 1 | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B, the probability is:

P(X_B = 3, O_B = 1 | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(Deck A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)]

= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

= [(C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) * (2/3)] / [(C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) * (1/3)]

= 2 * (C(7, 3) / C(6, 3))

= 2 * 7/6

= 7/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with the most X-marked cards, is 7/3.
