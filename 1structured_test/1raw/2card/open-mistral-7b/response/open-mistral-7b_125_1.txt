To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X1O) / P(B | 3X1O) = (P(3X1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X1O | B) * P(B))

We don't have the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), but since we are given that Deck A has more X-marked cards, we can assume that P(A) > P(B). Given this information, the odds will be greater than 1 in favor of Deck A.

However, without the specific values of P(A) and P(B), we cannot provide a numerical value for the odds. The answer is therefore:

{odds: > 1 (with P(A) > P(B))}
