To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

P(A) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A
     = (Number of ways to choose 3X from 2/3 * total cards in Deck A) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from 1/3 * total cards in Deck A)
     = (C(2/3 * total cards, 3)) * (C(1/3 * total cards, 1))
     = (C(2/3 * N, 3)) * (C(1/3 * N, 1))

P(B) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B
     = (Number of ways to choose 3X from 1/3 * total cards in Deck B) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from 2/3 * total cards in Deck B)
     = (C(1/3 * total cards, 3)) * (C(2/3 * total cards, 1))
     = (C(1/3 * N, 3)) * (C(2/3 * N, 1))

Now, let's find the prior odds:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

After drawing 3X and 1O, the probability of each deck changes, and we need to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X and 1O)) / (P(B|3X and 1O))

The likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck is the same, so we can simplify the posterior odds calculation:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X and 1O) / P(B|3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O|A) / P(3X and 1O|B) * P(A) / P(B)

Since P(3X and 1O|A) and P(3X and 1O|B) are equal, we can simplify further:

Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B)

However, we don't have the exact values for P(A) and P(B) since we don't know the total number of cards in each deck (denoted as N). To provide an answer, we would need this information.

So, the answer is:
{odds: cannot be determined without knowing the total number of cards in each deck}
