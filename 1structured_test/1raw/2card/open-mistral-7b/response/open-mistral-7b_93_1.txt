To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3)^1
                      = 35 * (1/27) * (1/3) * (24/27)
                      = 35 * (1/81)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1 - (1/3)^3)^1
                      = 20 * (1/27) * (2/9) * (8/27)
                      = 20 * (2/243)

Now, we can calculate the ratio of these probabilities to find the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)}

{odds: (35 * (1/81)) / (20 * (2/243)) = 35 / (2 * 20) = 7 / 4}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 7 to 4.
