To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's calculate the probabilities first:

1. P(Draw XXXO from Deck A): (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/216
2. P(Draw XXOX from Deck A): (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 8/81
3. P(Draw XOXX from Deck A): (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/81
4. P(Draw XXXO from Deck A): (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/216
5. P(Draw XOXO from Deck A): (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/81
6. P(Draw XOOX from Deck A): (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Calculate the probabilities for Deck B:

1. P(Draw XXXO from Deck B): (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81
2. P(Draw XOXX from Deck B): (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/81
3. P(Draw XOOX from Deck B): (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/81
4. P(Draw XOXO from Deck B): (1/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/54
5. P(Draw XXOO from Deck B): (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 2/81
6. P(Draw OOOX from Deck B): (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [Likelihood of Draw X's from Deck A / Likelihood of Draw X's from Deck B] * [Prior odds]

Since there are 6 possible ways to draw 3 X and 1 O from both decks, we will assume the prior odds to be 1 (equal likelihood of either deck being selected).

Let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck:

1. P(Draw XXXO from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw XXXO from Deck A) + P(Draw XXXO from Deck B) = 8/216 + 2/81 = 18/1686
2. P(Draw XOXX from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw XOXX from Deck A) + P(Draw XOXX from Deck B) = 8/81 + 4/81 = 12/42
3. P(Draw XOOX from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw XOOX from Deck A) + P(Draw XOOX from Deck B) = 2/81 + 2/81 = 4/81
4. P(Draw XOXO from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw XOXO from Deck A) + P(Draw XOXO from Deck B) = 4/81 + 8/54 = 40/216
5. P(Draw XXOO from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw XXOO from Deck A) + P(Draw XXOO from Deck B) = 2/81 + 1/27 = 29/288
6. P(Draw OOOX from Deck A or Deck B) = P(Draw OOOX from Deck A) + P(Draw OOOX from Deck B) = 6/216 + 1/27 = 27/288

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds for each possible draw:

1. Posterior odds for XXXO = [P(Draw XXXO from Deck A) / P(Draw XXXO from Deck B)] * [1] = [8/216 / 2/81] = 1/9
2. Posterior odds for XOXX = [P(Draw XOXX from Deck A) / P(Draw XOXX from Deck B)] * [1] = [8/81 / 4/81] = 2
3. Posterior odds for XOOX = [P(Draw XOOX from Deck A) / P(Draw XOOX from Deck B)] * [1] = [2/81 / 2/81] = 1
4. Posterior odds for XOXO = [P(Draw XOXO from Deck A) / P(Draw XOXO from Deck B)] * [1] = [40/216 / 8/54] = 3/2
5. Posterior odds for XXOO = [P(Draw XXOO from Deck A) / P(Draw XXOO from Deck B)] * [1] = [2/81 / 1/27] = 2/3
6. Posterior odds for OOOX = [P(Draw OOOX from Deck A) / P(Draw OOOX from Deck B)] * [1] = [6/216 / 1/27] = 1/4

Since we don't have enough information to determine which specific draw occurred, we can't find a final answer. However, we can say that depending on the draw, the posterior odds can range from 1/9 to 2/3.
