To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Since the probabilities are equal, the posterior odds are 1:1

{odds: 1}

However, there might be a misunderstanding in the question as the information given is not sufficient to determine the prior odds. The prior odds would depend on the initial probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B, which is not provided in the question.
