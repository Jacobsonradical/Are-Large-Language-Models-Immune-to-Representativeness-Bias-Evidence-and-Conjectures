To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's find P(3X, 1O | A):

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(4, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3

Calculating the combinations C(n, k) and simplifying the expressions, we get:

P(3X, 1O | A) ≈ 0.1905

Next, let's find P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3

Calculating the combinations C(n, k) and simplifying the expressions, we get:

P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 0.0509

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 3.73

Finally, the posterior odds are given by:

{odds: LR} = {odds: 3.73}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 3.73 to 1.
