To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A as A and the event of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B as B.

The prior probability of selecting Deck A is P(A) = 1/2 and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is P(B) = 1/2.

The likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A is P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = 4/27

The likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B is P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = 4/27

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|3X, 1O) = Likelihood of A * Prior probability of A / (Likelihood of A * Prior probability of A + Likelihood of B * Prior probability of B)

P(A|3X, 1O) = (4/27) * (1/2) / ((4/27) * (1/2) + (4/27) * (1/2)) = 1/2

P(B|3X, 1O) = Likelihood of B * Prior probability of B / (Likelihood of A * Prior probability of A + Likelihood of B * Prior probability of B)

P(B|3X, 1O) = (4/27) * (1/2) / ((4/27) * (1/2) + (4/27) * (1/2)) = 1/2

Since the probabilities are equal, the odds are also equal:

{odds: 1}

The odds of drawing 4 cards with the given distribution from Deck A are the same as drawing them from Deck B. This means that, given the observed data, there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other.
