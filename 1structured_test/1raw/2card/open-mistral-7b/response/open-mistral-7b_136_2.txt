To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds (which is 1 in this case, as we have no initial information about which deck was drawn).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                           = 286

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                           = 120

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = 286 / 120
      â‰ˆ 2.383

So, given the observed data of 3 X's and 1 O, the posterior odds are approximately 2.383:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X.
