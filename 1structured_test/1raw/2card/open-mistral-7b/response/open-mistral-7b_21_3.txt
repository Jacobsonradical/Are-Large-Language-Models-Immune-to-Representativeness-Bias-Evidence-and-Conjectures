To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as P(A|4X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as P(B|4X,1O).

For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is calculated as follows:
P(A|4X,1O) = C(3,3)*(2/3)^3*(1/3)^1 + C(3,2)*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^2*(1/3)^1
            = 0.0027 + 0.0045 = 0.0072

For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is calculated as follows:
P(B|4X,1O) = C(3,1)*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^1 + C(3,2)*(1/3)^2*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^1 + C(3,3)*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^0
            = 0.0009 + 0.0018 + 0.0003 = 0.0029

Now, let's assume the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are calculated as follows:

odds = P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O) = (P(A) * P(4X,1O|A)) / (P(B) * P(4X,1O|B))
     = (0.5 * 0.0072) / (0.5 * 0.0029)
     = 0.2541 / 0.0148 â‰ˆ 17.1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 17.1 times higher than from Deck B.
