To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(3X1O|A), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(3X1O|B).

P(3X1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / [(2/3)! * (1/3)!] = 2/8 = 1/4

P(3X1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 2!) / [(1/3)! * (2/3)!] = 2/8 = 1/4

Now, let P(A) be the probability that the drawn cards are from Deck A, and P(B) be the probability that they are from Deck B.

Since we don't have any prior information about whether the cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B, we'll assume they are equally likely, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of Deck A given the drawn cards is P(A|3X1O) = [P(3X1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X1O|B) * P(B)].

Plugging in our values, we get P(A|3X1O) = [(1/4) * (1/2)] / [(1/4) * (1/2) + (1/4) * (1/2)] = 1/2.

Similarly, the posterior probability of Deck B given the drawn cards is P(B|3X1O) = [P(3X1O|B) * P(B)] / [P(3X1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X1O|B) * P(B)].

Plugging in our values, we get P(B|3X1O) = [(1/4) * (1/2)] / [(1/4) * (1/2) + (1/4) * (1/2)] = 1/2.

Since the posterior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B are equal, the posterior odds are 1:1.

So, {odds: 1} indicates that there is no preference for either Deck A or Deck B based on the given information.
