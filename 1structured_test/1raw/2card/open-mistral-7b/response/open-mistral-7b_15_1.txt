To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Let P(3X1O|A) be the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards given Deck A, and P(3X1O|B) be the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards given Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A is calculated as follows:
P(3X1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
         = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
         = 220 / 273

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B is calculated as follows:
P(3X1O|B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
         = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9)
         = 220 / 81

Now, let's calculate the priors:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks have equal chances of being selected)
P(B) = 1/2

We can now calculate the likelihood ratio:
L = P(3X1O|A) / P(3X1O|B)
   = 220 / 273 * 81 / 220
   = 81 / 273

The posterior probabilities can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X1O) = P(A) * L
          = (1/2) * (81/273)
          = 81 / 546

P(B|3X1O) = P(B) * (1 - L)
          = (1/2) * (273 - 81) / 273
          = 129 / 546

The posterior odds can now be calculated:
odds = P(A|3X1O) / P(B|3X1O)
     = (81/546) / (129/546)
     = 81 / 129
    â‰ˆ 0.6263

So, the posterior odds are approximately 0.63 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
