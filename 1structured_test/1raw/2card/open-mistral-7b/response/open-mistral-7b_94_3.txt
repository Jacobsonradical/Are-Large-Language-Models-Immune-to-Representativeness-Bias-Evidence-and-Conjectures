To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9
             = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (12) * (1/9)
             = 220 * 1/273

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^27
             = (840) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (36) * (1/81)
             = 840 * 1/273

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
     = (220 * 1/273) / (840 * 1/273)
     = 220 / 840
     = 11 / 42 â‰ˆ 0.262

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.262. This means that, given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O, Deck A is about 26.2% as likely as Deck B.
