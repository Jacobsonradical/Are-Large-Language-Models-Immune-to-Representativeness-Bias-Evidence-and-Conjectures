To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck:

Deck A:
P(X) = Number of X cards / Total number of cards
     = 2/3

P(O) = Number of O cards / Total number of cards
     = 1/3

P(3X and 1O) = P(X)^3 * P(O)
             = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
             = 8/273

Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3

P(3X and 1O) = P(X)^3 * P(O)
             = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
             = 1/81

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X and 1O)
     = (P(3X and 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X and 1O | Deck B)) * (P(Deck A)) / (P(Deck B))
     = (8/273) / (1/81) * (1/3) / (2/3)
     = (8/273) * (3/2) / (1/2)
     = (64/273)

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 64/273.
