To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

1. Deck A:
   The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (4 drawn) with 8 X's and 4 O's is given by the binomial distribution:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(8, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
   Simplifying this, we get:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = 56 * (1/27)

2. Deck B:
   The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (4 drawn) with 4 X's and 8 O's is given by the binomial distribution:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
   Simplifying this, we get:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 4 * (1/27)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

Since P(Deck A) = 2/3 and P(Deck B) = 1/3 (given that one deck is drawn at random), we have:

odds = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B))

odds = (56 * (1/3)) / (4 * (1/3))

odds = 14 : 1

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 14 to 1 compared to Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
