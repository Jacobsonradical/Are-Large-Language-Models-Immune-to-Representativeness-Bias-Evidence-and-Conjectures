To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|data).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:

P(A|data) = P(draw 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
                  = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^36
                  = 220 * (1/27) * (36) * (1/81)
                  = 220 * (36) / (27 * 81)
                  = 220 * 36 / 2187
                  ≈ 0.0491

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

P(B|data) = P(draw 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)
                  = C(36,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(12,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^12
                  = 840 * (1/27) * (1/2) * (12) * (1/27)
                  = 840 * (1/27) * (1/2) * (12) / (27)
                  = 840 * (1/2) / (27^2)
                  ≈ 0.0263

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|data) / P(B|data) ≈ 0.0491 / 0.0263 ≈ 1.86}

The posterior odds are approximately 1.86, which means there is slightly more evidence that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data. However, note that this result is based on certain assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probabilities might be different in real-world scenarios.
