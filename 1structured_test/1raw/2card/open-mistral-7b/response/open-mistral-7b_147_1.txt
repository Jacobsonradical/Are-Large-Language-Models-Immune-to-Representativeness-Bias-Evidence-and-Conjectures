To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(36, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^4]
                                 = 220 / 1820
                                 = 11/85

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(36, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^4]
                                 = 840 / 1820
                                 = 42/91

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
                         = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                         = 11/85 / 42/91
                         = 11/42 * 91/42
                         = 11/17

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 11/17.
