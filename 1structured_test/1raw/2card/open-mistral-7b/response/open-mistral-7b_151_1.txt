To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/243

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/243) / (2/81) = 8/162

Finally, to get the posterior odds, we multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds (since Deck A has more X's, it's more likely to be chosen):
Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, the prior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A.

So, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 8/162 * 2 = 16/324}

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 16 to 324 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
