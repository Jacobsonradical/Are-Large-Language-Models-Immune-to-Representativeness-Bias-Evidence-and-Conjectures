To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

1. Calculate the prior odds:
   Since we don't know which deck was chosen, the probability of each deck is equal (0.5 for each deck). The prior odds are then the ratio of these probabilities:
   Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1

2. Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B:
   Let L(A) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and L(B) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

   Deck A has 2/3 X's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's is (2/3)^3. The probability of drawing 1 O is 1/3. So the likelihood for Deck A is L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3).

   Deck B has 1/3 X's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's is (1/3)^3. The probability of drawing 1 O is 2/3. So the likelihood for Deck B is L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

3. Calculate the posterior odds:
   The posterior odds are the prior odds times the likelihood ratio:
   Posterior odds = Prior odds * (L(A) / L(B)) = 1 * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) = (2/3)^3.

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.167 or 1/6. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is about 6 times less likely than Deck B to have been the deck from which the 4 cards were drawn.
