To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- p(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A
- p(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B
- p(X|A) as the probability of drawing an X card from Deck A
- p(X|B) as the probability of drawing an X card from Deck B
- p(O|A) as the probability of drawing an O card from Deck A
- p(O|B) as the probability of drawing an O card from Deck B

Given that 4 cards were drawn, with 3 X's and 1 O, the likelihood of drawing from Deck A is:

p(A|3X, 1O) = p(3X, 1O|A) * p(A) / [p(3X, 1O|A) * p(A) + p(3X, 1O|B) * p(B)]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

p(3X, 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 * (1/27) = 8 * (1/9)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

p(3X, 1O|B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 153 * (1/27) = 5 * (1/9)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: p(A|3X, 1O) / p(B|3X, 1O)} = [(8/9) * p(A)] / [(5/9) * p(B)]

Since we don't have any prior information about the probabilities of drawing from either deck (p(A) and p(B)), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the odds favor drawing from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) over Deck B (where most cards are marked O) based on the observed data.
