To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck A as A_X and A_O, respectively, and the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B as B_X and B_O, respectively.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(A_X=3, A_O=1 | Deck A) = C(10,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:

P(B_X=3, B_O=1 | Deck B) = C(13,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = {odds: [P(A_X=3, A_O=1 | Deck A) / P(B_X=3, B_O=1 | Deck B)]}

Calculate the probabilities and substitute them into the formula to get the final answer.
