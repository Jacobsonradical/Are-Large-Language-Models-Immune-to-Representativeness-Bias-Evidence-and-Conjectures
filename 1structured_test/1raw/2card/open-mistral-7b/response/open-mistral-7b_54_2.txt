To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide that ratio by the prior odds (since the decks are equally likely to be chosen).

Let's first find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X1O|DeckA) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(13,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                 = (220) * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^1 + (782) * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^1
                 = 0.03488 + 0.03488 ≈ 0.06976

For Deck B:
P(3X1O|DeckB) = C(12,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(13,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                 = (220) * (0.1)^3 * (0.7)^1 + (782) * (0.1)^3 * (0.7)^1
                 = 0.00888 + 0.00888 ≈ 0.01776

Now, let's calculate the prior odds:

P(DeckA) = P(DeckB) = 1/2

The posterior odds are:

odds = P(DeckA|3X1O) / P(DeckB|3X1O)
          = P(3X1O|DeckA) * P(DeckA) / P(3X1O|DeckB) * P(DeckB)
          = (0.06976) * (1/2) / (0.01776) * (1/2)
          ≈ 2.27

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 2.27 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B as the source of the 4 cards.
