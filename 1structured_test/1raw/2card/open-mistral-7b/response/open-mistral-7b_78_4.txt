To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

Probability (3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 18, 3) * C(1/3 * 18, 1) / C(18, 4)
                                              ≈ 0.117

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Probability (3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 27, 3) * C(2/3 * 27, 1) / C(27, 4)
                                              ≈ 0.056

The odds of the event occurring in Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 0.117 / 0.056 ≈ 2.1}

So, the posterior odds are approximately 2.1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
