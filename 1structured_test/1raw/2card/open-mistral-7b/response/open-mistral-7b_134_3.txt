To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is a combination of drawing 3 X's out of 2/3 of the cards and 1 O out of 1/3 of the cards, which can be calculated as (2/3 choose 3) * (1/3) = 1/2.

P(A) is the probability of selecting deck A, which is equal to 1 since we assume that both decks are equally likely to be selected.

P(3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O regardless of the deck, which is the sum of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is a combination of drawing 3 X's out of 1/3 of the cards and 1 O out of 2/3 of the cards, which can be calculated as (1/3 choose 3) * (2/3) = 1/12.

P(B) is the probability of selecting deck B, which is also equal to 1 since we assume that both decks are equally likely to be selected.

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)} = (1/2) / (1/12) = 1/2

However, since we are interested in the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to take the inverse of the above odds:

{odds: 1 / (1/2)} = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2:1. This means that, given the observed data, it is twice as likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as from Deck B.
