To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability that the deck is A and P(B) be the probability that the deck is B.

We know that P(A) + P(B) = 1

Let P(3X, 1O | A) be the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A, and P(3X, 1O | B) be the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.

We can calculate these probabilities using combinations:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (1/3)^4]
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (1/3)^4]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

Plug in the probabilities we calculated:

odds = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Since the decks are equally likely to be selected (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), the odds simplify to:

odds = (P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B))

Calculate the probabilities and plug them in:

odds = (P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B)) = (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplify the expression, and you get your odds.
