To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Then, we can take the ratio of these probabilities to get the odds.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/273

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/9) = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the odds:

Posterior odds = Probability of Deck A / Probability of Deck B
                = (8/273) / (2/81)
                = 4/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4/27.
