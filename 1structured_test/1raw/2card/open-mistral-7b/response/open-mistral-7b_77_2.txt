To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them. Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as N_A for Deck A and N_B for Deck B.

1. Likelihood of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A:
   P(3X's and 1O | Deck A) = C(N_A, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * [1 - (2/3)^3 * (1/3)]^(N_A - 3)

2. Likelihood of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B:
   P(3X's and 1O | Deck B) = C(N_B, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * [1 - (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]^(N_B - 3)

We know that in both decks, the number of X's is 3 times the number of O's. Let's assume that the total number of cards in both decks is the same, denoted as N = N_A = N_B. Then we can write N_A = 3N/4 and N_B = 4N/3.

We're interested in the ratio of the likelihoods, which is the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X's and 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X's and 1O)} = [P(3X's and 1O | Deck A)] / [P(3X's and 1O | Deck B)]

The exact calculation of this ratio requires knowing the total number of cards N. But we can see that if N is very large, then the likelihoods will be dominated by the combinations C(N, 3) and the probabilities (2/3)^3 and (1/3), which are constant for both decks. In this case, the ratio of the probabilities will be close to the inverse of the ratio of X-marked cards in each deck, which is 4/3.

Therefore, if we assume N is large, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 4/3.
