To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as Xa and the number of O's drawn as Oa. Similarly, let Xb and Ob be the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:
P(Xa=3, Oa=1 | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:
P(Xb=3, Ob=1 | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

{odds: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)}

Calculating this expression gives us approximately 1.5 odds in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.

Final answer: {odds: 1.5}
