To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We'll first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 1/81

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = 1/2
P(B) = 1/2

Using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability of A = P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

Calculating the numerator and denominator:
Numerator = (4/81) * (1/2) = 2/162
Denominator = (2/162) + (1/81) * (1/2)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = (2/162) / ((1/81) * (1/2))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

odds = 2/81 / (1/162) = 2/1

So, the posterior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that, given the observation of 3X and 1O cards, it is twice as likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, which has more X-marked cards, than from Deck B, which has more O-marked cards.
