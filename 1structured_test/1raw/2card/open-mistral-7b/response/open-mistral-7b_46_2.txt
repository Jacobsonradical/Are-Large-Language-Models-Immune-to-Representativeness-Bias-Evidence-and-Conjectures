To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                   = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                   = 220 * (1/81)
                                   = 26/81

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(27, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                   = 27 * (1/27)^3 * (2/9)
                                   = 27 * (1/27)^3 * (2/9)
                                   = 27 * (1/27)^3 * (2/9)
                                   = 2 * (1/81)
                                   = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's, 1 O)
      = P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B)
      = (26/81) / (2/81)
      = 26/2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 26 to 2.
