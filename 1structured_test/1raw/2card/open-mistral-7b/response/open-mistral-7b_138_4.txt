To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then calculate the odds ratio.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (1! * 3!) = 1/24 * 3 = 1/8

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 1!) / (3! * 1!) * (2! * 2!) = 1 * 1 * (2! * 2!) / (3! * 3!) = 1/6 * 4 = 2/3

Now, let's calculate the odds ratio:

Odds ratio = (probability of Deck A) / (probability of Deck B) = (1/8) / (2/3)

To simplify this, we can find the common denominator, which is 24:

Odds ratio = (1/8) * (3/2) = 3/24 = 1/8

Since the odds ratio is less than 1, it means that the event is less likely to occur in Deck A than in Deck B. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is:

{odds: 1/8}
