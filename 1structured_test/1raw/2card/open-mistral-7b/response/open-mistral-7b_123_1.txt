To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * [P(Deck A) / P(total cards)]
                                 = 220 * (1/27) * (1/4) * (1/2)
                                 = 220 / 3888

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * [P(Deck B) / P(total cards)]
                                 = 84 * (1/27) * (2/9) * (1/2)
                                 = 84 / 1587

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = [P(Deck A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)]
                          = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                          = [(220/3888) * (1/2)] / [(84/1587) * (1/2)]
                          = [220 / 3888] / [84 / 1587]
                          = 220 / 3888 * (1587 / 84)
                          = 357400 / 329168
                          = 1.08

So, the posterior odds are approximately 1.08, suggesting that the 4 cards are slightly more likely to have been drawn from Deck A than Deck B. However, since the difference is not significant, we cannot conclusively say that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
