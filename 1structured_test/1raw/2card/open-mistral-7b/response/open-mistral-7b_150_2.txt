To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let's assume there are N cards in each deck.

Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are X, so we have 2N/3 X's and 1N/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial coefficient:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2N/3, 3) * C(1N/3, 1)

Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are X, so we have 1N/3 X's and 2N/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial coefficient:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(1N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
          = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)

We don't have enough information to calculate the prior probabilities P(Deck A) and P(Deck B), so we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the odds as a function of the prior probabilities:

odds = (C(2N/3, 3) * C(1N/3, 1)) / (C(1N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1)) * [P(Deck A)] / [P(Deck B)]

The formula above shows that the posterior odds depend on the number of cards in the decks (N) and the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B. To get a numerical answer, you would need to specify the prior probabilities or make an assumption about their values.
