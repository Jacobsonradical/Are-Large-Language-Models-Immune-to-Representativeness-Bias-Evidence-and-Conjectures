To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide the likelihood of Deck A by the likelihood of Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X and 1/3 O is given by the binomial probability:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
   where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, n is the total number of trials (draws), and k is the number of successes (X's).

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X and 2/3 O is given by the binomial probability:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

3. The prior odds (before drawing the cards) are 2:1 in favor of Deck A, since Deck A has more X's.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of Deck A) / (Likelihood of Deck B) * Prior odds
               = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B)) * 2

First, let's calculate the likelihoods:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0024
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.0003

Now, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (0.0024) / (0.0003) * 2 ≈ 128

So, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, the posterior odds are approximately 128 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observed data, it is much more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
