To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A compared to Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Likelihood ratio = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (1/27)

Likelihood ratio = 8

Finally, since the prior odds of drawing from Deck A or Deck B are 1, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio with the prior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

Posterior odds = 8 * 1

Posterior odds = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8 to 1.

In other words, the probability of drawing 4 cards marked X and O from Deck A is 8 times more likely than drawing from Deck B.
