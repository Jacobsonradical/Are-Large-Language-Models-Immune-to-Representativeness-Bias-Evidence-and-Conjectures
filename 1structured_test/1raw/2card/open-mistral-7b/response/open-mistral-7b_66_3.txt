To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

Probability(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                                                         = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                                         = 220/243

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

Probability(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                                                         = 1530 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                                         = 1020/243

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = Probability(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / Probability(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
                        = (220/243) / (1020/243)
                        = 220 / 1020
                        = 11 / 51

So the answer is {odds: 11/51} or approximately 0.2157, meaning there is a slightly higher probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
