To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then divide them.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(20, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                              = [(10! / (3! * 7!)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] + [(20! / (3! * 17!)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1]
                              = [120 * (2/27)] + [1140 * (2/27)]
                              = 4 * (2/27) + 1140 * (2/27)
                              = 4/27 + 1140/27
                              = 1144/27

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                              = [(10! / (3! * 7!)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] + [(20! / (3! * 17!)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
                              = [120 * (1/27)] + [1140 * (1/27)]
                              = 4 * (1/27) + 1140 * (1/27)
                              = 4/27 + 1140/27
                              = 1144/27

Since the probabilities are equal, the posterior odds are 1:1:

{odds: 1 : 1}

However, this result indicates there's no difference between the two decks given the observed data. To determine if Deck A is more likely than Deck B, we need additional information or assumptions. For example, if we know that Deck A is more likely to be selected than Deck B, we can adjust our probabilities accordingly.
