To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

Let P(A) and P(B) be the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

For Deck A (with probability P(A)):
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(24, 4) = 840 / 11440 = 7 / 90

For Deck B (with probability P(B)):
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(32, 4) = 4060 / 106268 = 4060 / 106260 ≈ 0.0378

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B).

LR ≈ 7 / 90 / (0.0378 ≈ 0.00355) = 1955.3

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from each deck:

P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds = 1955.3 * 2 ≈ 3910.6

Answer: {odds: 3910.6}
