To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                         = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (12) * (1/9) * (2/3)
                         = 220 * (1/27 * 1/9) * 2
                         = 320 * (1/162)
                         = 20/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                         = (1530) * (1/27) * (2/3) * (18) * (2/9) * (1/3)
                         = 1530 * (2/27) * (2/9)
                         = 160 * (2/243)
                         = 10/145

Now, let's find the posterior odds:
odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
        = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
        = 20/81 / 10/145
        = 20/81 * 145/10
        = 1400/810
        = 16/9

So, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A is 16/9.
