To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Deck A has 2/3 X and 1/3 O, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) for Deck A, where 12 is the total number of cards in Deck A (assuming each deck has the same number of cards).

Similarly, Deck B has 1/3 X and 2/3 O, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) for Deck B.

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / (C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3))}

To simplify this expression, note that C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = 220.

So the posterior odds are 220 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / 220 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = (2/3)^2 / (2/3) = 2/1 = 2:1

The 4 cards are 2 times more likely to have been drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
