To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, which is P(A) / P(B).

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, which is [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)].

Now, we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

{odds: [P(A) * [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)]] / [P(B) * [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]]}

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), so we can't give a specific number for the posterior odds. The calculation above provides the formula to find the actual odds given the prior probabilities.
