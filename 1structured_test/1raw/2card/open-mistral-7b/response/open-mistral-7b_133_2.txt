To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing 1 O out of 4 cards is 1/4.
Given that we have drawn 1 O, the probability of drawing 3 X's out of the remaining 3 cards is (2/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/6.
So, P(3X, 1O | A) = (1/4) * (1/6) = 1/24.

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing 1 O out of 4 cards is 1/4.
Given that we have drawn 1 O, the probability of drawing 3 X's out of the remaining 3 cards is (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/18.
So, P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/4) * (1/18) = 1/72.

Now, let's denote the prior probability of drawing Deck A as P(A), and the prior probability of drawing Deck B as P(B), where P(A) + P(B) = 1.

We want to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A, which is the ratio of the probabilities P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O):

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}

Given that we have no prior information about the likelihood of drawing Deck A or Deck B, we can assume that they are equally likely:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: (1/24) / (1/72)} = {odds: 1/3}

So, the posterior probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are X's and 1 is O, is 1/3 times the prior probability of drawing Deck A.
