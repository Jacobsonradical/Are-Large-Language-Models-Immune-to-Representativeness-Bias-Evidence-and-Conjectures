To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^36

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(40, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^39

Next, we calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
         = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
         = (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^36) / (C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(40, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^39)

After calculating the probabilities and simplifying the expression, we get:

odds â‰ˆ 0.806

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.806 to 1.
