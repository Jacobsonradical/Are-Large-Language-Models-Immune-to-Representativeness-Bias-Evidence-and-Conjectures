To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1 = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 1/27.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A / Likelihood of Deck B
              = (8/27) / (1/27)
              = 8 / 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8:1. This means that, given the evidence, Deck A is 8 times more likely than Deck B as the source of the 4 cards.
