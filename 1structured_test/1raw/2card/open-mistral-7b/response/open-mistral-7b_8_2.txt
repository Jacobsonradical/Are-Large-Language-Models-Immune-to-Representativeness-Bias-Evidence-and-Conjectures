To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios for both decks and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(52, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^0 + C(52, 4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(26, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(52, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^0 + C(52, 4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratios:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Calculate the probabilities and likelihood ratio, then convert the ratio to odds:

{odds: LR}
