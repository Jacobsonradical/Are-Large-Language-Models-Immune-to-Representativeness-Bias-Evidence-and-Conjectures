To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent Deck A and B represent Deck B. The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(A, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                 = 84 * (1/27)
                 = 3 * (1/3)
                 = 1/3

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(B, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                 = 84 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                 = 84 * (2/27)
                 = 8/9

Now, we know that the probability of drawing 4 cards from either deck is the same:

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)
          = (1/3) * (1) + (8/9) * (1)
          = 7/9

The prior odds are given by the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(A) / P(B) * P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)
                  = 2 * (1/3) / (8/9)
                  = 2 * (9/8)
                  = 3/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 3/2.
