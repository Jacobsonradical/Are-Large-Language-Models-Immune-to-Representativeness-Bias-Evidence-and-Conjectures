To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, and then the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O given each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing from Deck B as P(B) = 1 - P(A).

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O given Deck A is P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27), where (2/3)C3 denotes choosing 3 cards with X from Deck A, and (1/3)C1 denotes choosing 1 card with O from Deck A.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O given Deck B is P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (8/27).

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities:

P(A) = Number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A with 3X and 1O / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A
    = (C(12,3) * C(12,1)) / C(24,4)
    = 1680 / 4845

P(B) = Number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B with 3X and 1O / Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B
    = (C(12,3) * C(12,1)) / C(24,4)
    = 1680 / 1296
    = 4/3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
                = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)
                = (8/27) * (1680/4845) / (8/27) * (4/3)
                = (1680/4845) / (4/3)
                = 4845/144

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is {odds: 4845/144}.
