To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B:

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (C(26, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^4)
                        = 35 / 362880

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(13, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / (C(52, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^4)
                        = 286 / 65280

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratios:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 35 / 286
     â‰ˆ 0.1227

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds
                = (0.1227) * (P(Deck A)) / (P(Deck B))

Since we do not have any prior information about the probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B, the prior odds will be 1. Therefore, the posterior odds are approximately 0.1227.
