To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as B.

The prior probability of drawing from Deck A is P(A) = 1/2, and the prior probability of drawing from Deck B is P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3X and 1O from a deck of 2/3X and 1/3O:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) / C(1, 4)

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) / C(1, 4)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of drawing from Deck A given that 3X and 1O were drawn:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

The posterior odds are then the ratio of these probabilities:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Calculate these probabilities and take the ratio to find the odds.
