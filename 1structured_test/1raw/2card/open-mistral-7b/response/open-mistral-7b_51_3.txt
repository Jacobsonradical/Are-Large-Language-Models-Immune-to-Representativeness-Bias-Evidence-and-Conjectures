To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
A: Deck A
B: Deck B
X: marking X
O: marking O

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                      = 4 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                      = 4/81

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                      = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                      = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(A) = (number of Deck A) / (total number of decks)
      = 1

P(B) = 1 - P(A)
      = 1 - 1
      = 0

Since we have no prior information about which deck was selected, we can assume that both decks have an equal chance of being selected (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
                                      = (4/81) * (1/2) / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
                                      = 1/4

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/4. This means that, given the observed data (drawing 3X and 1O cards), Deck B is four times more likely than Deck A. However, since the posterior odds are less than 1, we should say that Deck A is less likely than Deck B to be the deck from which the cards were drawn.

{odds: 1/4}
