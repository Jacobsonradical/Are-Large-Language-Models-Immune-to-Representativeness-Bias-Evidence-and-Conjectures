To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

Let's denote A as the event that the deck is Deck A and B as the event that the deck is Deck B.

The prior odds are:
P(A) / P(B) = Number of decks labeled A / Number of decks labeled B
                 = 1 / 1 (since we only have two decks)
                 = 1

Now let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3 - 3 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + 3 * (2/3) * (1/3)^2)
                            ≈ 0.1428

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1 - (1/3)^3 - 3 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + 3 * (1/3) * (2/3)^2)
                            ≈ 0.0741

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B) ≈ 1.95

The posterior odds are given by:
P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O) = LR * P(A) / P(B)
                                                   ≈ 1.95 * 1
                                                   ≈ 1.95

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given that they have 3 X's and 1 O is approximately 1.95. This means that Deck A is about 1.95 times more likely than Deck B given this observation.
