To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

We can calculate P(A|3X,1O) as follows:

1. Probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A: P(X|A) = 2/3
2. Probability of drawing a card marked O from Deck A: P(O|A) = 1/3
3. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A: P(3X,1O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)

We can calculate P(B|3X,1O) similarly:

1. Probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck B: P(X|B) = 1/3
2. Probability of drawing a card marked O from Deck B: P(O|B) = 2/3
3. Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B: P(3X,1O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the probabilities:

{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)}

You can calculate the exact values of these probabilities to get the final odds.
