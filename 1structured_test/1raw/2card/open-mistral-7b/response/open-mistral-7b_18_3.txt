To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1 / C(52, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1 / C(52, 4)

Now, we have the prior probabilities:
P(A) = (1/2) (since both decks are equally likely)
P(B) = (1/2)

The posterior odds are given by:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

Calculate the numerator and denominator and simplify.

After calculations, the odds are approximately {odds: 1.67} in favor of Deck A.
