To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, and 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck)

Simplifying this, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1)) / C(1, 4)

Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B | 3X, 1O) = (C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1)) / C(1, 4)

Now, we can calculate the prior odds, which is the probability of drawing from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing from Deck B:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Assuming that both decks are equally likely to be drawn, we can assume that P(A) = P(B).

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of observing the data (3X, 1O) given Deck A to the probability of observing the data given Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Substituting the probabilities calculated above, we get:

Likelihood ratio = (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1)) / (C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1))

We can simplify this ratio to:

Likelihood ratio = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the prior odds remain the same as the posterior odds. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 1}

This means that, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O), the probability of drawing from Deck A is not any more or less likely than drawing from Deck B. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say that the drawn cards came from either deck with certainty.
