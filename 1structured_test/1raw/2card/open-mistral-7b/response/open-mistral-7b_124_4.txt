To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's start by calculating the probabilities for Deck A:
1. The probability of drawing a single X card from Deck A is 2/3.
2. The probability of drawing a single O card from Deck A is 1/3.
3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck A is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = (8/273).

Now let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
1. The probability of drawing a single X card from Deck B is 1/3.
2. The probability of drawing a single O card from Deck B is 2/3.
3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck B is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = (2/223).

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (8/273) / (2/223)} = {odds: 8/446 / 2/223} = {odds: 4/223} â‰ˆ {odds: 0.0178}

So the posterior odds are approximately 0.0178 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
