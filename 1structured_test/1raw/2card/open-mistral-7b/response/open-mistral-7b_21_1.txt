To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(36-1)
                             = (220) * (1/27) * (36) * (1/81) * (642)
                             = (220 * 36 * 642) / (27 * 81^2)
                             ≈ 0.0299

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(36-1)
                             = (182) * (1/27) * (18) * (1/81) * (642)
                             = (182 * 18 * 642) / (27 * 81^2)
                             ≈ 0.0164

Now, to find the posterior odds, we calculate the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: 0.0299 / 0.0164 ≈ 1.82}

So, given the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the deck, the posterior odds are approximately 1.82 times higher that the selected deck is Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, compared to Deck B.
