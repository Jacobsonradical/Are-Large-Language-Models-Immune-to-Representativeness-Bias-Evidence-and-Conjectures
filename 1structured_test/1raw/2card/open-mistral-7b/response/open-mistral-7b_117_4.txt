To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probabilities first:

1. Deck A:
   Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(13, 3) / C(26, 4)
   Where C(n, k) represents the combination of n items taken k at a time.

2. Deck B:
   Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(13, 3) / C(26, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A] / [Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B]

Do note that the calculations for C(13, 3) and C(26, 4) are quite complex and would require a calculator or software to compute accurately. However, once you have these values, you can calculate the posterior odds and get your final answer.

Please note that this is a theoretical calculation and the exact values may vary based on the specific combinations calculated.
