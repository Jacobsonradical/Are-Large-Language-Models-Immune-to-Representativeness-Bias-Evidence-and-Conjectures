To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                     = 35 / 27

The likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                     = 120 / 27

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities:

P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be drawn)
P(B) = 1/2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

odds = [P(A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(B | 3X, 1O)]
          = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
          = [(35/27) * (1/2)] / [(120/27) * (1/2)]
          = 35 / 120

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

{odds: 0.2917}

So, given that 3X and 1O cards were drawn, the odds are approximately 0.2917 that they were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X.
