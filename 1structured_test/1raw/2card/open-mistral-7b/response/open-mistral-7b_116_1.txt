To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide that by the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/243

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B:

Likelihood of drawing from Deck A = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A / Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
                                                 = (8/243) / (8/243) = 1

Since the likelihood is 1, this means that the prior odds do not change the posterior odds. The odds remain the same as the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being chosen.

The prior odds of Deck A being chosen are 2/1 (since there are more X's in Deck A), so the posterior odds are also 2/1.
