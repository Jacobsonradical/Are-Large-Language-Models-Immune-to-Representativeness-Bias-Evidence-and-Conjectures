To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                              = (35/6) * (1/27) + (20/6) * (4/9)
                              = 7/81 + 80/216
                              = 157/816

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(5, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
                              = (20/6) * (1/27) + (10/6) * (4/9)
                              = 20/81 + 40/81
                              = 60/81

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                          = 157/816 / 60/81
                          = 157/2430 / 60/81
                          = 7/126

Now we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds, which is theprobability of choosing deck A before drawing any cards:

P(Deck A) = 2/3

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds
                      = (7/126) * (2/3)
                      = 7/252

So the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is 7/252.
