To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and multiply it by the prior odds. The prior odds are the probability of Deck A being selected over Deck B, which is equal to the probability of Deck A being chosen divided by the probability of Deck B being chosen.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3)^1
                              = 0.2205

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^3)^1
                              = 0.1847

The prior odds are:
P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of Deck A * Prior odds / Likelihood of Deck B
                       = (0.2205) * (2) / (0.1847)
                       â‰ˆ 1.24

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 1.24 times higher than drawing them from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
