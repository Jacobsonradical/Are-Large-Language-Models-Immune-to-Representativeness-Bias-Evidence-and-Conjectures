To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

Let L(A|observation) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and L(B|observation) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The likelihood ratio is then given by:

L(A|observation) / L(B|observation)

First, let's calculate the likelihoods:

L(A|observation) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
                           = (2! / 3! * 1!) * (1! / 3!)
                           = 2 * 1 / 6 * 1
                           = 2 / 18

L(B|observation) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                           = (1! / 3! * 2!) * (2! / 3!)
                           = 1 * 2 / 6 * 2
                           = 2 / 18

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = L(A|observation) / L(B|observation)
    = (2/18) / (2/18)
    = 1

However, since the prior odds are given as the ratio of the probability of Deck A to Deck B, we need to multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds.

Let P(A) be the probability of choosing Deck A and P(B) be the probability of choosing Deck B. We are given that P(A) = 3P(B), so the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 3

Multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds
                       = (1) * (3)
                       = 3

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 3 times the odds of drawing from Deck B.
