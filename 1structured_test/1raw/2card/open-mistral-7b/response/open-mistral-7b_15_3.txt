To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A, and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = 2/225
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = 2/81

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

Since we don't have any information about which deck was drawn, we assume both decks have equal likelihood, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

P(3X, 1O) = (2/225) * 0.5 + (2/81) * 0.5 = 7/162

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Calculating these probabilities, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) ≈ 23/24
P(B | 3X, 1O) ≈ 1/24

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are {odds: 23/1} or approximately 23 to 1.
