To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. Let's first find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then calculate the likelihood ratio.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^4)
                         = 20 * (1/27) * (1/3) * (21/125)
                         = 20 * (1/2730)
                         = 700 / 136525

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^4)
                         = 20 * (1/27) * (2/27) * (17/81)
                         = 20 * (4/729)
                         = 80 / 10989

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                         = (700/136525) / (80/10989)
                         = 700 * (10989/80) / (136525 * 80)
                         = 52646400 / 10793312000
                         = 1/20

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 1/20}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is 1 to 20 compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
