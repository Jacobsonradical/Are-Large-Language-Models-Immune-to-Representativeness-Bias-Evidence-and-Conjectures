To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote the number of cards in either deck as N. Since the probabilities of X and O in Deck A are 2/3 and 1/3 respectively, and the sum of probabilities of all events must equal 1, we have:

P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3, P(A) = 1/2

Similarly, for Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3, P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(N-1, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(N-1, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either deck do not depend on the number of cards N, so we can drop it from our calculations.

Now, the posterior odds are:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

We can find the probabilities of the events A and B given the observed data by using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

As we don't know the exact number of cards in the decks, we cannot calculate the exact odds. However, we can express the odds as a ratio of probabilities:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

To find the exact value of the odds, we need to know the number of cards in the decks, but the ratio of the probabilities should be greater than 1 if the drawn cards were more likely to come from Deck A.
