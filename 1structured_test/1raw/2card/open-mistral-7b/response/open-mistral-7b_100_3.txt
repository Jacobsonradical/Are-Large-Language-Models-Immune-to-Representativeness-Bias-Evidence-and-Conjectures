To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from both decks A and B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(24, 4)

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

To find P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) and P(Deck B | 3X, 1O), we need to normalize the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A and Deck B.

After calculating and normalizing, the posterior odds are approximately:

{odds: 2.77}

So, given the observed data (drawing 3X and 1O cards), it is about 2.77 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
