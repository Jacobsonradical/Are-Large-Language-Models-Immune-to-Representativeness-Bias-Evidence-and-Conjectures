To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that we drew 4 cards, and then compare these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|data).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 7 X's and 13 O's in Deck A, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from 20 cards:

P(A|data) = C(7,3) * C(13,1) / C(20,4)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 10 X's and 16 O's in Deck B, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from 26 cards:

P(B|data) = C(10,3) * C(16,1) / C(26,4)

Now that we have P(A|data) and P(B|data), we can calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B:

{odds: P(A|data) / P(B|data)}

Note that it's not necessary to calculate the exact values of P(A|data) and P(B|data) to find the odds. The odds can be calculated directly from the probabilities, as long as we keep the ratios between them the same:

{odds: P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [C(7,3) * C(13,1)] / [C(10,3) * C(16,1)] / [C(13,1) * C(16,3)] / [C(10,1) * C(16,3)]}

The given problem does not provide enough information to calculate the exact values of the combinations, so the answer must be expressed as a ratio of ratios.
