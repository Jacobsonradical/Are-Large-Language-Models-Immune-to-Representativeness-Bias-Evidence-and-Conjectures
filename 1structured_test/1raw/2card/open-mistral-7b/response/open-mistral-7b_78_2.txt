To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

From Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X)
P(O) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O)
P(3X,1O) = P(X)^3 * P(O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

From Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3
P(3X,1O) = P(X)^3 * P(O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2/3) / (2/3) = 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1:1, which means there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other based on the given information.
