To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the data given Deck A and Deck B. Let's denote the total number of cards in either deck as N.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1) / C(N, 4)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1) / C(N, 4)

The number of ways to choose 3X and 1O is the same in both decks, so the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Since the number of ways to choose 3X and 1O is the same in both decks, we can simplify the likelihood ratio to:

LR = (C(N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1)) / (C(N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1))

LR = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the posterior odds are also 1:

{odds: 1}

This means that, given the observed data, we have no reason to believe that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A more or less than Deck B.
