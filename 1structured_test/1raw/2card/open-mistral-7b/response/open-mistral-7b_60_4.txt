To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

For Deck A:
P(A|3X,1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3X from 2/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from 1/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)

Calculating the numerator, we have 3C3 * 4C1 = 84 ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck A.

The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A is C(2/3 * 52, 4) + C(1/3 * 52, 4).

For Deck B:
P(B|3X,1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3X from 1/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from 2/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)

Calculating the numerator, we have 3C3 * 4C1 = 84 ways to choose 3X and 1O from Deck B.

The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B is C(1/3 * 52, 4) + C(2/3 * 52, 4).

Now we have the likelihoods of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck. To find the posterior odds, we divide the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A by the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

{odds: P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)}

Since the probabilities P(A|3X,1O) and P(B|3X,1O) are equal (84), the posterior odds are also equal to 1.

However, this result seems counterintuitive because Deck A has more X-marked cards than Deck B. This might indicate an issue with the Bayes' theorem or the assumptions made in the question. It would be worth revisiting the question or the assumptions to see if there's any mistake.
