To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that we have drawn 4 cards.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)

P(3X, 1O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A) (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in one draw from Deck A)
                   = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                   = 8/243

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)

P(3X, 1O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B) (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in one draw from Deck B)
                   = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                   = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
                 = (8/243) / (1/27)
                 = 8/27

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8/27.
