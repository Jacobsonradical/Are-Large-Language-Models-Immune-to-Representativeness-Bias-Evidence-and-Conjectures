To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck, and then calculate the prior odds.

The prior odds are the odds of choosing Deck A over Deck B before drawing any cards. Since Deck A has twice as many X-marked cards as Deck B, we can say that Deck A is twice as likely to be chosen as Deck B. So, the prior odds are:

{prior odds: 2}

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck:

In Deck A:
L(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = (8/81)

In Deck B:
L(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = (2/81)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: L(3X, 1O | Deck A) / L(3X, 1O | Deck B)}

{odds: (8/81) / (2/81)}

{odds: 4}

So, given the observed data of drawing 3X and 1O cards, the posterior odds favor Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, over Deck B, with a ratio of 4:1.
