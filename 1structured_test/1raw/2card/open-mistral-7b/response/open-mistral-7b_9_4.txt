To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1
                      = (8/27) * (1/3) * (2/3)
                      = (8/654)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                      = (1/27) * (4/9)
                      = (4/243)

Now, we have the likelihood ratios:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = (8/654) / (4/243)
    = 2/17

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:
odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(Deck A) * LR / P(Deck B)
                        = (2/3) * (2/17) / (1/3)
                        = 8/17

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, is 8 to 17.
