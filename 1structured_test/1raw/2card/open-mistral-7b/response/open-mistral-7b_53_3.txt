To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds (which is 1 in this case, as we have no initial belief about which deck was drawn).

Let's calculate the likelihoods:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 1/10
2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 2/15

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of Deck A) / (Likelihood of Deck B)
                          = (1/10) / (2/15)
                          = (1/10) * (3/2)
                          = 3/20

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 3/20. It's less than 1, indicating a lower likelihood that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This makes sense since Deck B has a higher probability of having 3 X's and 1 O drawn, given that it has more X's.
