To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as B.

P(A) = P(draw 3Xs and 1O from Deck A) = P(draw 3Xs from Deck A) * P(draw 1O from Deck A)

Since there are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's in Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's is C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^7 = 0.078125
The probability of drawing 1 O is C(10, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9 = 0.02197
So P(A) = 0.001684

Similarly, P(B) = P(draw 3Xs and 1O from Deck B) = P(draw 3Xs from Deck B) * P(draw 1O from Deck B)
P(draw 3Xs from Deck B) = C(13, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^10 = 0.09941
P(draw 1O from Deck B) = C(13, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^12 = 0.00806
So P(B) = 0.000768

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(draw 3Xs and 1O | Deck A) / P(draw 3Xs and 1O | Deck B)
= P(draw 3Xs and 1O from Deck A) / P(draw 3Xs and 1O from Deck B)
= 0.001684 / 0.000768
= 2.17

Finally, the posterior odds are:
odds = LR * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)
= 2.17 * 0.001684 / 0.000768
â‰ˆ 2.23

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 2.23 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
