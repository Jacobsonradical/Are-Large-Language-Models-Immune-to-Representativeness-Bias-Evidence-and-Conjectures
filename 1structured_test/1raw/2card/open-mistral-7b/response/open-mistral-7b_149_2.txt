To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A and Deck B respectively.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)
                       = 220 / 28,800
                       = 11 / 1440

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)
                       = 220 / 28,800
                       = 11 / 1440

Since the probabilities are the same for both decks, the prior odds are 1:1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O given that the deck is Deck A or Deck B. Since the probabilities are the same, the likelihood ratio is 1:1.

So the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 1}

However, since the prior odds were 1:1, the posterior odds are also 1:1. This means there is no change in our belief about which deck the cards were drawn from, based on the observed data.
