To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
A: Deck A
B: Deck B

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B

P(3X1O|A) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A
P(3X1O|B) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B

P(3X1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/273
P(3X1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratios:
L = P(3X1O|A) / P(3X1O|B) = (8/273) / (8/243)

To find the posterior odds, we multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds (P(A) / P(B)):

Posterior odds = L * (P(A) / P(B))

Since we are given that there are more X cards in Deck A than in Deck B, we can assume that P(A) > P(B). However, without additional information, we cannot provide an exact value for the prior odds. Therefore, we cannot give a definitive answer for the posterior odds.

To find the exact value, you would need to know the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, which is not provided in the question.
