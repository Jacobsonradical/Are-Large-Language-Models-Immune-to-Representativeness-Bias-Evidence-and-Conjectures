To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(26, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

= P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

= (C(26, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

After calculating, we find that the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3X and 1O from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 5.5.

So, the odds are approximately 5.5 times more in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
