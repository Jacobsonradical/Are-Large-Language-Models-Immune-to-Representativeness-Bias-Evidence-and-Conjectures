To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X,1O).

Given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(A|4X,1O) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1

Here, (2/3)C3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the cards, and (1/3)C1 represents the number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the cards.

Similarly, given that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|4X,1O) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing these two probabilities:

odds = P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O)

Calculate the probabilities and divide to get the final answer.

Note: You may need to use a calculator to find the combinations (2/3)C3 and (1/3)C1, as well as (1/3)C3 and (2/3)C1.

To calculate combinations (nCr), use the following formula:

nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of elements, r is the number of elements to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.
