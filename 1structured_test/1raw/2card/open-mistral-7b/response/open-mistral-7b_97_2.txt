To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) given Deck A versus Deck B, and then multiply it by the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                         = 35 * (1/27)
                         = 125/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(9, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                         = 84 * (1/27)
                         = 84/27

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    = 125/27 / 84/27
    = 125/84

If the prior odds were 1 (meaning we believe the deck is equally likely to be A or B), the posterior odds would be the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 125/84}
