To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A and Deck B given the observed data (drawing 3 X's and 1 O).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                 = 20 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                 = 2/9

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                 = 20 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                 = 4/9

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                             = 2/9 / 4/9
                             = 1/2

The posterior odds would then be the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds, which are the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

P(Deck A) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3
P(Deck B) = (1/3) * (2/2) = 1/3

So, the posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, compared to Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards, is 1 to 6.
