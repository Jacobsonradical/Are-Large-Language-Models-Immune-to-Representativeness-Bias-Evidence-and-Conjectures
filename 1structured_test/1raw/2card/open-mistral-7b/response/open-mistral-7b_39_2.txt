To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A versus Deck B, and then multiply these ratios by the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A: P(X3O1|A) = C(7,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6,3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = (35/216) + (20/216)
                          = 55/216

Deck B: P(X3O1|B) = C(7,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(6,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2
                          = (35/810) + (6/810)
                          = 41/810

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio (LR):

LR = P(X3O1|A) / P(X3O1|B) = 55/216 * 810 / (41/810) = 2310/41

Finally, let's assume that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B are 2:1, which means P(A) = 2/3 and P(B) = 1/3. The posterior odds are:

{odds: 2310/41}

So, given the data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the posterior odds are approximately 2310 to 41 in favor of Deck A over Deck B. This suggests that the 4 cards were more likely to have been drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
