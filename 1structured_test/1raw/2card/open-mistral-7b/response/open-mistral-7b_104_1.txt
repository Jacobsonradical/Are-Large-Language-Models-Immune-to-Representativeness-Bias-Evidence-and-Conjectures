To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of the observed data given each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|data), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|data).

First, let's calculate P(A|data). The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a card marked O is 1/3. Given that we drew 3 X's, the probability of drawing the fourth X is (2/3)*(1-2/3)^(3-1) = 2/7. The probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So, P(A|data) = (2/7)*((2/3)*(1/3))^3 * ((1/3)).

Now, let's calculate P(B|data). The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a card marked O is 2/3. Given that we drew 3 X's, the probability of drawing the fourth X is (1/3)*(2/3)^(3-1) = 1/8. The probability of drawing an O is (2/3)*(1-1/3)^(4-1) = 4/15. So, P(B|data) = (1/8)*((1/3)*(4/15))^3 * (4/15).

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we divide P(A|data) by P(B|data).

{odds: P(A|data)/P(B|data) = ((2/7)*((2/3)*(1/3))^3 * ((1/3)))/((1/8)*((1/3)*(4/15))^3 * (4/15))}

The calculation of the exact numerical value is left for you to carry out.
