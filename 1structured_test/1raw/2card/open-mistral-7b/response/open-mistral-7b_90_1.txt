To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 66, 3) * C(1/3 * 66, 1) / C(66, 4)
                       = (2^3 * 22 * 66!) / (3! * 6! * 66!)
                       = 22 * (22/6) / (6)
                       = 22 * 3.6667 ≈ 80.33

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 66, 3) * C(2/3 * 66, 1) / C(66, 4)
                       = (1^3 * 22 * 66!) / (3! * 6! * 66!)
                       = (22 * 1) / (6 * 6)
                       = 22/36
                       ≈ 0.6111

Now, to find the posterior odds, we'll divide the probability from Deck A by the probability from Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                     ≈ 80.33 / 0.6111 ≈ 132.09

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 132.09 to 1.
