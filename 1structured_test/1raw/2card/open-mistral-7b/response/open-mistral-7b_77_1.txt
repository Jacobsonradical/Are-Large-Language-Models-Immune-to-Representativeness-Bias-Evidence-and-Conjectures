To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

For Deck A:
Number of X's in deck A = 2/3 * total cards in deck A
Number of O's in deck A = 1/3 * total cards in deck A

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(total cards in deck A, 4) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                             = (total cards in deck A choose 4) * (8/27)

For Deck B:
Number of X's in deck B = 1/3 * total cards in deck B
Number of O's in deck B = 2/3 * total cards in deck B

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(total cards in deck B, 4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                             = (total cards in deck B choose 4) * (1/81)

The ratio of these two probabilities gives us the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (8/27) / (1/81)
      = 24/1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 24 to 1 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
