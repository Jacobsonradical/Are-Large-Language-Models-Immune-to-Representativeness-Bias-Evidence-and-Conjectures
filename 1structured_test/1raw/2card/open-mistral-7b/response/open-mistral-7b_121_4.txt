To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. We can calculate the probabilities of each event using the given information about the decks.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (event A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 2/3 of cards marked X in Deck A, times the probability of drawing 1 O from the 1/3 of cards marked O in Deck A.

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3 choose 3) * (1/3) * (2/3 choose 1) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3) * (2/3)^2

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (event B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 1/3 of cards marked X in Deck B, times the probability of drawing 1 O from the 2/3 of cards marked O in Deck B.

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3 choose 3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (2/3 choose 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (2/3)^2

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is the probability of drawing from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing from Deck B. Let's denote this as O(A|3X,1O):

O(A|3X,1O) = P(A) / P(B)

P(A) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3
P(B) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6

So, O(A|3X,1O) = (1/3) / (1/6) = 2/1

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the drawn cards are:

{odds: 2/1}

This means that, given the drawn cards, it is twice as likely that they were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, as from Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards.
