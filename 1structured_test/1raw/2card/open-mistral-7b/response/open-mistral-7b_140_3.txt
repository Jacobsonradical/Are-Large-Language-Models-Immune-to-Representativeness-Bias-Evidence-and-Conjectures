To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is equivalent to choosing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, which can be calculated using combinations:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                  = 4! / (3! * 1!) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                  = 4 * (2/3)^4 / 4
                  = (8/27)

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is equivalent to choosing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards, which can be calculated using combinations:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                  = 4! / (3! * 1!) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                  = 4 * (1/3)^4 / 4
                  = (1/81)

Now, let's denote the prior probability of Deck A being selected as P(A), and the prior probability of Deck B being selected as P(B). Since we don't have any information about the selection, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of Deck A being selected:

P(A|3X, 1O) = [P(A) * P(3X, 1O|A)] / [P(A) * P(3X, 1O|A) + P(B) * P(3X, 1O|B)]
                  = [(1/2) * (8/27)] / [(1/2) * (8/27) + (1/2) * (1/81)]
                  = 8/27 * 2 / (8/27 + 1/81)
                  ≈ 0.5906

Since the posterior probability is a single number, the posterior odds can be found by dividing the posterior probability of Deck A by the posterior probability of Deck B:

{odds: 0.5906 / (1/81) ≈ 81}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are approximately 81 to 1.
