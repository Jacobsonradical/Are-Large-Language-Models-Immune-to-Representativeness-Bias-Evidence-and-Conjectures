To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(13, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)
                  = 286 * (2/27) + 286 * (4/27^2 * 2)
                  = 286 * (2/27) + 286 * (8/27^3)

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(10, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)
                  = 120 * (1/27) + 120 * (1/27^2 * 4)
                  = 120 * (1/27) + 120 * (1/27^3)

Now, we can calculate the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):

P(A) = (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^(48)
P(B) = (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(48)

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

odds = [(286 * (2/27) + 286 * (8/27^3)) / (120 * (1/27) + 120 * (1/27^3))] / [(1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(48)] / [(1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(48)]

odds = [(286 * (2/27) + 286 * (8/27^3)) / (120 * (1/27) + 120 * (1/27^3))] / 1

Calculating the exact value of this odds requires significant computational power or numerical methods. However, we can see that the odds will favor Deck A, since it has more X-marked cards, and the observed result (3X and 1O) is more likely to occur in Deck A than in Deck B.
