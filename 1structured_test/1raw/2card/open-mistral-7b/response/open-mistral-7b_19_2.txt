To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the deck is Deck A, divided by the probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the deck is Deck B.

Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as nA for Deck A and nB for Deck B. Since we're given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(nA-3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(nB-3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

L = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Since we don't know the exact number of cards in each deck, we cannot calculate the exact likelihood ratio. However, we can express the ratio in terms of the unknown nA and nB, and we can make an assumption about the relative size of the decks to get a sense of the order of magnitude of the odds.

Assuming that Deck A is twice as large as Deck B (nA = 2 * nB), the likelihood ratio becomes:

L = [C(2nB-3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [C(nB-3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Simplifying the expression above, we get:

L = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = 2/1

Since the odds are the ratio of the likelihood, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 2}

This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is twice as likely to be the source of the drawn cards compared to Deck B. However, this doesn't account for any prior beliefs you may have about the relative sizes of Deck A and Deck B. If you have such prior beliefs, they should be incorporated into the Bayesian analysis by adjusting the prior odds.
