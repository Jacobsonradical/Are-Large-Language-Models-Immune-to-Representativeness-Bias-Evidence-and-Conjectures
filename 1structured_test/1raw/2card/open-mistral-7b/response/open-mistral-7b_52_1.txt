To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability that the selected deck is Deck A, and P(B) be the probability that it's Deck B. We want to find the ratio of P(A|data) to P(B|data), where data represents the observed event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(A and 3X, 1O) = P(A) * P(3X, 1O|A)
                         = (1/2) * C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                         = (1/2) * 220 * (1/27)

P(B and 3X, 1O) = P(B) * P(3X, 1O|B)
                         = (1/2) * C(18,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                         = (1/2) * 1140 * (1/27)

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(A and 3X, 1O) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(B and 3X, 1O) / P(data)

Where P(data) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O, which is the sum of P(A and 3X, 1O) and P(B and 3X, 1O).

We have:
P(A|data) = (220/1140) * (1/P(data))
P(B|data) = (1140/1140) * (1/P(data))

Finally, the posterior odds are:

{odds: (220/1140)} = {odds: 0.1915}

So, given the observed data, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is approximately 0.19 to 1 compared to Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards.
