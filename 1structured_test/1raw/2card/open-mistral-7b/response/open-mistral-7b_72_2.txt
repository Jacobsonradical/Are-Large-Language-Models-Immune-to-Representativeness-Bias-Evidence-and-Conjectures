To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

Prior odds: The probability of Deck A is 2/5, and Deck B is 3/5. So, the prior odds are:

P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 2/5 / 3/5 = 2/3

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

Deck A: P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 35/243
Deck B: P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(7, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 35/243

As the likelihoods are the same for both decks, the likelihood ratio is 1.

So the posterior odds are:

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 2/3

So, the posterior odds are still 2/3 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is still more likely than Deck B. However, the odds have not changed significantly because the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the same for both decks.
