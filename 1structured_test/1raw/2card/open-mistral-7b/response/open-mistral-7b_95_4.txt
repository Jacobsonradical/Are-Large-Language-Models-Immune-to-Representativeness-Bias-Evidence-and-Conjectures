To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of the data given Deck A and Deck B, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                               = 286

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                               = 120

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

The prior odds can be calculated as the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B based on the card compositions:

P(Deck A) = (2/3) / ((2/3) + (1/3))
                  = 2/5

P(Deck B) = (1/3) / ((2/3) + (1/3))
                  = 1/5

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 2/5 / 1/5 = 2

So, the likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 286 / 120 = 2.4

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = 2 * 2.4 = {odds: 4.8}

This means that, given the observed data, there is approximately a 4.8 times higher probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
