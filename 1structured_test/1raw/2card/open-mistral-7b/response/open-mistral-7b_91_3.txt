To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Now, we have the probabilities for both decks. We can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

posterior odds = [P(Deck A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)]

= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

= [(C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / C(52, 4)] / [(C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) / C(52, 4)]

= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

= 2/3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 2/3 compared to Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
