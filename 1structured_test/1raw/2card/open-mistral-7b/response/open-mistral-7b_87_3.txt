To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

We can calculate these probabilities using combinations and the probabilities of drawing a single X or O from each deck:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(16, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (C(30, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^4)
            = (28) * (8/273) / (1820)
            = 16 / 3087

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / (C(30, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^4)
            = (1140) * (8/1) / (1820)
            = 872 / 1820

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
     = (16 / 3087) / (872 / 1820)
     ≈ 0.0178 / 0.4756
     ≈ 0.0372 / 1
     ≈ 0.0372

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.0372. This means that Deck A is about 37.2 times less likely than Deck B to have been the deck from which the 4 cards were drawn, given that 3X and 1O were drawn.
