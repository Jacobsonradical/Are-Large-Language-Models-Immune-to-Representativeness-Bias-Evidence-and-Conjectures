To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities and calculate the odds.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) as the prior probability of drawing from Deck B
P(3X, 1O | A) as the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A
P(3X, 1O | B) as the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)
       = (C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)) / C(24, 4)
       = 220 / 4860

P(B) = Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)
       = (C(18, 3) * C(18, 1)) / C(36, 4)
       = 3660 / 87120
       = 1/24

Now, we calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck A / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)
              = C(12, 3) * C(12, 1) / C(24, 4)
              = 220

P(3X, 1O | B) = Number of ways to draw 3X and 1O from Deck B / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)
              = C(18, 3) * C(18, 1) / C(36, 4)
              = 540

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
              = (220) * (220/4860) / [(220) * (220/4860) + (540) * (1/24)]
              = 220 / (1144 + 2160)
              = 220 / 3304
              ≈ 0.0667

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
              = (540) * (1/24) / [(220) * (220/4860) + (540) * (1/24)]
              = 1 / (1144 + 2160)
              = 1 / 3304
              ≈ 0.0003

Now, we can calculate the odds:

{odds: 220 / 1}

The posterior odds are approximately 220 to 1, meaning the odds are much higher that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards.
