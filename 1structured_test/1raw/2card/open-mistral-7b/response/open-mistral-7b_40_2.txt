To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2
                          = 220 * (1/27) * (24) * (1/9)
                          = 220 * (1/81)
                          = 220/648

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^1
                          = 153 * (1/27) * (2) * (18) * (2/9)
                          = 153 * (1/81) * (36)
                          = 153 * (1/81) * 4
                          = 612/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (220/648) / (612/81)
      = 220 * (81/612)
      â‰ˆ 0.361

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.361, meaning there is slightly more evidence that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B. However, the odds are not overwhelmingly in favor of either deck.
