To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                       = 286

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                       = 120

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 286 / 120
     = 2.3833

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 2.3833 times higher than the odds they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
