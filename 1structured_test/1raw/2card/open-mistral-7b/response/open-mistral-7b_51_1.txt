To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^4)

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1 - (1/3)^4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Substitute the probabilities from above:

Posterior odds = [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A)] / [P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)]

Calculate and simplify the expression, and you will get the final answer.

The exact calculation is quite complex and would require a calculator or software to compute. If you need the exact value, I can help you with that. However, I recommend using a statistical software like R or MATLAB for an accurate calculation.
