To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then calculate the prior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

We know that in Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A are P(A) and the prior odds of drawing from Deck B are P(B). Then, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A are given by:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) * (P(A) / P(B))

We can't determine the exact values of P(A) and P(B) without more information. However, since we're interested in the relative odds, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) for simplicity. In that case, the posterior odds would be:

(P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately:

{odds: (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O))}

To calculate the exact value, you would need to know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B).
