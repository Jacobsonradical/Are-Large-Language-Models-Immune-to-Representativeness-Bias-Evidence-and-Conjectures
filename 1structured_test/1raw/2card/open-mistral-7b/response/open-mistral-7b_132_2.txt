To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                            = (35/216) * (1/27) + (20/216) * (8/27)
                            = (35/6568) + (160/6568)
                            = 195/6568

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(7, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                            = (35/216) * (1/81) + (20/216) * (16/81)
                            = (35/6568) + (320/6568)
                            = 355/6568

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                            = 195/6568 / 355/6568
                            ≈ 0.55

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds (Deck A is more likely) by the likelihood ratio:

Prior odds (Deck A > Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2
Posterior odds (Deck A > Deck B | 3X, 1O) = 2 * 0.55 ≈ 1.1

So, given the observed draw of 3X and 1O, the posterior odds favor Deck A slightly more than Deck B, but not by much. Both decks remain plausible candidates.
