To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)
                  = C(12, 3) * C(9, 1) / C(21, 4)
                  = (12! / (3! * 9!)) * (9! / (1! * 8!)) / (21! / (4! * 17!))
                  = 220 / 143

P(B|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)
                  = C(12, 3) * C(18, 1) / C(30, 4)
                  = (12! / (3! * 9!)) * (18! / (1! * 17!)) / (30! / (4! * 26!))
                  = 220 * 18 / 455
                  = 176

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}
                  = 220 / 143 / (176 * 143 / 455)
                  = 220 / 176
                  = 11 / 8

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 11 to 8.
