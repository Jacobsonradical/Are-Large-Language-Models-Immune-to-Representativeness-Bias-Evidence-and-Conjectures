To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck:

1. Deck A: P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
   = (35) * (1/27) * (1/3) + (20) * (1/27) * (2/9)
   = (35/243) + (40/81)
   = 65/243

2. Deck B: P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(8, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(7, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
   = (56) * (1/27) * (2/9) + (35) * (1/27) * (2/9)
   = (112/81)

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from each deck:

1. Deck A: P(Deck A) = 2/3
2. Deck B: P(Deck B) = 1/3

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

= P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)

= (65/243) * (2/3) / (112/81) * (1/3)

= (130/243) / (112/81)

= (130 * 81) / (243 * 112)

= 10620/277726

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 10620/277726.
