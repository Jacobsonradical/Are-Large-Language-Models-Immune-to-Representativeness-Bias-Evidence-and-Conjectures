To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then compare these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X card)
P(O) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O card)

P(3X and 1O | A) = P(3X | A) * P(1O | 3X, A)

P(3X | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^9 (number of ways to choose 3X and 6O from a deck of 12, probability of drawing 3X, and probability of drawing 6O given 3X)

P(1O | 3X, A) = 1/12 (since there is only 1 way to draw 1O given 3X from Deck A)

So, P(3X and 1O | A) = P(3X | A) * P(1O | 3X, A) = (C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^9) * (1/12)

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3

P(3X and 1O | B) = P(3X | B) * P(1O | 3X, B)

P(3X | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^15 (number of ways to choose 3X and 15O from a deck of 18, probability of drawing 3X, and probability of drawing 15O given 3X)

P(1O | 3X, B) = 1/16 (since there are 15 ways to draw 15O given 3X from Deck B, and 1 way to draw 1O)

So, P(3X and 1O | B) = P(3X | B) * P(1O | 3X, B) = (C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^15) * (1/16)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O)

P(A | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O)

P(B | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | B) / P(3X and 1O)

Since the total number of cards in Deck A and Deck B is the same (36), the probability of drawing 3X and 1O is the same for both decks. So, P(3X and 1O) is a constant that cancels out when calculating the posterior odds.

Therefore, the posterior odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O) = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(A | 3X and 1O) * (P(B) / P(A))

Since the probability of drawing from either deck is equal (let's say P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 for simplicity), the posterior odds = 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is equal to the posterior odds that they were drawn from Deck B, given the information that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O. This means that, based on this specific observation, there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other.
