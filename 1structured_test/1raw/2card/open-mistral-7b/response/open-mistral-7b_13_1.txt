To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                              = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (24) * (1/9) * (2/3)
                              = 220 * 2/27 * 1/3
                              = 160/27

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                              = (114) * (1/27) * (2/3) * (18) * (1/9) * (1/3)
                              = 114 * 2/27 * 1/3
                              = 88/27

Next, we'll calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = 160/27 / 88/27
      = 2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2:1 over Deck B. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is twice as likely to be the source of the drawn cards as Deck B.
