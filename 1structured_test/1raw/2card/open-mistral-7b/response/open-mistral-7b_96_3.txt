To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck A as X_A and O_A, respectively, and the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B as X_B and O_B, respectively.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from a total of 4 cards, and then multiplying by the probability of drawing 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck and 1 O from 1/3 of the deck:

P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                         = 4 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                         = 1/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from a total of 4 cards, and then multiplying by the probability of drawing 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck and 1 O from 2/3 of the deck:

P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                         = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                         = 2/9

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | X_A=3, O_A=1) / P(Deck B | X_A=3, O_A=1)
                         = P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) / P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck B)
                         = (1/3) / (2/9)
                         = 3/4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 3/4.
