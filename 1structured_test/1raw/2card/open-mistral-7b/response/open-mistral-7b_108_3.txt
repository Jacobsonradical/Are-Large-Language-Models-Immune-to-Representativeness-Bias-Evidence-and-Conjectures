To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):
P(3X, 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Now, let's calculate P(A) and P(B):
P(A) = (2/3) * (51/52)^4
P(B) = (1/3) * (49/52)^4

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

After calculating the above equation, we get the posterior odds as:

{odds: 1.58}

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is approximately 1.58 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
