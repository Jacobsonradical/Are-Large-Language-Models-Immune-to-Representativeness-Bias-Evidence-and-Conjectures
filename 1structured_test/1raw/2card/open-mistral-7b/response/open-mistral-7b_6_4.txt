To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event "Deck A was drawn" and B as the event "Deck B was drawn." We want to find P(A|E), where E is the event "4 cards drawn with 3 X and 1 O."

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing Deck A = 1 (since both decks have an equal chance of being drawn)
P(B) = Probability of drawing Deck B = 1

Now, let's find the likelihoods:
P(E|A) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A = C(18,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                = 81 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                = 8/243

P(E|B) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B = C(27,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                = 27 * (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
                = 2/27

Now let's apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|E) = (8/243) * 1 / [(8/243) * 1 + (2/27) * 1]
         ≈ 0.0296 / (0.0296 + 0.0074)
         ≈ 0.0296 / 0.037
         ≈ 0.7946

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.7946. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is about 0.7946 times more likely to have been drawn than Deck B.
