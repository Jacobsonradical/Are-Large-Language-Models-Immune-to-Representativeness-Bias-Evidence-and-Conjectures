To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(48, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(48-1)
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (1) * (5004) * (1/81) * (155)
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (155) * (5004/81)
                        ≈ 0.0106

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(39, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(61, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(61-1)
                        = 56 * (1/27) * (2) * (2048) * (1/9) * (155)
                        = 56 * (1/27) * (2) * (2048/9) * (155)
                        ≈ 0.0083

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     ≈ 0.0106 / 0.0083
     ≈ 1.26

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) is approximately 1.26 times higher than drawing from Deck B (where most cards are marked O).
