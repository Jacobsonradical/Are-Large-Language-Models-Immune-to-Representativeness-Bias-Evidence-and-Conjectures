To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior probabilities of drawing cards from Deck A and Deck B, and then the likelihoods of drawing 3X and 1O given each deck.

The prior probability of drawing from Deck A is the probability that Deck A was selected, which is 1/2 since both decks have an equal chance of being selected. The prior probability of drawing from Deck B is also 1/2.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(16, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                               ≈ 0.126

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                               ≈ 0.268

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                            ≈ 0.126 * (1/2) / [0.126 * (1/2) + 0.268 * (1/2)]
                             ≈ 0.212

P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                            ≈ 0.268 * (1/2) / [0.126 * (1/2) + 0.268 * (1/2)]
                             ≈ 0.368

The posterior odds are the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

{odds: 0.212 / 0.368 ≈ 0.57}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 0.57 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that, given the observed data, there is slightly more evidence for Deck A than for Deck B, but the evidence is not strong.
