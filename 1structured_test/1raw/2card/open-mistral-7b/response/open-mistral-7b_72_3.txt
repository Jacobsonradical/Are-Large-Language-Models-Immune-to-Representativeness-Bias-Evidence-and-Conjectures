To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(26, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                              = 120 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 26 * (4/27)
                              = 2240 / 2807

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(20, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                              = 120 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 20 * (1/27)
                              = 480 / 2807

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                           = 2240 / 2807  / 480 / 2807
                           = 1 / 2

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds:

Prior odds (Deck A) / Prior odds (Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 2 * (1/2) = 1}

The posterior odds favor Deck B, which has fewer X's marked on its cards, over Deck A, which has more X's marked on its cards. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's due to the specific configuration of 3 X's and 1 O drawn from each deck. With more data or a different configuration, the odds could favor Deck A.
