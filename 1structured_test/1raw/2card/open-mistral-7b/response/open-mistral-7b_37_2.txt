To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A to Deck B, and then multiply it by the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = (120 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) + (286 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1)
                          = (120/273) + (286/273)
                          = 406/273

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(13, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = (120 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) + (286 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
                          = (120/273) + (286/273)
                          = 406/273

However, since the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card is the same for both decks, the likelihood ratio is 1, and the prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B:

P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 2 * 1 = 2}

The final answer is 2, which means that, given the observation, the deck is twice as likely to be Deck A as Deck B.
