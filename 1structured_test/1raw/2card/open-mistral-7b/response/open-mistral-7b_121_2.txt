To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

P(X_3, O_1 | Deck_A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(X_3, O_1 | Deck_B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck_A | X_3, O_1) / P(Deck_B | X_3, O_1)

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:

P(Deck_A) = 1/2
P(Deck_B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratios:

LR = P(X_3, O_1 | Deck_A) / P(X_3, O_1 | Deck_B) = (8/27) / (1/27) = 8

The posterior odds are then given by:

Posterior odds = LR * P(Deck_A) / P(Deck_B) = 8 * (1/2) / (1/2) = 8

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8:1.
