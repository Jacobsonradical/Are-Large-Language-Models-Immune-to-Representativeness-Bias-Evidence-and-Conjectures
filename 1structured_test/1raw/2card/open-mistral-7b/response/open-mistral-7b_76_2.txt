To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Prior probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/216

Prior probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/216

Since the prior probabilities are equal, the odds are also equal before considering any additional information. However, the drawing of 4 cards provides us with new information that can update our beliefs.

Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A:
C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 220

And the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck B:
C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 220

Since the likelihoods are also equal, the Bayes' theorem formula simplifies to:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood of Drawing from Deck A / Likelihood of Drawing from Deck B

Posterior odds = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1:1. This means that the evidence provided by drawing 4 cards does not favor one deck over the other.
