To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

For Deck A:
Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck = C(2/3 * N, 3)
Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck = C(1/3 * N, 1)
Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A = C(N, 4)

Likelihood of choosing 4 cards from Deck A = (C(2/3 * N, 3) * C(1/3 * N, 1)) / C(N, 4)

For Deck B:
Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck = C(1/3 * N, 3)
Number of ways to choose 1 O from 2/3 of the deck = C(2/3 * N, 1)
Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B = C(N, 4)

Likelihood of choosing 4 cards from Deck B = (C(1/3 * N, 3) * C(2/3 * N, 1)) / C(N, 4)

Now, let's assume P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5 (since we assume both decks have an equal chance of being selected). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(Deck A | 4 cards) = P(4 cards | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(4 cards | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(4 cards | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

We can now calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 4 cards) / P(Deck B | 4 cards)

To find the actual numbers, you'll need to substitute the values of N and the likelihoods into the Bayes' theorem equation. It's important to note that the actual values will depend on the total number of cards in the decks, which is not provided in the question.
