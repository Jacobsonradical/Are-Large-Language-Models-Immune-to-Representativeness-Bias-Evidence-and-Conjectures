To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them based on the observed data.

The prior odds are the odds of Deck A being selected before drawing any cards, divided by the odds of Deck B being selected. Since the selection of the deck is random, we can assume equal probability for both decks, so the prior odds are 1.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^0
                           ≈ 0.167 + 0.067 = 0.234

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^0
                           ≈ 0.047 + 0.014 = 0.061

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.234 / 0.061 ≈ 3.85

The posterior odds are then obtained by multiplying the prior odds (1) by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 3.85 ≈ 3.85

So, the posterior odds are approximately 3.85, meaning that, given the observed data, Deck A is about 3.85 times more likely to be the deck from which the 4 cards were drawn than Deck B.
