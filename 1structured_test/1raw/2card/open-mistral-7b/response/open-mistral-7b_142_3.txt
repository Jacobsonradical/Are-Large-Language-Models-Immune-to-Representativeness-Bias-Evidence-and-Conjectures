To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1 (since both decks have an equal chance of being drawn)
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 1 = 0

Now, let's find the likelihoods:
L(A | 3X, 1O) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A
           = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
           = 220 * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^1 + 220 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^2 * (0.4)^1 + 12 * (0.4)^1 * (0.6)^3
           = 0.014784

L(B | 3X, 1O) = Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B
           = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
           = 1820 * (0.1)^3 * (0.9)^1 + 27648 * (0.1)^2 * (0.9)^2 * (0.1)^1 + 816 * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^3
           = 0.002471

Now, let's find the posterior probabilities:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = L(A | 3X, 1O) * P(A) / [L(A | 3X, 1O) * P(A) + L(B | 3X, 1O) * P(B)]
             = 0.014784 * 1 / [0.014784 * 1 + 0.002471 * 0]
             = 0.986046

P(B | 3X, 1O) = L(B | 3X, 1O) * P(B) / [L(A | 3X, 1O) * P(A) + L(B | 3X, 1O) * P(B)]
             = 0.002471 * 0 / [0.014784 * 1 + 0.002471 * 0]
             = 0

Since P(B | 3X, 1O) is zero, the odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are infinite:
{odds: infinity}

This means that, given the observed data, it is statistically more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, than from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
