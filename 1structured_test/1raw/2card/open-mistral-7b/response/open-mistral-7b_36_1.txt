To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck A and deck B.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
            = 220 * (1/27)
            = 8 * 1/9
            ≈ 0.0889

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
            = 1530 * (1/27)
            = 55 * 1/9
            ≈ 0.6111

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: 0.0889 / 0.6111 ≈ 0.1457}

So, given the observed data (drawing 3 X and 1 O cards), the posterior odds favor deck B over deck A, meaning it's slightly more likely that the cards were drawn from deck B. However, the difference is not significant, as the odds are less than 1.
