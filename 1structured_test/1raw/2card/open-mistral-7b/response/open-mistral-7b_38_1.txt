To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of doing so from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O from Deck A is 1/3. Since we want 3 X's and 1 O, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                             = 4 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                             = 4/27

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O from Deck B is 2/3. Again, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                             = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                             = 8/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
             = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
             = (4/27) / (8/27)
             = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2, or about 0.5 to 1, in favor of Deck A. This means that it is slightly more likely (by a factor of 0.5) that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
