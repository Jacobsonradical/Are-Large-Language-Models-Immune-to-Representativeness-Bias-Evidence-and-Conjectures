To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A, divided by the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^(24-4)]

2. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / [C(24, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^(24-4)]

The ratio of these probabilities gives us the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B)]

This is the probability that the drawn cards came from Deck A, given that there are 3 X and 1 O cards, divided by the probability that the drawn cards came from Deck B, given that there are 3 X and 1 O cards.
