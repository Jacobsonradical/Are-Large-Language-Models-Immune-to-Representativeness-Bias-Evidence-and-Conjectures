To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing one X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing one O is 1/3. Since we draw 3 X's and 1 O, the probabilities are as follows:
P(1X|A) = 2/3
P(1O|A) = 1/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's is (2/3) * (1 - (2/3))^2 = 1/4
The probability of drawing 1 O after drawing 3 X's is (1/3) * (1 - (1/3)) = 2/9

So, P(3X, 1O|A) = P(3X|A) * P(1O|A, 3X) = (1/4) * (2/9) = 1/18

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing one X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing one O is 2/3. Since we draw 3 X's and 1 O, the probabilities are as follows:
P(1X|B) = 1/3
P(1O|B) = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's is (1/3) * (1 - (1/3))^2 = 1/9
The probability of drawing 1 O after drawing 3 X's is (2/3) * (1 - (2/3)) = 1/3

So, P(3X, 1O|B) = P(3X|B) * P(1O|B, 3X) = (1/9) * (1/3) = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/18) / (1/27) = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2 compared to Deck B. This means that Deck B is slightly more likely to have been drawn, given the observed data. However, note that the data provides only limited information, and the actual probability could be different.
