To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them.

Let's denote the number of Xs and Os in the drawn cards from Deck A as A_X and A_O, and the number of Xs and Os in the drawn cards from Deck B as B_X and B_O. We know that A_X + A_O = 3 and A_O = 1, and similarly for Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(A_X = 3, A_O = 1 | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(B_X = 3, B_O = 1 | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

{odds: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)}

To simplify the expression, we can cancel out the common term (1/3)^3:

{odds: (2/3) / (2/3)}

Since the odds of two equal quantities is 1, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1. This means that given the observed data, it is just as likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as from Deck B.
