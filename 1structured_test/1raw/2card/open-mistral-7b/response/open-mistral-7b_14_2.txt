To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(16, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)
                                 ≈ 0.1053

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)
                                 ≈ 0.0685

Now, we can calculate the odds:

{odds: 0.1053 / 0.0685 ≈ 1.53}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is approximately 1.53 times higher than the odds of drawing them from Deck B, the deck with more O-marked cards.
