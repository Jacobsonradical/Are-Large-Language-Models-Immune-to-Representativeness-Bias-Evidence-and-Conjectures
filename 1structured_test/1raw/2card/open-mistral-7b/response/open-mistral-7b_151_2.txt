To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide them. Let's first find the probabilities:

1. Deck A: Probability of drawing 3X's and 1O = (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * ((2/3)C1) = (8/27) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 8/243

2. Deck B: Probability of drawing 3X's and 1O = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/9) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (8/243) / (2/81)} = {odds: 8/243 / 2/81} = {odds: 8/243 * 81/2 / 2/81} = {odds: 64/243}

So, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards marked X and O from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards, is 64/243.
