To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Let's calculate P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B):

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
                    = 220 * (1/27) + 220 * (4/27)^2 * (2/3) + 12 * (1/27)^3
                    ≈ 0.2247

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(36, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
                     = 840 * (1/27) + 405 * (4/27)^2 * (1/3) + 36 * (1/27)^3
                     ≈ 0.1241

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 0.2247 / 0.1241 ≈ 1.81

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 1.81 times higher than the probability of them being drawn from Deck B.
