To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a card with an X from Deck A as p(X|A) and the probability of drawing a card with an X from Deck B as p(X|B).

From the problem, we know:
p(X|A) = 2/3,
p(X|B) = 1/3,
p(A) = P(Deck A is selected) = P(Deck B is selected) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)

The prior odds are given by the ratio of the probabilities of the two events:

p(A|X_3O_1) / p(B|X_3O_1) = p(A) * p(X_3O_1|A) / p(B) * p(X_3O_1|B)

Now, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

p(X_3O_1|A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 120 * (1/27) * (1/3) = 4/27
p(X_3O_1|B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 1140 * (1/27)^3 * (2/9) = 44/81

Now we can calculate the prior odds:

p(A|X_3O_1) / p(B|X_3O_1) = (1/2) * (4/27) / (1/2) * (44/81) = 4 / 44

Since the odds ratio is equal to the ratio of the probabilities, the answer is:

{odds: 4/44}

However, since the question asks for the odds in favor of Deck A, we can rewrite the answer as:

{odds: 4 : 44} or {odds: 0.0909 : 1}

This means that, given the observed data, the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.0909, while the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck B is approximately 0.9091. So, based on the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B, but the evidence is not very strong.
