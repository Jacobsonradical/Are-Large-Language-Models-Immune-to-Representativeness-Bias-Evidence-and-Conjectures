To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote event A as drawing from Deck A and event B as drawing from Deck B. We have:

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B

We are given that:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being drawn)

Let's denote the event of drawing 3X and 1O as E. We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E).

First, let's calculate the probabilities of the events E given Deck A and Deck B:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of the events A and B given E:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
      = (8/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27) * P(A) + (8/27) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we have:

P(A|E) = (8/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27) * (1/2) + (8/27) * (1/2)]
       = 8/54

Similarly,

P(B|E) = (8/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27) * (1/2) + (8/27) * (1/2)]
       = 8/54

Since P(A|E) = P(B|E), the posterior odds are 1:1. This means that, given the information, we cannot make a stronger inference that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, or vice versa.

Therefore, {odds: 1}
