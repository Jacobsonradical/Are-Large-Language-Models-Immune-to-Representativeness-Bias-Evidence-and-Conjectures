To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Let L(A|4X1O) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A, and L(B|4X1O) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B.

Given that we have 4 cards and 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, the probability of this event happening in Deck A is:

L(A|4X1O) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1 + C(4, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Similarly, the probability of this event happening in Deck B is:

L(B|4X1O) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

P(A|4X1O) = P(A) * L(A|4X1O) / [P(A) * L(A|4X1O) + P(B) * L(B|4X1O)]

However, without the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can't calculate the exact posterior odds. The prior probabilities would depend on the specific setup or context of the problem, such as whether the decks are equally likely to be drawn or not.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a numerical answer for the posterior odds.
