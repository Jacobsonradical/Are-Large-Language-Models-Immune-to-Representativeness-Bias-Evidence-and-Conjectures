To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's calculate the likelihood first:

1. For Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 2/3 X-marked cards and 1 O from the 1/3 O-marked cards. This can be calculated as C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3), where C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time.

2. For Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 1/3 X-marked cards and 1 O from the 2/3 O-marked cards. This can be calculated as C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)}

Please note that you may need to calculate the combinations and powers to get the exact numerical value of the odds. The above answer gives you the concept and the structure to calculate the odds.
