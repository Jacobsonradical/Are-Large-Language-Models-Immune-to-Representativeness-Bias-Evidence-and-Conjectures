To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event D_A as drawing 4 cards from Deck A and D_B as drawing 4 cards from Deck B. We're given P(D_A) = 1/2 (since the choice of deck is random), and we want to find P(D_A|E), where E is the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

First, we need to calculate P(E|D_A) and P(E|D_B).

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
P(E|D_A) = P(3X and 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12,3) / C(12,4)

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
P(E|D_B) = P(3X and 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(16,3) / C(16,4)

Now, we can calculate P(D_A|E):

P(D_A|E) = P(E|D_A) * P(D_A) / [P(E|D_A) * P(D_A) + P(E|D_B) * P(D_B)]

Substituting the values and simplifying:

P(D_A|E) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 420 / 288] * (1/2) / [((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 420 / 288) * (1/2) + ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 280 / 495) * (1/2)]

Simplifying further, we get:

P(D_A|E) = 1/2

Since the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B are equal, the posterior odds are also equal to 1, meaning there's no evidence to favor one deck over the other given the observed data.
