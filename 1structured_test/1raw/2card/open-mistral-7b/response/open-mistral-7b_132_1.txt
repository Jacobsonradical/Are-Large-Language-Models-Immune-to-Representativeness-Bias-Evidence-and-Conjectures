To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A:
P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(drawing 4 cards from A)
                   = 220 * (1/27) * (1/2)
                   = 220/297

For Deck B:
P(B|3X, 1O) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(drawing 4 cards from B)
                   = 1140 * (1/27) * (2/2)
                   = 1140/54

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
      = 220/297 / 1140/54
      = (220/297) * (54/1140)
      = 1212/2867

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, compared to Deck B is 1212/2867.
