To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (event A) is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 2/3 * 52 + 1/3 * 52 = 34 cards.

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 34 cards is given by the combination formula: C(34, 3) * C(34, 1) = 34! / (3! * (34-3)!) * 34! / (1! * (34-1)!)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (event B) is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 1/3 * 52 + 2/3 * 52 = 38 cards.

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 38 cards is given by the combination formula: C(38, 3) * C(38, 1) = 38! / (3! * (38-3)!) * 38! / (1! * (38-1)!)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|B) * P(B))

where data denotes the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O

Given that the number of X's and O's in both decks are the same (3 and 1), P(data|A) = P(data|B)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

odds = (P(A)) / (P(B)) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
