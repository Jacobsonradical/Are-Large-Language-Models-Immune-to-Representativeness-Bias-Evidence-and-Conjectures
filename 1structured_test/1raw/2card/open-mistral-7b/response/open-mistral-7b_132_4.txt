To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X1O).

For Deck A:
P(A|4X1O) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 * (1/2) * (2/3)C1
                 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (1/2) * (1/3)
                 = 1 / 18

For Deck B:
P(B|4X1O) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 * (1/2) * (1/2)C1
                 = (1! * 2!) / (3! * 3!) * (1/2) * (1/4)
                 = 1 / 36

Now, let's assume the prior probability of each deck is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The posterior odds are calculated as:

P(A|4X1O) / P(B|4X1O) = P(A) * P(4X1O|A) / P(B) * P(4X1O|B)
                            = (1/2) * (1/18) / (1/2) * (1/36)
                            = 1 / 36

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 1/36 compared to Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
