To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior probabilities and the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A, and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The prior probabilities are:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1/2 (since we don't know which deck was drawn)
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2*1)*(1/6) = 1/6

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1*1)/(6*2) = 1/12

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Calculating the numerator:
(2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 * (1/2) = 1/24

Calculating the denominator:
[((2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1) * (1/2)] + [((1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1) * (1/2)]

Simplifying, we get:
(1/24) + (1/48) = 1/16

So, the posterior probability of drawing from Deck A given the drawn cards is 1/16.

Similarly, the posterior probability of drawing from Deck B given the drawn cards is 1/48.

Now, we can calculate the odds:

Posterior odds = Odds ratio * Prior odds

The odds ratio is the ratio of the two posterior probabilities:

Odds ratio = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O) = (1/16) / (1/48) = 1/3

Since the prior odds are equal (1:1), the final answer is:

{odds: 1/3}

The final answer is that the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A are 1/3 compared to Deck B. This means that, given the drawn cards, it is slightly more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck B than Deck A. However, the difference is not significant because the prior odds were equal, and the sample size was small (only 4 cards were drawn).
