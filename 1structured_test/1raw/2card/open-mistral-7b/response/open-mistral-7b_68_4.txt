To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck A) + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1 * P(Deck A)
                          = (220 * (1/27)) + (495 * (1/81))
                          = 795/273

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck B) + C(24, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1 * P(Deck B)
                          = (220 * (1/27)) + (1140 * (1/81))
                          = 1360/273

Now, we know that P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2, since both decks are equally likely to be chosen.

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
                    = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                    = 795/273 / 1360/273
                    = 795/1360
                    = 7/16

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 7/16.
