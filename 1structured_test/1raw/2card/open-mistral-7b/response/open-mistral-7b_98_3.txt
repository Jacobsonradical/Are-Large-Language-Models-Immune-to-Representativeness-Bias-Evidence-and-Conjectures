To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   P(XXOO | Deck A) = (2/3)C2 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1
   = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 2!) * (1/3) * (2/3)
   = 1 / (27 * 2)
   = 1 / 108

2. Deck B:
   P(XXOO | Deck B) = (1/3)C2 * (2/3)C2
   = (1! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (2/3) * (2/3)
   = 1 / 27

Now, we need to find the prior probabilities of each deck:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | XXOO) / P(Deck B | XXOO) = [P(XXOO | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(XXOO | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
                                         = [(1/108) * (1/2)] / [(1/27) * (1/2)]
                                         = 1 / 108 * 2 / (1/27 * 2)
                                         = 1 / 108 * 2 / 1/27
                                         = 54

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 54 to 1.
