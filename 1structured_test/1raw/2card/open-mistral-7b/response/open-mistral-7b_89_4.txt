To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data. Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O|A), and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O|B).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|A):

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(4, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Using the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), we get:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^4 + (4 choose 2) * (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 + (4 choose 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O|B):

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(4, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 + C(4, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

Calculate the probabilities and likelihood ratio to find the posterior odds.
