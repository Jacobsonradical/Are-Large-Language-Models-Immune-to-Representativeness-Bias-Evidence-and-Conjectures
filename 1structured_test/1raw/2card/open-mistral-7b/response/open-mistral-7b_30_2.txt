To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. This can be calculated using combinations:

P(A|3X,1O) = C(12,3) * C(6,1) / C(24,4)

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X,1O) = C(8,3) * C(12,1) / C(24,4)

Now, let's assume the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|3X,1O) = [P(A) * P(3X,1O|A)] / [P(A) * P(3X,1O|A) + P(B) * P(3X,1O|B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

{odds: [P(A|3X,1O)] / [P(B|3X,1O)]} = [(C(12,3) * C(6,1)) / C(24,4)] / [(C(8,3) * C(12,1)) / C(24,4)]

Simplifying the above expression will give us the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 are X's and 1 is O.
