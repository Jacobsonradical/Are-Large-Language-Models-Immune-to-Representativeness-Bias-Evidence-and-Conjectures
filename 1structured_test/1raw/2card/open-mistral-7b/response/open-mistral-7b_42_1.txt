To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A to the probability of drawing the same number of cards with the same marks from Deck B.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                          = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                          = 220/243

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 406 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                          = 812/243

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                        = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                        = (220/243) / (812/243)
                        = 220 / 812
                        â‰ˆ 0.271

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.271. This means that, given the observed data, there is about 27.1% more evidence for the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
