To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) and Deck B (P(3X, 1O | Deck B)):

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 35/243

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 20/81

Now, let's calculate the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B:

P(Deck A) = (2/3) * (1) = 2/3
P(Deck B) = (1/3) * (1) = 1/3

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 2/3 / 1/3 = 2

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 35/243 / 20/81 = 7/12

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 2 * 7/12 = 14/12 = 7/6

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 7/6 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
