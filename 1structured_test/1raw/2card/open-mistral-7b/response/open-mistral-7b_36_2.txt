To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = Number of X's in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
         = 2/3

P(O|A) = Number of O's in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
         = 1/3

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (P(X|A))^3 * (P(O|A))
                 = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = Number of X's in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
         = 1/3

P(O|B) = Number of O's in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
         = 2/3

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O|B) = (P(X|B))^3 * (P(O|B))
                 = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's assume the prior probability of drawing a card from Deck A or Deck B is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
                       = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)
                       = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)
                       = (2/9) / (1/9)
                       = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2:1. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is twice as likely to be the source of the 4 drawn cards as Deck B.
