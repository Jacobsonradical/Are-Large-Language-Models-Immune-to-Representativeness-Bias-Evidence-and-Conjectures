To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is calculated as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck)

There are (2/3)C3 ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck, which is (2/3)(2/2-1) = 2/6 = 1/3.
There are (1/3)C1 ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck, which is (1/3).
The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck is (2/3)C4 + (1/3)C4, which is (2/3)(2/2-1-2+1) + (1/3)(1/2-1) = 15/24 + 0 = 15/24 = 5/8.

So, P(A|3X, 1O) = (1/3) * (1/3) / (5/8) = 1/12

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is calculated as follows:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O from 2/3 of the deck) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck)

There are (1/3)C3 ways to choose 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck, which is (1/3)(1/2-1-2+1) = 0.
There are (2/3)C1 ways to choose 1 O from 2/3 of the deck, which is (2/3).
The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck is (1/3)C4 + (2/3)C4, which is (1/3)(1/2-1-2+1-3+2) + (2/3)(2/2-1) = 0 + 2/8 = 1/4.

So, P(B|3X, 1O) = (0) * (1/3) / (1/4) = 0

Since P(B|3X, 1O) = 0, the odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is infinite:

{odds: infinity}

This means that, given the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, it is infinitely more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
