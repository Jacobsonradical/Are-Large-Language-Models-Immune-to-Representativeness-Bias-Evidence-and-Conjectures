To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

We know that:

P(3X,1O|A) = C(7,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 35/84
P(3X,1O|B) = C(6,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 20/84

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities (before drawing the cards):

P(A) = (2/3) ^ 4
P(B) = (1/3) ^ 4

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|3X,1O) = P(A) * P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = P(B) * P(3X,1O|B) / P(3X,1O)

The likelihood ratio is then:

L = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Calculating the values for P(A), P(B), P(3X,1O|A), P(3X,1O|B), P(3X,1O), we get:

L = (2/3)^4 * (35/84) / ((1/3)^4 * (20/84))

Simplifying, we get:

L = 35/20

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 35 to 20.

In decimal form, the answer is:

{odds: 1.75}

So the odds are approximately 1.75 to 1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
