To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as N_A and N_B. Since we're given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, we can write:

N_A * (2/3) = Number of X's in Deck A
N_A * (1/3) = Number of O's in Deck A

Similarly, for Deck B:

N_B * (1/3) = Number of X's in Deck B
N_B * (2/3) = Number of O's in Deck B

Since we know that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, we can write:

Number of X's in Deck A = 3
Number of O's in Deck A = 1

Number of X's in Deck B = N_B * (1/3)
Number of O's in Deck B = N_B * (2/3)

Now, we can find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3 X's from Deck A) = C(Number of X's in Deck A, 3) * (Number of X's in Deck A / N_A)^3 * ((Number of O's in Deck A / N_A)^1)

P(1 O from Deck A) = C(Number of O's in Deck A, 1) * ((Number of O's in Deck A / N_A)^1)

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = P(3 X's from Deck A) * P(1 O from Deck A)

Similarly for Deck B:

P(3 X's from Deck B) = C(Number of X's in Deck B, 3) * ((Number of X's in Deck B / N_B)^3) * ((Number of O's in Deck B / N_B)^1)

P(1 O from Deck B) = C(Number of O's in Deck B, 1) * ((Number of O's in Deck B / N_B)^1)

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = P(3 X's from Deck B) * P(1 O from Deck B)

Now, let's find the prior odds. Since we don't know the sizes of the decks, we can't directly calculate them. However, by definition, the prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the two events before considering the evidence. Since both decks have an equal chance of being selected, the prior odds are 1.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Unfortunately, without knowing the sizes of the decks, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the posterior odds. However, we can say that since Deck A has a higher proportion of X's, the posterior odds will favor Deck A over Deck B.
