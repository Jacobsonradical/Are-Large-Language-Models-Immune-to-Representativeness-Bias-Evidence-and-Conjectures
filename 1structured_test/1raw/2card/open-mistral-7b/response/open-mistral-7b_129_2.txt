To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A, and divide it by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities for Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(24, 4)

Where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Calculating this gives us:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) ≈ 0.0474

Now let's calculate the probabilities for Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(16, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(32, 4)

Calculating this gives us:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 0.1016

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

odds ≈ 0.0474 / 0.1016 ≈ 0.0467

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.0467, meaning there is about a 4.67% higher probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
