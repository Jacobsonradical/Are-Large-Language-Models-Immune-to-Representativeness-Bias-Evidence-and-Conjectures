To find the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's drawn from Deck A as O_A. Similarly, let X_B and O_B represent the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(X_A = 3, O_A = 1 | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 51, 3) * (1/3 * 51)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(X_B = 3, O_B = 1 | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * (2/3 * 52)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)] * [P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)]

Since we don't have specific information about the total number of cards in each deck, we can't calculate the exact probability of drawing from each deck (P(Deck A) and P(Deck B)). However, since both decks have the same number of cards, the odds will only depend on the probabilities of drawing X and O from each deck.

The ratio of these probabilities is:

(P(X | Deck A) / P(O | Deck A)) / (P(X | Deck B) / P(O | Deck B))

Using the given information, we have:

P(X | Deck A) = 2/3
P(O | Deck A) = 1/3
P(X | Deck B) = 1/3
P(O | Deck B) = 2/3

So the ratio is:
(2/3) / (1/3) / ((1/3) / (2/3)) = 2

However, since we don't have the exact probabilities of drawing from each deck, the final odds value will depend on these probabilities. The above ratio gives us an indication that the odds of drawing from Deck A are higher than Deck B given that 3X and 1O were drawn, assuming the total number of cards is the same in both decks.
