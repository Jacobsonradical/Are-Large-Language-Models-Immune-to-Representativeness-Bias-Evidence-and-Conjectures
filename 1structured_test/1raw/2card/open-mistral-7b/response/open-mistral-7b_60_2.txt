To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, and vice versa for Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

odds = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

However, since we don't have any prior information about the likelihood of Deck A or Deck B being chosen, we can't calculate the exact odds. In Bayesian statistics, the prior probability should be incorporated, but in this case, it's not provided. So, the final answer depends on the specific prior probability assigned to Deck A and Deck B.
