To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B, given the observed data.

Let's denote the number of X cards in the selected deck as X, and the number of O cards as O. According to the problem, we know that X = 3 and O = 1.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Plugging in the probabilities:
LR = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplifying the expression:
LR = (8/27) / (1/27)

LR = 8

Since the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B are 2:1 (because Deck A has more X-marked cards), the posterior odds are:

{odds: 8}

This means that, given the observed data, the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8 times more likely than from Deck B.
