To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O). Since there are 4 cards drawn, there are C(4,3) = 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / (C(13, 4) * (2/3)^13)

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O). Since there are 4 cards drawn, there are C(12, 3) = 12 choose 3 = 220 ways to choose 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) / (C(12, 4) * (1/3)^12)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)}

Calculating these probabilities should give you the final answer.
