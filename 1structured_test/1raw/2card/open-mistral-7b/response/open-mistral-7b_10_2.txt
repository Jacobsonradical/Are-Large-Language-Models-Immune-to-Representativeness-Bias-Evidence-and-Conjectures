To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(10, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                      = (35) * (1/27) + (120) * (1/27)
                      = 158/27

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                      = (20) * (1/27) + (120) * (1/27)
                      = 140/27

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2/1 because Deck A has twice as many X-marked cards as Deck B.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
                      = (158/27) * (2/3) / (158/27 + 140/27)
                      = (316/27) / (298/27)
                      = 316/298 â‰ˆ 1.063

Since the posterior odds are greater than 1, it is more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
