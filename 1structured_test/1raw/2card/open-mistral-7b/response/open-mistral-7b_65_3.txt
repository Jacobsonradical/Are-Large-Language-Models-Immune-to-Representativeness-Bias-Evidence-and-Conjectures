To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * C(24, 1) * (1/9)
                        = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 24
                        = 220 * (1/648)

Next, we'll calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^2
                        = 816 * (1/27) * (2/3) * C(18, 1) * (1/9)
                        = 816 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 18
                        = 288 * (2/81)

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing these probabilities:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B))
      = (220 * (1/648)) / (288 * (2/81))
      = (220/648) / (576/81)
      = 220/576 * 81/576
      = 1764/4096
      = 7/16

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 7/16. This means that, given the observed event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the probability of Deck A being the chosen deck is 7/16 times larger than the probability of Deck B being the chosen deck.
