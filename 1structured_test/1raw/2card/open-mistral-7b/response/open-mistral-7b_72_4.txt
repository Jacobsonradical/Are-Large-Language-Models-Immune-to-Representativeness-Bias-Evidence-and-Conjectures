To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide the probabilities.

For Deck A:
P(X3O1 | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

For Deck B:
P(X3O1 | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | X3O1) / P(Deck B | X3O1)
     = (P(X3O1 | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(X3O1 | Deck B) * P(Deck B))

Since the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

Substitute the probabilities and calculate:

odds = (P(X3O1 | Deck A) / P(X3O1 | Deck B))
     = ((C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)) / (1/2)
     = (C(12, 3) * C(18, 1)) / (C(18, 3) * C(12, 1))
     = (4410 / 18) / (270 / 12)
     = 110 / 3

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 110 to 3.
