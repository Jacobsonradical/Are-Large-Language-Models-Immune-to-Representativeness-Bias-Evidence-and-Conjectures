To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update them with the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The prior odds are the odds of Deck A being chosen over Deck B, which is given by the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B:

P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(12, 4) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

where C(12, 4) is the number of combinations of choosing 4 cards out of 12, which is 495.

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(18, 4) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

where C(18, 4) is the number of combinations of choosing 4 cards out of 18, which is 15,504.

Now we can calculate the prior odds:

P(A) / P(B) = (P(A|3X, 1O) * P(B)) / (P(B|3X, 1O) * P(A))

Since we don't have the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being chosen, we can't calculate the exact prior odds. However, if we assume that both decks have an equal chance of being chosen (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), then the prior odds would be:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (495 * (1/3)^4) / (15,504 * (2/3)^4)

This is the ratio of the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, given that they have an equal chance of being chosen.

Therefore, the posterior odds, assuming equal prior probabilities, would be:

{odds: (495 * (1/3)^4) / (15,504 * (2/3)^4)}
