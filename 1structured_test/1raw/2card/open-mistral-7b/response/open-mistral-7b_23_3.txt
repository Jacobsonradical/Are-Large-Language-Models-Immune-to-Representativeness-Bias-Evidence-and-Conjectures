To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's first find the probabilities:

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = Number of X cards in A / Total number of cards in A
        = 2/3

P(O|A) = Number of O cards in A / Total number of cards in A
        = 1/3

P(3X1O|A) = P(XXOXX|A) * P(O|A) + P(XXOOX|A) * P(O|A) + P(XXOOO|A) * P(O|A) + ... (where X represents a drawn X card and O represents a drawn O card)

Since the order of drawing doesn't matter, we can simplify the calculation by considering the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from their respective groups, then multiplying the probabilities:

Number of ways to choose 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck = C(2/3, 3) = (2/3)! / (3!(2/3-3)!)
Number of ways to choose 1 O from 1/3 of the deck = C(1/3, 1) = (1/3)! / (1!(1/3-1)!)

So, P(3X1O|A) = [C(2/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * C(1/3, 1) * (1/3)] / [C(1, 4) * (1)^4]

Similarly, for Deck B:

P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

P(3X1O|B) = [C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * C(2/3, 1) * (2/3)] / [C(1, 4) * (1)^4]

Now, we can calculate the odds:

odds = P(3X1O|A) / P(3X1O|B)

This proportion can be calculated using the expression above for P(3X1O|A) and P(3X1O|B). The exact value would require actual calculations of the combinations C(n, k).
