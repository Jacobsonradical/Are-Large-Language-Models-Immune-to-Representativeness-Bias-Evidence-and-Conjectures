To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

First, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(36-1)
                                   = 220 * (1/27) * 36 * (1/81) * (63286)
                                   = 6,723,680 / 729,000

Next, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(27, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(27-1)
                                   = 840 * (1/27) * 27 * (1/81) * (19683)
                                   = 1,218,624 / 729,000

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's, 1 O)
      = P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B)
      = (6,723,680 / 729,000) / (1,218,624 / 729,000)
      = 5.52

The posterior odds are approximately 5.52 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
