To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                             = 35/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                             = 20/81

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                         = 35/81 / 20/81
                         = 7/10

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio times the prior odds, where the prior odds are assumed to be 1 (equal probability of each deck) because the selection of the deck was made at random:

{odds: 7}

So, given the drawing of 3 X's and 1 O, the posterior odds suggest that the cards were more likely to have been drawn from Deck A, which has more X-marked cards.
