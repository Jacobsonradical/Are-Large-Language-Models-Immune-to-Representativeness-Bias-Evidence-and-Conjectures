To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds of Deck A being chosen over Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in this order is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/243.

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. The probability of drawing a single X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in this order is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 1/81.

Now, we need to find the prior odds. Since Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Finally, we calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (likelihood of Deck A) / (likelihood of Deck B) * (prior odds)
                          = (8/243) / (1/81) * 1
                          = (8/243) * (81) / 1
                          = 648 / 243

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 648/243. This means that, given the observed draw of 3 X's and 1 O, Deck A is approximately 2.64 times more likely to have been drawn than Deck B.
