To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O):
1. The probability of drawing a single card from Deck A marked X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a card from Deck A marked O is 1/3.
2. The number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (since 2/3 of the deck is X's and 1/3 is O's) is C(12, 3) * C(12, 1) = 220 * 12 = 2640.
3. So, P(A|3X, 1O) = (C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1)^12 = 2640 * (1/273) = 95.72

Next, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O):
1. The probability of drawing a single card from Deck B marked X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a card from Deck B marked O is 2/3.
2. The number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 12 cards (since 1/3 of the deck is X's and 2/3 is O's) is C(12, 3) * C(12, 1) = 220 * 12 = 2640.
3. So, P(B|3X, 1O) = (C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / (1)^12 = 2640 * (1/27) = 100.8

Finally, to find the posterior odds, divide P(A|3X, 1O) by P(B|3X, 1O):

{odds: 95.72 / 100.8 â‰ˆ 0.95}

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.95, which means Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B given the observed data. However, the difference is not significant, as the odds are around 0.95.
