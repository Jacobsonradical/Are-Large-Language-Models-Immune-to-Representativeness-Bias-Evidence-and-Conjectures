To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards)

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is given by the combination formula C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4

So, P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards)

The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is the same as before, so P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4 = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of the probabilities:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)} = (8/81) / (8/81) = 1

Since the odds are 1, it means that the data does not provide any evidence to favor one deck over the other, as the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B are equal given the observed data.
