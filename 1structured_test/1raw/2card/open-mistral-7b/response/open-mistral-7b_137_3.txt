To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B, given that we have drawn 4 cards.

Let's first find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                         = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 220 * (1/9) * (2/3)
                         = 1680 / 324

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(36, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                         = 840 * (1/27) * (2/3) * 36 * (4/9) * (1/3)
                         = 840 * (2/27) * (4/3)
                         = 1024 / 27

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}
                   = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                   = (1680/324) / (1024/27)
                   â‰ˆ 1.47

The posterior odds are approximately 1.47 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a definitive conclusion.
