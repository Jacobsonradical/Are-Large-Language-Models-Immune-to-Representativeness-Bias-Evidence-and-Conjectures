To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A as P(X|A), and the probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck B as P(X|B).

From the problem statement, we know that P(X|A) = 2/3 and P(X|B) = 1/3.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. For Deck A, this would be P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/273.

For Deck B, this would be P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243.

The posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B is the ratio of these probabilities:

{odds: 273/243}

However, since the question asks for a single number, we can simplify the fraction:

{odds: 11}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 11:1.
