To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O | Deck A) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O | Deck B).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | Deck A):

1. The probability of drawing the first X is 2/3 (since 2/3 of the cards are X in Deck A).
2. The probability of drawing the next 2X is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.
3. The probability of drawing the first O is 1/3.
4. The probability of drawing the remaining 2O is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

So, P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = 2/3 * 4/9 * 1/3 * 1/9 = 1/27.

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | Deck B):

1. The probability of drawing the first X is 1/3 (since 1/3 of the cards are X in Deck B).
2. The probability of drawing the next 2X is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.
3. The probability of drawing the first O is 2/3.
4. The probability of drawing the remaining 1O is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.

So, P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 1/3 * 1/9 * 2/3 * 4/9 = 1/81.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                             = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                             = 1/27 / 1/81
                             = 1/27 * 81
                             = 3

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 3 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
