To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote Deck A as A and Deck B as B.

P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B

P(3X, 1O | A) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the deck is A
P(3X, 1O | B) = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the deck is B

We're given that P(X | A) = 2/3 and P(O | A) = 1/3. Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate P(3X, 1O | A):

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                      = 4 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                      = 4/243

Similarly, P(X | B) = 1/3 and P(O | B) = 2/3. We can calculate P(3X, 1O | B) using the binomial probability formula as well:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                      = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                      = 8/27

Now, let's find P(A | 3X, 1O):

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

We know P(A) = 2/3 and P(B) = 1/3. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) ≈ (4/243) * (2/3) / [(4/243) * (2/3) + (8/27) * (1/3)]
                    ≈ (8/1458) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                    ≈ (8/1458) / (8/27 + 8/27)
                    ≈ (8/1458) / (16/27)
                    ≈ 8/1458 * 27/16
                     ≈ 126/2806

Now, let's find P(B | 3X, 1O):

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / [(4/243) * (2/3) + (8/27) * (1/3)]
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / (8/1458 + 8/27)
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / (8/1458 + 8/27)
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / (8/1458 + 8/27)
                     ≈ (8/27) * (1/3) / (8/1458 + 8/27)
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) * (1/3) + (8/27) * (1/3)]
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
                     ≈ (8/81) * (1/3) / [(8/1458) + (8/27)]
