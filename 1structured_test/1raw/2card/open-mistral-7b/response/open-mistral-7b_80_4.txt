To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide them.

Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(6, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                            = 20 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                            = 2/27

Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(6, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                            = 20 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                            = 4/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                          = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                          = (2/27) / (4/27)
                          = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2. This means that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely given the observed data. However, since we know Deck A has more X's, it would still be more reasonable to assume that the cards were drawn from Deck A without considering the data. The data slightly favors Deck B, but this is due to chance and not a strong indication.
