To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
(2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / ((2/3)! * (1/3)!) * (1/3) * (2/3)^(4-1)
= 6 * (1/3) * (2/9)
= 24/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
(1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 2!) / ((1/3)! * (2/3)!) * (2/3) * (1/3)^(4-1)
= 2 * (2! * 1!) / ((1/3)! * (2/3)!) * (1/3) * (1/9)
= 2 * (2 * 1) * (1/3) * (1/3)
= 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 24/81 / 8/81}
{odds: 3}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, are 3 times the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
