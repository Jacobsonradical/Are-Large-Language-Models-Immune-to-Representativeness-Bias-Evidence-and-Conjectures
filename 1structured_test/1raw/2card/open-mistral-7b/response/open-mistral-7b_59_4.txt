To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the likelihood first:

1. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   The probability of drawing a single X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 1/3.
   The probability of drawing 3 X's in a row is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27.
   The probability of drawing 1 O after 3 X's is 1/3.
   So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81.

2. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   The probability of drawing a single X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single O is 2/3.
   The probability of drawing 3 X's in a row is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27.
   The probability of drawing 1 O after 3 X's is 2/3.
   So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/27.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (8/81) / (2/27) = 4/3}

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4/3.
