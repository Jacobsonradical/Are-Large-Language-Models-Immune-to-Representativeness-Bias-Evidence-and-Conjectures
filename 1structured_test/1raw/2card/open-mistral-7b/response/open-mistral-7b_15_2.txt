To find the posterior odds, we'll first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck, and then take the ratio of those probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A, and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (Number of ways to choose 3X from A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A)
                  = (C(2/3 * 52, 3)) / (C(52, 4)) * (C(1/3 * 52, 1)) / (C(52, 4))
                  â‰ˆ 0.2376

P(3X, 1O | B) = (Number of ways to choose 3X from B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B) * (Number of ways to choose 1O from B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B)
                  = (C(1/3 * 52, 3)) / (C(52, 4)) * (C(2/3 * 52, 1)) / (C(52, 4))
                  = P(3X, 1O | A)

Since P(3X, 1O | A) = P(3X, 1O | B), the data does not provide any evidence to favor one deck over the other. Therefore, the posterior odds should be 1:1.
