To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                                 = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                                 = 220/273

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                                 = 220 * (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
                                 = 220 * (1/27)^3
                                 = 220/729

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (220/273) / (220/729)
      = 729 * (220/273) / 220
      â‰ˆ 2.83

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 2.83 times higher than from Deck B.
