To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B respectively:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3)
                             ≈ 0.182

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^3)
                             ≈ 0.097

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
    ≈ 1.88

The posterior odds are then given by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds, which is 1 in this case because we have no prior information about which deck was chosen.

{odds: 1.88}

So, given the observed data, the 4 cards are about 1.88 times more likely to have been drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) than from Deck B (where most cards are marked O).
