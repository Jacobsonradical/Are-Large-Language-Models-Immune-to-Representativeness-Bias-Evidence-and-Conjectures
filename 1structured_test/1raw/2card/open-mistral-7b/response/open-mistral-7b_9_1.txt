To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, and then the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck. The prior probabilities are equal to the probability of selecting each deck, which is 1 for both since they're equally likely to be chosen.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) the probability of drawing from Deck B.

Given that Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from it is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, given that Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from it is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, the posterior odds can be calculated as the ratio of the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

To calculate these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

Given that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen, we can simplify this expression to:

odds = (P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B))

Plugging in the values for P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B), we get:

odds = (C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplifying the expression, we find that the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed sequence of 3 X's and 1 O is 2.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 2}
