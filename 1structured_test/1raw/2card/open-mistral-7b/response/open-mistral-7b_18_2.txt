To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

Deck A: P(3X, 1O | Deck A)
                 = P(3X | Deck A) * P(1O | 3X, Deck A)
                 = (C(26, 3) / C(52, 4)) * (C(26, 1) / C(26, 3))
                 ≈ 0.0168

Deck B: P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                 = P(3X | Deck B) * P(1O | 3X, Deck B)
                 = (C(17, 3) / C(52, 4)) * (C(17, 1) / C(34, 3))
                 ≈ 0.0062

Now, let's find the prior probabilities:

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = [P(Deck A) * P(3X, 1O | Deck A)] / [P(Deck B) * P(3X, 1O | Deck B)]
                       ≈ [(1/2) * 0.0168] / [(1/2) * 0.0062]
                       ≈ 2.71

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are approximately 2.71 to 1.
