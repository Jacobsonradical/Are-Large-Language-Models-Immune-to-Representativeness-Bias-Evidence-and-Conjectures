To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and multiply it by the prior odds (which is 1 in this case, as we have no initial belief about which deck was drawn).

Let's first find the likelihood for each deck:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula. The probability of drawing 3 X's in 4 draws is C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.1429. The probability of drawing 1 O in the remaining card is C(4,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 = 0.2187. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is 0.1429 * 0.2187 = 0.0309.

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's is given by the binomial probability formula. The probability of drawing 3 X's in 4 draws is C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0625. The probability of drawing 1 O in the remaining card is C(4,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 = 0.3750. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is 0.0625 * 0.3750 = 0.0234.

Now, multiply the likelihood by the prior odds (which is 1) to get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds for Deck A = Likelihood of Deck A * Prior odds = 0.0309 * 1 = 0.0309
Posterior odds for Deck B = Likelihood of Deck B * Prior odds = 0.0234 * 1 = 0.0234

Since the posterior odds for Deck A is greater than the posterior odds for Deck B, it is more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.

{odds: 0.0309 / 0.0234 = 1.31 (rounded to 4 decimal places)}

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is approximately 1.31 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
