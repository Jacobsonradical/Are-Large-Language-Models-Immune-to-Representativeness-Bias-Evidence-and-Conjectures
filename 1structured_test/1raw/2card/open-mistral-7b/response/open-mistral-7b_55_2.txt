To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that we drew 4 cards.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck A) + C(15, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/3)^1 * P(Deck A)
                                 = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (1/2) + (455) * (1/27) * (2/9) * (1/3)^2
                                 = (220/2187) + (910/243)
                                 = 1130/2187

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(15, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck B) + C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck B)
                                 = (455) * (1/27) * (2/9) * (1/2) + (220) * (1/27) * (1/9) * (1/2)
                                 = (182) / 2187

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
      = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
      = (1130/2187) * (1/2) / (182/2187) * (1/2)
      â‰ˆ 6.12

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 6.12 to 1 compared to Deck B. This means that, given the information that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, it is more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
