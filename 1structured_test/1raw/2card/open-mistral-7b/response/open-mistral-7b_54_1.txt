To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 12 * (2/9)
                = 220 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                = 220 * 2/81
                = 55/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(18, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                = 816 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 18 * (1/9)
                = 816 * (1/27) * (1/9)
                = 816 * 1/81
                = 1

Now, let's find the posterior odds (P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)):

{odds: 55/27}

The posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A is 55/27. This means that, given the observed data (drawing 3X and 1O), Deck A is approximately 55 times more likely to be the source of the drawn cards than Deck B.
