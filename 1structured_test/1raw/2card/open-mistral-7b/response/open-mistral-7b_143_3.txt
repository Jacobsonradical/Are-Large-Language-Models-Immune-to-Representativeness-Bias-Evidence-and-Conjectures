To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) * (2/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 1/16

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 2!) / (3! * 1!) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 1/12

Now, we calculate the posterior odds by dividing the likelihood of Deck A by the likelihood of Deck B:

{odds: 1/16 / 1/12 = 3/4}

So, the posterior odds are 3/4 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
