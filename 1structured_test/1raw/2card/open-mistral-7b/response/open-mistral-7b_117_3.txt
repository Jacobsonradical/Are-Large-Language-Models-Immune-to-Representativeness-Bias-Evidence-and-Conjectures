To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of the observed event (drawing 3 X and 1 O cards) for Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from both decks:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) + C(4, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3
                             = (24) * (8/27) * (1/3) + (1) * (8/27) * (27/27)
                             = 32/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) + C(4, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3
                             = (24) * (1/27) * (2/3) + (1) * (1/27) * (16/27)
                             = 16/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
          = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
          = (32/27) / (16/81)
          = 81/64

So the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards with 3X and 1O from Deck A compared to Deck B is 81/64.
