To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

First, let's find P(A|3X,1O):

In Deck A, there are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is:

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)

Now, let's find P(B|3X,1O):

In Deck B, there are 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a row is:

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, let's calculate the odds:

odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

odds = [(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3)] / [(1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

odds = 8/27

So the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, is 8/27.
