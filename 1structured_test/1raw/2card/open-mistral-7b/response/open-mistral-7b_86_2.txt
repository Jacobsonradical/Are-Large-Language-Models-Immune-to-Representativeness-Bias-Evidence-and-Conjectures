To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
A: the event that the deck is Deck A
B: the event that the deck is Deck B
X_i: the event that the i-th card drawn is marked X
O_i: the event that the i-th card drawn is marked O

We want to find P(A|X_1X_2X_3O_4), the probability that the deck is Deck A given that 3 Xs and 1 O were drawn.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|X_1X_2X_3O_4) = [P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|A) * P(A)] / [P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|A) * P(A) + P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|B) * P(B)]

First, let's calculate P(A) and P(B):
P(A) = Probability of drawing Deck A = 1
P(B) = Probability of drawing Deck B = 1

Now, let's calculate P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|A) and P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|B):

P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|A) = Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|B) = Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|X_1X_2X_3O_4) / P(B|X_1X_2X_3O_4) = [P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|A) * P(A)] / [P(X_1X_2X_3O_4|B) * P(B)] = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

odds = (2/27) / (1/27) = 2

So the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A is 2:1, meaning it is twice as likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
