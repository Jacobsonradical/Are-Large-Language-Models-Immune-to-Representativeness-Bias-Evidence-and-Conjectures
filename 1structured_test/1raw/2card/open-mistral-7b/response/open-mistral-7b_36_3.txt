To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

We are given:
P(A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing a marked X card from Deck A)
P(B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing a marked X card from Deck B)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X and 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (P(A))^3 * (P(O|A)) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:

P(3X and 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (P(B))^3 * (P(O|B)) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X and 1O) / P(B | 3X and 1O) = [P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

odds = [C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Simplifying, we get:

odds = 2/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2/3.
