To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A as P(X|A), which is 2/3. Similarly, let P(O|A) = 1/3. For Deck B, let P(X|B) = 1/3 and P(O|B) = 2/3.

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is:
P(3X and 1O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:
P(3X and 1O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)

Now we can calculate the prior odds:
Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

P(A) is the probability of selecting Deck A, which is equal to the number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A with 3X and 1O divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A. The total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 12 (3X + 9O) is C(12,4).

P(B) is the probability of selecting Deck B, which is calculated similarly.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(3X and 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X and 1O|B) * P(B)]

Calculate the values and simplify to get your answer.
