To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks, given that there are 4 cards drawn in total.

For Deck A:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck A) + C(4,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * P(Deck A)
                                      = 4 * (2/27) * (1/3) + 1 * (1/273) * (8/27)
                                      = 8/81 + 8/81
                                      = 16/81

For Deck B:
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck B) + C(4,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * P(Deck B)
                                      = 4 * (1/27) * (2/27) * (2/3) + 1 * (1/273) * (8/27) * (2/3)
                                      = 8/81 + 16/81
                                      = 24/81

Now we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from each deck:
P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
      = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
      = (16/81) * (1/2) / (24/81) * (1/2)
      = 1/2

So the posterior odds are 1 to 1, meaning there is no clear evidence to favor one deck over the other based on the information given.
