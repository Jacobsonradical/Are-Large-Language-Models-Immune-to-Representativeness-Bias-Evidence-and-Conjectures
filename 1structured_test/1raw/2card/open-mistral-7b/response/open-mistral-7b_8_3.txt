To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1
                    = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                    = 220/273

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1
                    = 1365 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                    = 1365/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
      = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
      = [(220/273) * (2/3)] / [(1365/81) * (1/3)]
      ≈ 0.1955 / 0.2593
      ≈ 0.754

So, the posterior odds are approximately 0.754 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
