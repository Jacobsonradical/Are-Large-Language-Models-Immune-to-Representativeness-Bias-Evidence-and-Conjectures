To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(36-1)
                            ≈ 0.1827

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(36, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(36-1)
                            ≈ 0.0632

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 0.1827 / 0.0632
     ≈ 2.92

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 2.92 to 1.
