To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A to Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)
                              = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * (220) * (1/9)
                              = 220 * (2/267)
                              = 120/133

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(48, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(48, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)
                              = 2002 * (1/27) * (1/3) * (48) * (1/9)
                              = 2002 * (2/267)
                              = 801/133

Now, let's calculate the odds:

Odds(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                                 = (120/133) / (801/133)
                                 = 120 / 801
                                 â‰ˆ 0.15

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are X and 1 is O, is approximately 0.15. This means that, given the observed data, Deck B is about 6.67 times more likely than Deck A. However, it's important to note that this result is based on an assumption of equal initial probabilities for Deck A and Deck B, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.
