To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote the number of cards in Deck A as A and Deck B as B. Since we know that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X's and 1/3 are O's, we can write A as 2/3 * A. Similarly, we know that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X's and 2/3 are O's, so we can write B as 1/3 * B.

Now, let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|X_3,O_1), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|X_3,O_1).

P(A|X_3,O_1) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 2/3 * A) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O out of 1/3 * A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of A)

P(B|X_3,O_1) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 1/3 * B) * (Number of ways to choose 1 O out of 2/3 * B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of B)

Since the total number of cards in Deck A and Deck B are not given, we cannot calculate the exact values of P(A|X_3,O_1) and P(B|X_3,O_1). However, we can find the ratio of these probabilities, which is what we need to find the posterior odds.

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of P(A|X_3,O_1) and P(B|X_3,O_1).
