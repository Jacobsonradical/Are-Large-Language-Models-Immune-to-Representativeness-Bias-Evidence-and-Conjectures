To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds (which is 1 in this case because we don't have any initial belief about which deck was drawn).

Let's calculate the likelihoods:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's is the probability of drawing 3 X's first (C(2/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O next (C(1/3, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's is the probability of drawing 3 X's first (C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O next (C(2/3, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)).

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

{odds: (likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)}

{odds: [C(2/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(1/3, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)] / [C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(2/3, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)]}

After calculating the binomial coefficients and simplifying the expression, we get:

{odds: (2/3) / (2/9) = 9/2}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 9:2. This means that, given the observed data, there is about 9 times more evidence for the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
