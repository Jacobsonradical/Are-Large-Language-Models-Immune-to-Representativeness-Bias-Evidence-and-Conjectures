To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X's, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * P(Deck A) + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1 * P(Deck A)

Here, C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X's, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * P(Deck B) + C(18, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1 * P(Deck B)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected, we can assume that both decks are equally likely, so P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X's, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X's, 1O)

odds = (P(3X's, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(3X's, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B))

Substituting the probabilities calculated above, we get:

odds = ((C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) + C(12, 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1) * (1/2)) / ((C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) + C(18, 4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^1) * (1/2))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

odds â‰ˆ 0.537

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.537. This means that, given the observed data, Deck A is slightly more likely than Deck B, but the difference is not large.
