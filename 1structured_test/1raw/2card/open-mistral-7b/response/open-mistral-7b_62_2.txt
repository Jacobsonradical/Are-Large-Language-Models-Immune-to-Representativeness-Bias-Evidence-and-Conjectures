To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 2/3 of X-marked cards and 1 O from the 1/3 of O-marked cards:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X|A) * P(1O|A)

P(3X|A) = C(2/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.167
P(1O|A) = C(1/3, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 = 0.167

So, P(A|3X, 1O) = 0.167 * 0.167 = 0.028

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is the probability of drawing 3 X's from the 1/3 of X-marked cards and 1 O from the 2/3 of O-marked cards:

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X|B) * P(1O|B)

P(3X|B) = C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.008
P(1O|B) = C(2/3, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 = 0.108

So, P(B|3X, 1O) = 0.008 * 0.108 = 0.000864

Now, to find the odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed data, we can divide the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = 0.028 / 0.000864 â‰ˆ 32.6

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 32.6 to 1. This suggests that the observed data is much more likely given Deck A than Deck B.
