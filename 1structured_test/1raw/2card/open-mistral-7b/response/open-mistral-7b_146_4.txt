To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's in the drawn cards as A_X and A_O for Deck A, and B_X and B_O for Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by:
P(A_X=3, A_O=1 | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:
P(B_X=3, B_O=1 | Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the odds by dividing the two probabilities:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(Deck A, 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B, 3X, 1O) = [C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]}
