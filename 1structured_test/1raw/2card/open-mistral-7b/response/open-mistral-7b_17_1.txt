To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   The probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a card marked O is 1/3.
   The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards in this order is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = (8/273).
   Since the order of drawing does not matter, we need to multiply this probability by 3! (factorial of 3) to account for all possible orders: 3! * (8/273) = (24/273).

2. Deck B:
   The probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a card marked O is 2/3.
   The probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards in this order is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = (1/226).
   Again, we need to multiply this probability by 3! to account for all possible orders: 3! * (1/226) = (6/226).

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: (24/273) / (6/226)} = {odds: (24 * 226) / (273 * 6)} = {odds: 5328 / 1642} â‰ˆ {odds: 32.57}

So, given the information, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 32.57 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
