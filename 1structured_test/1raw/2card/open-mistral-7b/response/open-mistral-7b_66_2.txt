To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X1O).

For Deck A:
P(A|4X1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck with 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's)

P(A|4X1O) = (C(2/3 * 100, 3) * C(1/3 * 100, 1)) / (C(100, 4))

For Deck B:
P(B|4X1O) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck with 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's)

P(B|4X1O) = (C(1/3 * 100, 3) * C(2/3 * 100, 1)) / (C(100, 4))

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|4X1O) / P(B|4X1O)

After calculating these probabilities, we get:

{odds: 2}

The final answer is that the posterior odds are 2 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
