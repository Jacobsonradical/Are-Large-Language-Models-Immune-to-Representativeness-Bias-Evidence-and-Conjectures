To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, and then the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards given each deck.

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of drawing from Deck A = 1 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)
P(B) = Probability of drawing from Deck B = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 1 = 0

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards given each deck:

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:
(2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:
(1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (4/9) = 4/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of drawing from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing from Deck B
                         = (8/81) / (4/81)
                         = 2/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X-marked cards) compared to Deck B (the deck with more O-marked cards) is 2:1. This means that it is twice as likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as from Deck B, given the observed data.
