To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide those probabilities.

Let's denote the number of X's drawn from Deck A as X_A and the number of O's drawn from Deck A as O_A. Similarly, let X_B and O_B denote the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) = C(18,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(18,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | X_A=3, O_A=1) / P(Deck B | X_A=3, O_A=1)

odds = [P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) / P(X_A=3, O_A=1)] / [P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) / P(X_B=3, O_B=1)]

Since the decks are equally likely before drawing the cards, we have P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

odds = [P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) / P(X_A=3, O_A=1)] / [P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) / P(X_B=3, O_B=1)] * [P(X_B=3, O_B=1) / P(X_A=3, O_A=1)]

odds = [(2/135) * (1/6)] / [(1/1287)] * [(1/2)] / [(1/182)]

To calculate this numerically, you can use a calculator to find the product of the fractions. The final answer is approximately 1.004.

Since the odds are slightly in favor of Deck A, but very close to 1, we cannot definitively say that the cards were more likely to be drawn from Deck A than Deck B, given the information provided.
