To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from each deck A and deck B.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A is given by:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
            = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
            = 220 * (1/81)
            = 22/243

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
            = 204 * (1/27) * (2/3)
            = 204 * (2/81)
            = 408/81
            = 12/27

Now, let's find the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from decks A and B:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
          = (2/3) / (1/3)
          = 2

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from decks A and B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)
                 = (22/243) / (12/27)
                 = 22/243 * 27/12
                 = 672/2916
                 = 11/48

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
              = 2 * (11/48)
              = 22/24

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 22/24.
