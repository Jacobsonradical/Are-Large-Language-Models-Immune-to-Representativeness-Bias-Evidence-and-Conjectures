To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's calculate the probability for each deck:

Deck A:
P(X|A) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
       = 2/3
P(O|A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
       = 1/3

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
            ≈ 0.1579

Deck B:
P(X|B) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
       = 1/3
P(O|B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
       = 2/3

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
            ≈ 0.0111

Now let's assume we don't know which deck was drawn and assign initial probabilities P(A) and P(B) for Deck A and Deck B respectively:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (as we don't have any prior information)

The posterior probability of Deck A being drawn is:
P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))
           ≈ (0.1579 * 0.5) / (0.1579 * 0.5 + 0.0111 * 0.5)
           ≈ 0.7727

So the odds are:
{odds: 0.7727 / 0.2273 ≈ 3.39}

The odds of drawing 4 cards marked X from Deck A (where most cards are X) are approximately 3.4 times higher than drawing 4 cards marked X from Deck B (where most cards are O).
