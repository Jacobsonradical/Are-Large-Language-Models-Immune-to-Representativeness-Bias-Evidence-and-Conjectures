To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B, given that we have drawn 4 cards.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(12, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^9
                               = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3) * 220 * (1/81) * (243/1000)
                               = 220 * 220 * (1/81)^2 * (243/1000)

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(24, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^22
                               = 220 * (1/27) * (2/27) * 220 * (2/27) * (27^2/6561)
                               = 220 * 220 * (1/27)^3 * (27^2/6561)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
      = (220 * 220 * (1/81)^2 * (243/1000)) / (220 * 220 * (1/27)^3 * (27^2/6561))

To simplify the odds, we can first find common factors:

odds = (220 * 220 * (243/1000)) / (220 * 220 * (27^2/6561))
      = (220 * 220 * 3) / (220 * 220 * 27^2)
      = 3 / (27^2)
      = 1 / 243

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/243 compared to Deck B. This means that Deck B is 243 times more likely to have been selected than Deck A, given that 3X and 1O were drawn from the selected deck. However, since the question asks for the odds in favor of Deck A, we report the result as 1/243.
