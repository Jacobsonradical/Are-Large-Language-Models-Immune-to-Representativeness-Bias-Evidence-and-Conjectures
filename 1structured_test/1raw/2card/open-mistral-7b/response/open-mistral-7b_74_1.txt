To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them by each other.

Let's first calculate the probabilities:

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
       = 2/3

P(O|A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
       = 1/3

P(3X and 1O|A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                = (2! / 3!) * (1! / 1!) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                = (2) * (1) * (1/27)
                = 2/27

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
       = 1/3

P(O|B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
       = 2/3

P(3X and 1O|B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                = (1! / 3!) * (2! / 1!) * (1/27) * (2/3)
                = (1) * (2) * (1/27) * (2/3)
                = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X and 1O) / P(B|3X and 1O)
               = P(3X and 1O|A) / P(3X and 1O|B)
               = (2/27) / (2/81)
               = 1/4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/4 compared to Deck B.
