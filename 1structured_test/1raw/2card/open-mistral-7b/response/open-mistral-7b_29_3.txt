To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2! * 1!) / (3! * 3!) * (1) = 2/27

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1! * 2!) / (3! * 2!) * (2/3) = 2/27

Since the probabilities are equal, the posterior odds are also equal:

{odds: 1}

However, this result might seem counter-intuitive, as we would expect the probability of drawing more X's from the deck with more X's to be higher. This is an example of the "Birthday Paradox" or "Bernoulli's Fallacy," where the number of successes in a small sample can be larger than expected, even if the success probability is lower. In this case, the probability of drawing a specific sequence of X's and O's is the same for both decks, despite the difference in their X-marked card proportions.
