To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B.

Let's find the probabilities first:

P(draw 3X and 1O from Deck A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(24,1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^2
                                              = (220) * (1/27) * (1/3) * (24) * (1/81) * (18/27)
                                              = (220 * 24) / (3^7)
                                              ≈ 0.2211

P(draw 3X and 1O from Deck B) = C(12,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(24,1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^2
                                              = (220) * (1/27) * (2/3) * (24) * (1/81) * (1/9)
                                              = (220 * 24) / (3^7) * (2/9)
                                              ≈ 0.1105

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(draw 3X and 1O from Deck A) / P(draw 3X and 1O from Deck B)
      ≈ 0.2211 / 0.1105
      ≈ 2.00

Since the odds are approximately 2, it is slightly more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X-marked cards. However, since the value is close to 1, it is not a strong indication, and additional information may be needed to make a more definitive conclusion.
