To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(3 Xs, 1 O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(52, 4)
                                 = 286 / 270,725 ≈ 0.00106

For Deck B:
P(3 Xs, 1 O | Deck B) = C(17, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(52, 4)
                                 = 392 / 270,725 ≈ 0.00141

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 Xs, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 Xs, 1 O)
      = P(3 Xs, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 Xs, 1 O | Deck B)
      = 0.00106 / 0.00141 ≈ 0.75

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is approximately 0.75:1 compared to Deck B. This suggests a slightly higher probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
