To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that we've drawn 4 cards. Then, we can use these probabilities to calculate the odds.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from A)

Since we've drawn 3 X's and 1 O, the probability of drawing from Deck A given this specific draw is:
P(A|3X_1O) = [P(A) * P(3X_1O|A)] / [P(A) * P(3X_1O|A) + P(B) * P(3X_1O|B)]

We can calculate P(3X_1O|A) as follows:
P(3X_1O|A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3) = 0.147

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

The probability of drawing from Deck B given this specific draw is:
P(B|3X_1O) = [P(B) * P(3X_1O|B)] / [P(A) * P(3X_1O|A) + P(B) * P(3X_1O|B)]

We can calculate P(3X_1O|B) as follows:
P(3X_1O|B) = C(12,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1 - (1/3)^3) = 0.222

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|3X_1O) / P(B|3X_1O) = (0.147) / (0.222) â‰ˆ 0.661

The odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 0.661 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O. This means that it is slightly more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B. However, the difference is not significant, as the odds are less than 1.
