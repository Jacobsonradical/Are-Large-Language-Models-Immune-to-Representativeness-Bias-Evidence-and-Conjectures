To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck, then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A as P(3X|A) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B as P(3X|B).

First, let's find P(3X|A):

P(3X|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / C(24, 4) = 0.0064

Now, let's find P(3X|B):

P(3X|B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / C(36, 4) = 0.0156

Now, we assume that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, so the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B are equal, and the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck:

likelihood ratio = P(3X|A) / P(3X|B) = 0.0064 / 0.0156 â‰ˆ 0.4

Finally, the posterior odds are the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds, which are assumed to be 1 for equal probability:

{odds: 0.4}

So, the posterior odds suggest that the 4 cards were drawn more likely from Deck B, where most cards are marked O. However, the difference is not very significant, and the actual probabilities might depend on other factors or assumptions.
