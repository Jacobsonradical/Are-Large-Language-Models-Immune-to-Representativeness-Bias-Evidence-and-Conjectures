To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and then update it with the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards.

Prior odds (Deck A / Deck B) = (Probability of Deck A) / (Probability of Deck B)
= (2/3) / (1/3)
= 2

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck and update the prior odds with these probabilities.

If 4 cards are drawn from Deck A, the probability of having 3 X and 1 O is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

If 4 cards are drawn from Deck B, the probability of having 3 X and 1 O is given by:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the updated or posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the ratio of the probabilities:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B))
= 2 * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1))
= 2 * (8/8)
= 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2:1. However, since the prior odds were already 2:1, the new information did not change the odds. This means that the initial belief that Deck A was more likely than Deck B remains unchanged after drawing 4 cards.
