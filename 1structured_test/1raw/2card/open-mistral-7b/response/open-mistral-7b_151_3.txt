To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

In Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (C(13, 3) / C(52, 4))

In Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (C(18, 3) / C(52, 4))

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B))

P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck B) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B))

After calculating the probabilities and the posterior odds, we get:

{odds: 2.35}

This means that given the observed data (drawing 3X and 1O cards), the probability of the cards having been drawn from Deck A is about 2.35 times higher than the probability of them having been drawn from Deck B.
