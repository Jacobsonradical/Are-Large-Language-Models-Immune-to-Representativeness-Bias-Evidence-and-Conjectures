To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then divide these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O). The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a single card marked O is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a sequence is (2/3) \* (1/3) \* (2/3) \* (1/3) \* (2/3) = 8/243.

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O). The probability of drawing a single card marked X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing a single card marked O is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a sequence is (1/3) \* (2/3) \* (1/3) \* (2/3) \* (1/3) = 1/243.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)} = (8/243) / (1/243) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8 to 1.
