To find the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A over Deck B, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then compare these probabilities.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(4X|A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = (8/273)

P(A) = (1/2)

For Deck B:
P(4X|B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = (2/243)

P(B) = (1/2)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A|4X) / P(B|4X)

First, let's find P(A|4X) and P(B|4X):

P(A|4X) = P(4X|A) * P(A) / P(4X)
P(B|4X) = P(4X|B) * P(B) / P(4X)

Since the decks have the same number of cards and each draw is independent, P(4X) is the same for both decks: P(4X) = (1/2^4) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/1680)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = [(8/273) * (1/2)] / [(2/243) * (1/2)]

Posterior Odds â‰ˆ 0.647

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is approximately 0.647 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
