To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide that by the prior odds.

First, let's find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(16, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^4)
   where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time

2. Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^4)

Now, let's assume the prior odds of drawing from Deck A are P(A) and from Deck B are P(B), and P(A) + P(B) = 1.

The posterior odds are then:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(B)]

However, without knowing the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we cannot provide a numerical answer for the posterior odds.
