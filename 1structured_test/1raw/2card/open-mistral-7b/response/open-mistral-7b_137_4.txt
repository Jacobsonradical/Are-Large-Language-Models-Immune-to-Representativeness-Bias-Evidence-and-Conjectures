To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's calculate the likelihood first:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1 - (2/3)^3)
   where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

2. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1 - (1/3)^3)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = [P(Deck A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)]

= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

Since we're given that Deck A has 2/3 X and 1/3 O, and Deck B has 1/3 X and 2/3 O, we can calculate P(Deck A) and P(Deck B):

P(Deck A) = 1/2
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)}

You can calculate the specific value of the odds using the probabilities and combinations calculated above.
