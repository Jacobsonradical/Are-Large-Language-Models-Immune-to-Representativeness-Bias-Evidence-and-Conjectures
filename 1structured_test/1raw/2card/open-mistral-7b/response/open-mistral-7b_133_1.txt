To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 / 27

Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 84 / 27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
                      = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                      = (220/27) / (84/27)
                      = 55 / 21

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 55 to 21. In decimal form, this is approximately 2.62:1.
