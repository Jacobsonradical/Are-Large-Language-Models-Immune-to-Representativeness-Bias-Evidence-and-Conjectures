To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 + C(12, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) + C(12, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^2

Where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

And the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(18, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 + C(18, 2) * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) + C(18, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

odds = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]

However, the problem does not provide information about the total number of cards in each deck. Without this information, we cannot calculate the probabilities of drawing 4 cards from each deck and thus cannot find the posterior odds. Please provide the total number of cards in each deck for a numerical answer.
