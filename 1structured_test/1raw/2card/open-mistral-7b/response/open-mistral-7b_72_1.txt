To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, and 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = 4/27

Now, we can find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B:

P(A) = P(drawing from Deck A) = 1/2
P(B) = P(drawing from Deck B) = 1/2

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the observation given Deck A and Deck B:

L = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 4/27 = 2/3

The posterior odds are the likelihood ratio times the prior probabilities:

odds = L * P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) * (1/2) / (1/2) = 2/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2/3.
