To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

For Deck A:
P(X|Deck A) = Number of X cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
             = 2/3

P(O|Deck A) = Number of O cards in Deck A / Total number of cards in Deck A
             = 1/3

P(3X, 1O|Deck A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
                     = 36 * 1 * (1/27)
                     = 12/27
                     = 4/9

For Deck B:
P(X|Deck B) = Number of X cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
             = 1/3

P(O|Deck B) = Number of O cards in Deck B / Total number of cards in Deck B
             = 2/3

P(3X, 1O|Deck B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
                     = 84 * 1 * (1/243)
                     = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(Deck A|3X, 1O) / P(Deck B|3X, 1O)
                = (P(3X, 1O|Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O|Deck B) * P(Deck B))
                = (4/9 * 1) / (1/27 * 1/3)
                = 4 / (1 / 27)
                = 108

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 108 to 1 compared to the odds that they were drawn from Deck B. This means that it is much more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
