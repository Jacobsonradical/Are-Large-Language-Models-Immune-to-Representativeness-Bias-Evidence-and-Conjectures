To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A over Deck B given the observed data.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X|DeckA) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
              = 220 * (1/27) * (1/3)
              = 220 * (1/81)
              = 26/81

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X|DeckB) = C(18,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
              = 153 * (1/27) * (2/3)
              = 153 * (2/81)
              = 104/81

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X|DeckA) / P(3X|DeckB) = (26/81) / (104/81) = 26/104 = 1/4

Since the prior odds of Deck A over Deck B is 2 (since there are twice as many X's in Deck A), the posterior odds are:

{odds: 2 * LR = 2 * (1/4) = 1/2}

So, given the observed data, the posterior odds favor Deck B, the deck with more O's, over Deck A, the deck with more X's.
