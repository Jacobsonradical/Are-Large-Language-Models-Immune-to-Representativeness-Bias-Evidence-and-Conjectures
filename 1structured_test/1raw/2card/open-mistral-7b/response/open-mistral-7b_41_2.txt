To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the priors (probability of each deck before drawing cards) and the likelihood (probability of drawing 3X and 1O given each deck).

Prior odds (A : B) = P(A) / P(B)

Let's calculate P(A) and P(B):

P(A) = (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^4 = (1/81) * (1/81) = 1/6561
P(B) = (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^4 = (1/81) * (32/81) = 1/243

So, P(A) / P(B) = 1/243 / (1/243 * 32/81) = 1/32

Now let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O:

P(3X and 1O | A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/243
P(3X and 1O | B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/243

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood of 3X and 1O given A / Likelihood of 3X and 1O given B * Prior odds

Posterior odds = (32/243) / (8/243) * (1/32) = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2.
