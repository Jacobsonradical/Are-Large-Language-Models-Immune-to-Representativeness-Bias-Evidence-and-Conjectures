To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X,1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X,1O).

The prior probability of Deck A being selected is P(A) = 1/2, and the prior probability of Deck B being selected is P(B) = 1/2.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O|A) = C(12,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X,1O|B) = C(18,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

After calculating these probabilities, we can find the posterior odds:
odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Please note that you may need to use a calculator or software to compute the binomial coefficients (C(n,k)) and perform the necessary calculations.
