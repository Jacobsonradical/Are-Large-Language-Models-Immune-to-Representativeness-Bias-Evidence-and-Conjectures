To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(26, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(26-1)
                                           ≈ 0.0178

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B) = C(19, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(27, 1) * (2/3)^1 * (1/3)^(27-1)
                                           ≈ 0.0201

The posterior odds are then given by the ratio of these two probabilities:

{odds: 0.0178 / 0.0201 ≈ 0.885}

So, the posterior odds are approximately 0.885 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This means that Deck A is slightly more likely to be the source of the 4 cards than Deck B, but there is still some uncertainty as the odds are less than 1.
