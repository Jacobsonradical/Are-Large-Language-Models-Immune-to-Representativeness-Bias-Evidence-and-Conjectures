To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O cards from each deck and then divide them.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
                                 = (2! / 3!) * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3))
                                 = (2 * 1) * (1/27)
                                 = 2/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3X and 1O cards from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
                                 = (1! / 3!) * ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
                                 = (1 * 2/27)
                                 = 2/27

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                           = (2/27) / (2/27)
                           = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the prior odds do not change after observing the 4 cards. Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are still the same as the prior odds:

{odds: 1}
