To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                             = 66 * (1/27) * (1/3)
                             = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(10, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                             = 120 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                             = 4/3

Now, let's denote the prior probability of Deck A as P(A) and the prior probability of Deck B as P(B) = 1 - P(A).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of Deck A is:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(B)]

The posterior probability of Deck B is:

P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(B)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(B)]

Now, the posterior odds are:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

Using the given values, we can calculate both probabilities and the odds:

odds = [(2/3) * P(A)] / [(4/3) * P(B)]

Unfortunately, without knowing the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we cannot provide the exact numerical value for the odds. However, we can determine that the odds favor Deck A because the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is smaller than that from Deck B, but the number of X's in Deck A is higher.
