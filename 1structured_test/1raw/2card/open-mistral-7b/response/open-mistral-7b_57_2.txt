To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide these probabilities.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing 3 X's is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 1/21
The probability of drawing 1 O is (1/3)C1 * (2/3) = 2/9
So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (1/21) * (2/9) = 2/162

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing 3 X's is (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 1/21
The probability of drawing 1 O is (2/3)C1 * (1/3) = 2/9
So the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/21) * (2/9) = 2/162

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A / Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
                          = (2/162) / (2/162)
                          = 1

Since the probabilities are equal, the posterior odds are 1, which means there's no preference between Deck A and Deck B based on the given information. However, it's important to note that this does not mean that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to have been drawn; the probability of drawing Deck A or Deck B is still determined by the sample space of all possible decks, which is not given in this problem.
