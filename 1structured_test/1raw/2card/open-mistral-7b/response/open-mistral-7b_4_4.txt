To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, then compare these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|4X1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|4X1O).

For Deck A:
P(3X1O|A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/243

P(A) = (2/3)

So, P(A|4X1O) = P(4X1O|A) * P(A) / P(4X1O)
                   = (8/243) * (2/3) / [P(4X1O)]

For Deck B:
P(3X1O|B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

P(B) = (1/3)

So, P(B|4X1O) = P(4X1O|B) * P(B) / P(4X1O)
                   = (2/81) * (1/3) / [P(4X1O)]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|4X1O) / P(B|4X1O)
      = [(8/243) * (2/3) / (2/81)] / [(2/81) * (1/3) / (2/81)]
      = 8/2 * 3/2 / 2/1
      = 24:4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 24 to 4, favoring Deck A.
