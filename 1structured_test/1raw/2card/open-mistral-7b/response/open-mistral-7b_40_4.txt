To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(A|3X, 1O), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(B|3X, 1O).

First, let's calculate P(A|3X, 1O). Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is the probability of drawing 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O from 1/3 of the deck:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1)) / C(1, 4)

Here, C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (66/216) * (1/3) / (1/4) = 2/9

Now, let's calculate P(B|3X, 1O). Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is the probability of drawing 3 X's from 1/3 of the deck multiplied by the probability of drawing 1 O from 2/3 of the deck:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1)) / C(1, 4)

Again, calculating this, we get:

P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/84) * (2/3) / (1/4) = 1/8

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing P(A|3X, 1O) by P(B|3X, 1O):

{odds: 2/1}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2 to 1.
