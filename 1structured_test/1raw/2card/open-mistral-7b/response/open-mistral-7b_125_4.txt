To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability of drawing from Deck A
- P(B) as the probability of drawing from Deck B
- P(X|A) as the probability of drawing an X given Deck A
- P(X|B) as the probability of drawing an X given Deck B

Given that 3 cards are X's and 1 card is O, the probability of drawing from Deck A is:
P(A|X_3O_1) = [P(X_3O_1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(X_3O_1|A) \* P(A) + P(X_3O_1|B) \* P(B)]

Where P(X_3O_1|A) and P(X_3O_1|B) are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, respectively.

- P(X_3O_1|A) can be calculated as (2/3)C3 \* (1/3)C1 = 8/27
- P(X_3O_1|B) can be calculated as (1/3)C3 \* (2/3)C1 = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the probability of drawing from Deck B:
P(B|X_3O_1) = [P(X_3O_1|B) \* P(B)] / [P(X_3O_1|A) \* P(A) + P(X_3O_1|B) \* P(B)]

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we can divide the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:

odds = P(A|X_3O_1) / P(B|X_3O_1)

Using the calculated probabilities, we get:

odds = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

So, given the observed event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, is 4 times higher than the odds that the cards were drawn from Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
