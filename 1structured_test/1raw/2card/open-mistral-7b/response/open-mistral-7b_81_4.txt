To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let P(A) be the probability of drawing from Deck A and P(B) be the probability of drawing from Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination of choosing 3 X's from 2/3 of the deck (denoted by C(2/3, 3)) and 1 O from 1/3 of the deck (denoted by C(1/3, 1)):

P(A|3X, 1O) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

Similarly, for Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(B|3X, 1O) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by taking the ratio of P(A|3X, 1O) and P(B|3X, 1O):

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

After calculating the probabilities and taking the ratio, the answer is approximately:

{odds: 1.09}

This means that, given the observed data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the probability of the event occurring in Deck A is slightly more likely than in Deck B. However, the difference is not substantial, as the odds are nearly 1, indicating that the data does not significantly favor one deck over the other.
