To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them.

Let's denote the number of X's and O's drawn from Deck A as X_A and O_A respectively, and from Deck B as X_B and O_B.

From Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability:

P(X_A=3, O_A=1 | Deck A) = C(n=4, k=3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                          = 4 * (2/27) * (1/3)
                                          = 8/27

From Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial probability:

P(X_B=3, O_B=1 | Deck B) = C(n=4, k=3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                          = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
                                          = 8/27

Since the decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1. Now, we calculate the posterior odds as:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
        = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)
        = (8/27) / (8/27) * 1 / 1
        = 1

So the posterior odds are 1, meaning there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other based on the given information.
