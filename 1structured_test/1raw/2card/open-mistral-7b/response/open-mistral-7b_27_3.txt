To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratios and then multiply them by the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the prior odds:
P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(10, 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3) = 120 * (1/27) = 4/9

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(15, 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3) = 455 * (1/27) = 16/9

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 4/9 / 16/9 = 1/4

Finally, multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds:
Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds = (1/4) * 2 = 1/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/2. This means there is a 50% chance that the deck drawn was Deck A and a 50% chance that it was Deck B.
