To find the posterior odds, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent Deck A and B represent Deck B. We're given the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A
P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B

P(X|A) = Probability of drawing a card marked X given that it's from Deck A = 2/3
P(X|B) = Probability of drawing a card marked X given that it's from Deck B = 1/3

P(O|A) = Probability of drawing a card marked O given that it's from Deck A = 1/3
P(O|B) = Probability of drawing a card marked O given that it's from Deck B = 2/3

Given that 4 cards were drawn with 3 X's and 1 O, the likelihood of drawing from Deck A is:

L(A|4X1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 1/27

The likelihood of drawing from Deck B is:

L(B|4X1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|4X1O) / P(B|4X1O) = (1/27) / (2/27) = 1/2

So the posterior odds are 1 to 2 in favor of Deck B over Deck A, given the observed 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O. This means that, based on the observed data, Deck B is slightly more likely to have been the source of the drawn cards than Deck A.
