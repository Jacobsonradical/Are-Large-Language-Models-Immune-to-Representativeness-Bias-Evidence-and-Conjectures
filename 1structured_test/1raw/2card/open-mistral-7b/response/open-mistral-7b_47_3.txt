To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, and then the likelihoods of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards given each deck.

Prior probabilities:
P(Deck A) = 1/2 (since the deck was chosen at random)
P(Deck B) = 1/2

Likelihoods:
L(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(13, 3) / C(52, 4) (where C is the number of combinations)
L(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(16, 3) / C(52, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = L(3X, 1O | Deck A) / L(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Calculating the values and simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)) * (C(16, 3) / C(13, 3)) * (C(52, 4) / C(52, 4))

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (16! / (13! * 3!)) * (52! / (48! * 4!))

Posterior odds â‰ˆ 1.53

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with most cards marked X, are approximately 1.53 times higher than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B, the deck with most cards marked O.
