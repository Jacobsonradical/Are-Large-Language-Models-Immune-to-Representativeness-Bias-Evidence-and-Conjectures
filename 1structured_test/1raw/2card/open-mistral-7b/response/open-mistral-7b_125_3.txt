To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the ratio of the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = P(3X | Deck A) * P(1O | Deck A)
                                 = C(2/3 * 27, 3) * C(1/3 * 27, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(27-3) * (1/3) * (2/3)^(27-1)
                                 = (27! / (3! * 24!)) * (27! / (1! * 26!)) * (1/27)^7 * (2/27)^(26) * (1/27) * (2/27)^(26)
                                 = (27! / (3! * 24!)) * (27! / (1! * 26!)) * (1/27^7) * (2/27)^(52)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = P(3X | Deck B) * P(1O | Deck B)
                                 = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(52-3) * (1/3) * (2/3)^(52-1)
                                 = (52! / (3! * 49!)) * (52! / (1! * 48!)) * (1/52)^7 * (2/52)^(48) * (1/52) * (2/52)^(48)
                                 = (52! / (3! * 49!)) * (52! / (1! * 48!)) * (1/52^7) * (2/52)^(96)

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                                                         = (27! / (3! * 24!)) * (27! / (1! * 26!)) * (1/27^7) * (2/27)^(52) /
                                                         (52! / (3! * 49!)) * (52! / (1! * 48!)) * (1/52^7) * (2/52)^(96)
                                                         = (27 * 27!) / (3! * 24! * 52! * 49!) * (2/27)^(52 - 7) * (2/52)^(96)
                                                         = (27 * 27!) / (3! * 24! * 52! * 49!) * (2/27)^45 * (2/52)^(96)
                                                         â‰ˆ 0.096

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 0.096. This means that, given the observed 4 cards, Deck A is about 9.6 times more likely than Deck B.
