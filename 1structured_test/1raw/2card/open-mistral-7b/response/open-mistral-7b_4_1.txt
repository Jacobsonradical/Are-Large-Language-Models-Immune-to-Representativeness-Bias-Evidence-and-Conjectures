To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A as P(3X,1O|A) and the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B as P(3X,1O|B).

First, let's find P(3X,1O|A):
- The probability of drawing 3X from Deck A is (2/3) * (1 - (2/3))^3 = 1/4
- The probability of drawing 1O from Deck A is (1/3)
- So, P(3X,1O|A) = (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/12

Next, let's find P(3X,1O|B):
- The probability of drawing 3X from Deck B is (1/3) * (2/3)^3 = 1/8
- The probability of drawing 1O from Deck B is (2/3)
- So, P(3X,1O|B) = (1/8) * (2/3) = 1/12

Now, we know that the prior odds are equal to the ratio of probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B:
P(A) / P(B) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Finally, we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

odds = [P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since P(3X,1O|A) = P(3X,1O|B), the odds are equal to the prior odds:

{odds: 2}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2 times higher than the odds of drawing them from Deck B.
