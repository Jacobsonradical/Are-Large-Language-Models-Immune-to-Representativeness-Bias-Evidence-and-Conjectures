To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, and then divide those probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
                                     = 220 * (8/27) * (1/3)
                                     = 220/27

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = C(24, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                                     = 4620 * (1/27) * (2/9)
                                     = 4620/243

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's, 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's, 1 O)
      = P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B)
      = (220/27) / (4620/243)
      = 220 * 243 / (27 * 4620)
      = 220 / 4620
      = 11/232

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 11/232.
