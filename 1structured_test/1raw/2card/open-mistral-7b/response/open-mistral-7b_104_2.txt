To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide these probabilities.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(7, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(26, 1) * (1/3)^1 * (2/3)^(26-1)
                                  = (35) * (1/27) * (1) * (26/6561) * (49/6561)
                                  = 35 * (1/27) * (26/6561)

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(20-1) * C(40, 1) * (2/3) * (1/3)^(40-1)
                                  = (1140) * (1/27)^3 * (1/81) * (40) * (1/3)^1 * (29/81)^(39)
                                  = 1140 * (1/27)^3 * (40/81) * (29/81)

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing these probabilities:

{odds: P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)} = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B)]
                                                        = [35 * (1/27) * (26/6561)] / [1140 * (1/27)^3 * (40/81)]
                                                        ≈ 0.0062 / 0.0075
                                                        ≈ 0.83 : 1

So, given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn, the posterior odds are approximately 0.83 to 1 in favor of the cards coming from Deck A, which has more X-marked cards.
