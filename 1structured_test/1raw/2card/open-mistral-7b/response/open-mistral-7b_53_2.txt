To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, and then divide this ratio by the prior odds (which is 1 in this case, as we started with no information about which deck was drawn).

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck where 2/3 of the cards are marked X is (2/3)C3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

2. Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a deck where 1/3 of the cards are marked X is (1/3)C3 * (2/3) = 4/27.

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of Deck A) / (Likelihood of Deck B) = (8/81) / (4/27) = 2 / 3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 2:3. This means that for every 2 times you believe the cards were drawn from Deck A, you should believe once that they were drawn from Deck B.
