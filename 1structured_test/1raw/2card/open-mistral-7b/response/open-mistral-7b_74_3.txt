To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio of Deck A to Deck B given the observed data.

Let's first calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:

1. Deck A:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1 = (2*1*1)/(3*3) * (1/3) = 2/27

2. Deck B:
   P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1 = (1*1*1)/(3*3) * (2/3) = 2/27

Since the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from both decks are the same, the likelihood ratio is 1. This means there is no evidence to favor one deck over the other given the observed data.

The posterior odds cannot be calculated without any prior odds. Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: cannot be determined with the given information}
