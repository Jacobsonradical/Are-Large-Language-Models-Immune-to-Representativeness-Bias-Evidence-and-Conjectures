To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that these specific cards were drawn.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(36, 1) * (1/3)^1
                    = (220) * (1/27) * (1) * (36) * (1/3)
                    = 220 * 12
                    = 2640

Next, let's find the probability of drawing 3X's and 1O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(40, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(20, 1) * (2/3)^1
                    = (1140) * (1/27) * (1/2) * (20) * (2/3)
                    = 1140 * (1/27) * (1/2) * (66)
                    = 1140 * (1/162) * (11)
                    = 1588

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
     = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
     = 2640 / 1588
     â‰ˆ 1.6667

So, the posterior odds are approximately 1.67:1 in favor of Deck A being the one from which the cards were drawn.
