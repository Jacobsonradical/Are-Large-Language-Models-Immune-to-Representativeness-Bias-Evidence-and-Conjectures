To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that we know there are more X's in Deck A and more O's in Deck B.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing a specific number of X's and O's from each deck when drawing 4 cards.

For Deck A:
- P(X) = 2/3
- P(O) = 1/3
- P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 220 / 27

For Deck B:
- P(X) = 1/3
- P(O) = 2/3
- P(3X, 1O) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 120 / 27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

{odds: 220 / 120 = 11/6}

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, are 11 to 6 compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
