To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then divide the probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as A, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as B.

For Deck A:
A = (2/3)C3 * (1/3)C1
  = (2!/3!) * (1!/3!) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
  = (2/3)^4

For Deck B:
B = (1/3)C3 * (2/3)C1
  = (1!/3!) * (2!/3!) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
  = (2/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = A / B
               = (2/3)^4 / ((2/3)^3 * (2/3))
               = (2/3)^4 / (2/3)^4
               = 1

Since A and B have the same probability, the odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A or Deck B are equal.
