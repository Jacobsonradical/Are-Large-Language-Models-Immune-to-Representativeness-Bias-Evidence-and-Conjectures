To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.
E: The observed event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to find the odds of A given E, compared to B given E, which is given by:

Odds(A | E) / Odds(B | E) = [P(A | E) / P(B | E)] × [P(B) / P(A)]

Since the decks were selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate P(A | E) and P(B | E), we use Bayes' theorem:
P(A | E) = [P(E | A) × P(A)] / P(E)
P(B | E) = [P(E | B) × P(B)] / P(E)

P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Substituting these values, we get:
P(A | E) = [0.296 × 0.5] / P(E) = 0.148 / P(E)
P(B | E) = [0.074 × 0.5] / P(E) = 0.037 / P(E)

The odds ratio is given by:
Odds(A | E) / Odds(B | E) = [P(A | E) / P(B | E)] × [P(B) / P(A)]
                           = [0.148 / P(E)] / [0.037 / P(E)] × 1
                           = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
