To solve this problem, we need to calculate the conditional probability of obtaining the given outcome (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) for each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (4 choose 3) = 0.0370

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B) = (0.2963) / (0.0370) = 8

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
