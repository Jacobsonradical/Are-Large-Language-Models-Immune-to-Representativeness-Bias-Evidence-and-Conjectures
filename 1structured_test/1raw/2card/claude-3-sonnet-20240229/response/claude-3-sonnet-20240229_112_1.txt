To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting the observed outcome (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 were marked X, and 1 was marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.0741 = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
