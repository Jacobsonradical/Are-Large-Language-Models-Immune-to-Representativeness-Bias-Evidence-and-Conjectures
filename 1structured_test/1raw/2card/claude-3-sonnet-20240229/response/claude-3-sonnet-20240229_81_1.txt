To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
X3O1: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to find P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1), which represents the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X3O1) = [P(X3O1|A) * P(A)] / P(X3O1)
P(B|X3O1) = [P(X3O1|B) * P(B)] / P(X3O1)

Since we don't have information about the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(X3O1|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148
P(X3O1|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0370

Substituting these values into the posterior odds ratio:
P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1) = [(0.148 * 0.5) / P(X3O1)] / [(0.0370 * 0.5) / P(X3O1)]
                      = (0.074 / P(X3O1)) / (0.0185 / P(X3O1))
                      = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
