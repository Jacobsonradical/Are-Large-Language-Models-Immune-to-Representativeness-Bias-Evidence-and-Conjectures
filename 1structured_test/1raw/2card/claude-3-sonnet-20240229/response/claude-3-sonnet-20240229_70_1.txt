To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- Observed data: 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Let's denote the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck A as P(D|A) and the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck B as P(D|B).

Step 1: Calculate P(D|A).
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate P(D|B).
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (8/9) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B.
Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 243/81 = 3

Posterior odds = 1 × 3 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3:1.

{odds: 3}
