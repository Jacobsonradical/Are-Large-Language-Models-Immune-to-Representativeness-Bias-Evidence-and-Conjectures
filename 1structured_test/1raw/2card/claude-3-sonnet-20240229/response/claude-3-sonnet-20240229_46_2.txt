To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed set of cards from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing the observed set of cards from Deck B as P(B|data).

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is:
P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is:
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is the ratio of these probabilities:
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
