To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take their ratio.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (Combination of 4 cards from Deck A) = (8/27) * (6/4) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (Combination of 4 cards from Deck B) = (1/27) * (6/4) = 1/18

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so the prior odds ratio is 1.

The posterior odds are calculated as:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
            = 1 * (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B))
            = 1 * (8/27) / (1/18)
            = 8 * 18 / 27
            = 48/27
            = 16/9

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 16/9}
