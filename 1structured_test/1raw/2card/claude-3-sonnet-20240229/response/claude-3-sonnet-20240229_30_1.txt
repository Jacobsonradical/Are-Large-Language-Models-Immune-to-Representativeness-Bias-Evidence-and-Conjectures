To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck A)
P(E | Deck A) = (8/27) × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × 4 = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck B)
P(E | Deck B) = (1/27) × (4 choose 1) = (1/27) × 4 = 4/81

The posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:
Posterior odds = (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) = (32/81) / (4/81) = 8

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 8}
