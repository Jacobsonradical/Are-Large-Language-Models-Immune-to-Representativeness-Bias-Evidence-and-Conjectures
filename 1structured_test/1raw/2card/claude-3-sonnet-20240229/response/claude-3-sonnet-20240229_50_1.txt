To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of getting the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) for each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- Observed data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of getting the observed data for Deck A.
Likelihood of getting 3 cards marked X = (2/3)^3 = 0.296
Likelihood of getting 1 card marked O = (1/3)^1 = 0.333
Likelihood of getting the observed data for Deck A = 0.296 × 0.333 = 0.0986

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of getting the observed data for Deck B.
Likelihood of getting 3 cards marked X = (1/3)^3 = 0.037
Likelihood of getting 1 card marked O = (2/3)^1 = 0.667
Likelihood of getting the observed data for Deck B = 0.037 × 0.667 = 0.0247

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood for Deck A) / (Prior odds × Likelihood for Deck B + Likelihood for Deck A)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected, we can assume equal prior odds of 1.

Posterior odds = (1 × 0.0986) / (1 × 0.0247 + 0.0986) = 0.8

{odds: 0.8}
