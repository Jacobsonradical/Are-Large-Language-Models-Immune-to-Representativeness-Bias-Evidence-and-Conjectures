To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

The posterior odds of Deck A given E is:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since one of the decks is selected by chance)
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0185 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting the values in the equation:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (0.148 * 1/2) / (0.0185 * 1/2) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8:1.

{odds: 8}
