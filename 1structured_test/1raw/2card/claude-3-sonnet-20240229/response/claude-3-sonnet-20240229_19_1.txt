To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem and calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the posterior odds).

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior probabilities of A and B given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

We know that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the decks were chosen at random).

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (0.296 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.8
P(B|D) = (0.0741 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.2

The posterior odds of A compared to B are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
