To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the events:
A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
E: 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior probabilities of A and B given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

Since we don't know P(E), we can calculate the ratio directly:
(P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X, and 1/3 are O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X, and 2/3 are O.
- We assume both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4, 3) = 0.296
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4, 3) = 0.074

Substituting the values:
(P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                  = (0.296 * 0.5) / (0.074 * 0.5)
                  = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
