To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X = (2/3)^3
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × (4 choose 3) = 16/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X = (1/3)^3
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × (4 choose 3) = 8/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (16/81) / (8/81) = 2

Posterior odds = 1 × 2 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 2:1.

{odds: 2}
