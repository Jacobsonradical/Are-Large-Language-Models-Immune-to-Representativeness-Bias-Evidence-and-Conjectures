To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, and 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, and 2/3 cards are marked O.
- We draw 4 cards, and the outcome is 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 2/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 1/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be selected initially)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.074 = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
