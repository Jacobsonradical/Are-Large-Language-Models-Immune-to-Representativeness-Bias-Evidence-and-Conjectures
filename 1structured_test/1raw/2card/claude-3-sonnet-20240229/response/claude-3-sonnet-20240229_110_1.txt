To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining the observed outcome (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The observed outcome of 3 X's and 1 O

We need to find P(A|E) and P(B|E), which are the posterior probabilities of each deck given the observed outcome.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (equal prior probabilities)

We can calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability distribution:
P(E|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(E|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.2963 * 1/2 + 0.0741 * 1/2) = 0.8
P(B|E) = (0.0741 * 1/2) / (0.2963 * 1/2 + 0.0741 * 1/2) = 0.2

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
