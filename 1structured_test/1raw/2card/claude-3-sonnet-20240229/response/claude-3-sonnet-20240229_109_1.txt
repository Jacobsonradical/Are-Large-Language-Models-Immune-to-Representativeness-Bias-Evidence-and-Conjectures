To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of event E for each deck.
Likelihood of E for Deck A = P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296
Likelihood of E for Deck B = P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 2: Calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem.
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) × P(A)) / (P(E|A) × P(A) + P(E|B) × P(B))
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) × P(B)) / (P(E|A) × P(A) + P(E|B) × P(B))

Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal (0.5 each).

P(A|E) = (0.296 × 0.5) / (0.296 × 0.5 + 0.074 × 0.5) = 0.8
P(B|E) = (0.074 × 0.5) / (0.296 × 0.5 + 0.074 × 0.5) = 0.2

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
