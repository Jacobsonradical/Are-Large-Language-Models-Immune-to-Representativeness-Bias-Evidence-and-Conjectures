To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
E: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to find P(A|E) and P(B|E), and then calculate the posterior odds as P(A|E) / P(B|E).

From the given information, we know:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was selected by chance)
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.148

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
       = (0.296 * 0.5) / (0.296 * 0.5 + 0.148 * 0.5)
       = 0.667

P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
       = (0.148 * 0.5) / (0.296 * 0.5 + 0.148 * 0.5)
       = 0.333

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.667 / 0.333 = 2

{odds: 2}
