To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
X: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), which represents the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A)
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.074 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probability of selecting either deck)

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = 0.296 * 0.5 + 0.074 * 0.5 = 0.185

Substituting the values:
P(A|X) = (0.296 * 0.5) / 0.185 = 0.8
P(B|X) = (0.074 * 0.5) / 0.185 = 0.2

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

{odds: 4}
