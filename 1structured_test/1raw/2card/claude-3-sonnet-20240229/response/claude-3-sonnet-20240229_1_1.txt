To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 were marked X, and 1 was marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from deck A = 1/3
Probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from deck B = 2/3
Probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting deck A or deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from deck A) / (Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.148 = 2

Posterior odds = 1 × 2 = 2

{odds: 2}
