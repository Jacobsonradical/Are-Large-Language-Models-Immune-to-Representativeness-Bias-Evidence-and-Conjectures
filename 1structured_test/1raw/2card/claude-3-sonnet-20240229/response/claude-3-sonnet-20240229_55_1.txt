To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The observed event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find the posterior odds of A versus B, given the observed event E.

Posterior odds = (P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B), we need to use the binomial probability distribution formula:
P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.148

Substituting the values in the posterior odds formula:
Posterior odds = (P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B)) = (0.296 * 1/2) / (0.148 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 2}
