To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting the observed outcome (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (4 choose 3) = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/81) * (4 choose 3) = 32/243

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1 since both decks were equally likely to be chosen.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A relative to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = (P(E|A) / P(E|B)) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = ((32/81) / (32/243)) * 1
Posterior odds = 81/27 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 3}
