To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities to obtain the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the probabilities as follows:
P(A) = Probability of selecting deck A
P(B) = Probability of selecting deck B
P(X|A) = Probability of drawing a card marked X from deck A = 2/3
P(O|A) = Probability of drawing a card marked O from deck A = 1/3
P(X|B) = Probability of drawing a card marked X from deck B = 1/3
P(O|B) = Probability of drawing a card marked O from deck B = 2/3

The posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A is:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(A) × P(X|A)^3 × P(O|A)) / (P(A) × P(X|A)^3 × P(O|A) + P(B) × P(X|B)^3 × P(O|B))

The posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B is:
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(B) × P(X|B)^3 × P(O|B)) / (P(A) × P(X|A)^3 × P(O|A) + P(B) × P(X|B)^3 × P(O|B))

Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|3X, 1O) = (0.5 × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)) / (0.5 × (2/3)^3 × (1/3) + 0.5 × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)) ≈ 0.8889
P(B|3X, 1O) = (0.5 × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)) / (0.5 × (2/3)^3 × (1/3) + 0.5 × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)) ≈ 0.1111

The posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from deck A compared to deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) ≈ 0.8889 / 0.1111 ≈ 8

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
