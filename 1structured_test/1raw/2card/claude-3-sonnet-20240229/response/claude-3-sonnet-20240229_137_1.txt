To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B as B.

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming both decks are equally likely to be selected initially)
- P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A)
- P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)) = (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))
             = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.0741 * 1/2)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4 to 1.
