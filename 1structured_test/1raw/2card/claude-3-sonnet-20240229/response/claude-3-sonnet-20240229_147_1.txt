To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 4 cards, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0370

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)]
= (0.148 / 0.0370)
= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
