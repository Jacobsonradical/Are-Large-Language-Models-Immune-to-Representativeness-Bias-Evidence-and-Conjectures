To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A, and the posterior probability of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B. Then, we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of these two probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, and 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, and 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing from Deck B)
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
