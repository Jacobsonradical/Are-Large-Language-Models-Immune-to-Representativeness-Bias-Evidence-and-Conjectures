To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck B as P(B|data).

P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
