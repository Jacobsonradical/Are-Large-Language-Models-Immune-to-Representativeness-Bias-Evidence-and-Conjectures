To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We have drawn 4 cards, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior odds = (P(E|A) / P(E|B)) × (P(A) / P(B))

We can assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Therefore, the posterior odds simplify to:

Posterior odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B)

To calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B), we use the binomial probability distribution:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 16/27
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 8/27

Substituting these values into the posterior odds equation, we get:

Posterior odds = (16/27) / (8/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 2}
