To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963 (probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741 (probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

Posterior odds = (P(E | A) * P(A)) / (P(E | B) * P(B))
               = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.0741 * 0.5)
               = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
