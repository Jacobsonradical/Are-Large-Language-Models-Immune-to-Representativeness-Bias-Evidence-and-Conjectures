To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on the observed data.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are assumed to be equal (1:1).
- We observed 3 X cards and 1 O card in the drawn sample.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Likelihood of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Likelihood of the observed data from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Likelihood of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Likelihood of the observed data from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood of data from Deck A) / (Likelihood of data from Deck B)
Posterior odds = (1 × (8/81)) / (2/81) = 4

{odds: 4}
