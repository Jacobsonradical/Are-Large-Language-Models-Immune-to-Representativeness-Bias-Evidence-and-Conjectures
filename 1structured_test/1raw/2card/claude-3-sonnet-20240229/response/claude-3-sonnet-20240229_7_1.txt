To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, and 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, and 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards are drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 2/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 1/3
Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 1/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 2/3
Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B.
Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Step 4: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.074 = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
