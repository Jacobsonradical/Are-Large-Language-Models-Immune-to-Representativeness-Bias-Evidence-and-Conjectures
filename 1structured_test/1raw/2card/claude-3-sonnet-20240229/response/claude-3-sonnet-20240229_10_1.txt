To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on the observed data.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Prior odds of selecting Deck A: P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected initially)

Likelihood of E given Deck A: P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
Likelihood of E given Deck B: P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
             = 1 * (P(E|A) / P(E|B))
             = 1 * (0.2963 / 0.0741)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
