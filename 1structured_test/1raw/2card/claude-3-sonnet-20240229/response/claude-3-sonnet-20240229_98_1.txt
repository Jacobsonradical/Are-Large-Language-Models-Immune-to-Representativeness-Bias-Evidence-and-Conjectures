To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining the given outcome (3 X cards and 1 O card) from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of obtaining the given outcome from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of obtaining the same outcome from Deck B as P(B).

For Deck A:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio P(A) / P(B), which is:

Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
