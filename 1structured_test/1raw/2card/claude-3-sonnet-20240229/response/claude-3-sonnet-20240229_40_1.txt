To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) given each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Since the decks were selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate P(D|A), we need to find the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A, which is:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296

Similarly, for P(D|B), we have:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.148

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|D) = (0.296 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.444 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (0.148 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.222 / P(D)

The posterior odds are then:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.444 / P(D)) / (0.222 / P(D)) = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 2}
