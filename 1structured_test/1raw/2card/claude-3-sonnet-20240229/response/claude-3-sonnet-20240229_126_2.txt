To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under the two hypotheses (Deck A and Deck B), multiplied by the prior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1 (since we don't have any prior information favoring one deck over the other)

Likelihood of E under Deck A (2/3 X cards and 1/3 O cards):
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

Likelihood of E under Deck B (1/3 X cards and 2/3 O cards):
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
               = 1 * (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B))
               = 1 * (0.2963 / 0.0741)
               = 4

{odds: 4}
