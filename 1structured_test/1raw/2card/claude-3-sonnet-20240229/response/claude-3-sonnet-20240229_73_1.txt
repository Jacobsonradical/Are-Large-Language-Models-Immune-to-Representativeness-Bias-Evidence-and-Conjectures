To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 3 X cards and 1 O card from one of the decks.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Likelihood of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Likelihood of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B (assuming equal probability).
Prior odds = 1

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood of data from Deck A) / (Likelihood of data from Deck B)
Posterior odds = (1 × (8/81)) / (2/81) = 4

{odds: 4}
