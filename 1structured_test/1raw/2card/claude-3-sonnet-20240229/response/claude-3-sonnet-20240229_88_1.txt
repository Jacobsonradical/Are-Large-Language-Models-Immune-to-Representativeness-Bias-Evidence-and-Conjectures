To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) × P(Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B) × P(Deck B))

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen (P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5), the posterior odds simplify to:
Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(3X, 1O | Deck B))
            = (0.2963) / (0.0741)
            = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
