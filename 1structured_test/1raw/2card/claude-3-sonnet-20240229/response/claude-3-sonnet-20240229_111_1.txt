To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A, given the observed data of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing the cards from Deck B as B.

The prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B are 1:1, as the problem statement mentions that one of the decks was selected by chance.

The likelihood of observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148

The likelihood of observing the same data, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0370

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B are:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
Posterior odds = 1 * (P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B))
Posterior odds = 1 * (0.148 / 0.0370)
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
