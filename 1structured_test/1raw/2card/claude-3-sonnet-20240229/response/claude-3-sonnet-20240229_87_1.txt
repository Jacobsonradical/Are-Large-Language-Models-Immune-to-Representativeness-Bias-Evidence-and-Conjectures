To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of selecting Deck A given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), and then find the odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event of selecting Deck A as A, and the event of selecting Deck B as B.

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the decks are chosen at random)

The likelihood of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) given each deck is:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B))
           = (8/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5 + 2/81 * 0.5)
           = 4/6 = 2/3

P(B|data) = (P(data|B) * P(B)) / (P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B))
           = (2/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5 + 2/81 * 0.5)
           = 1/6

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (2/3) / (1/6) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
