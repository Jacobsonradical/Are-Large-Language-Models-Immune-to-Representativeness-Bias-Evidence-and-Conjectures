To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck A)
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (8/27) × (1/3) × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck A)
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck B)
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/27) × (2/3) × (Combination of 4 cards from Deck B)
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
