To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] × [P(A) / P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck initially)
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.1481 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting the values:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [0.1481 / 0.0741] × [0.5 / 0.5]
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 2:1.
