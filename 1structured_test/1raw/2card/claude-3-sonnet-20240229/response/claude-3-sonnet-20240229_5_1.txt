To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihoods of obtaining the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihoods of obtaining the observed data from each deck.
Likelihood of obtaining 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
Likelihood of obtaining 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 2: Assume equal prior odds of selecting either deck (prior odds = 1).

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Likelihood of data given Deck A / Likelihood of data given Deck B) × Prior odds
Posterior odds = (0.2963 / 0.0741) × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:
