To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then apply Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Likelihood of E given Deck A, P(E|A):
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Likelihood of E given Deck B, P(E|B):
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B given the event E is:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
              = 1 × (P(E|A) / P(E|B))
              = 1 × (8/81) / (2/81)
              = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
