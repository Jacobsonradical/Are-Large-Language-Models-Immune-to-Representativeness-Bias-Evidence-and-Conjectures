To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given the observed evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: The evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the evidence E, which is represented as:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|E) and P(B|E):

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)
P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E)

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B), we need to use the binomial probability distribution formula:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2962
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equations:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E) = (0.2962 * 0.5) / [(0.2962 * 0.5) + (0.0741 * 0.5)] = 0.8
P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E) = (0.0741 * 0.5) / [(0.2962 * 0.5) + (0.0741 * 0.5)] = 0.2

Finally, the posterior odds of A over B, given the evidence E, is:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
