To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A given the observed evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The observed evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the evidence E:

Posterior odds = (P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- Assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

We can calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability distribution:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

Posterior odds = (P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B))
              = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.0741 * 1/2)
              = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.
