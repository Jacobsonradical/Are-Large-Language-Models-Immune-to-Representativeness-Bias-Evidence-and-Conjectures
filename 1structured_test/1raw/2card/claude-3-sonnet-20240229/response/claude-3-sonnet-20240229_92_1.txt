To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing the given data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) under each hypothesis (Deck A or Deck B), and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds to obtain the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We observed 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from the selected deck.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of observing the data under each hypothesis.
Likelihood of observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A:
P(data | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Likelihood of observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B:
P(data | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 2: Assume equal prior odds for selecting Deck A or Deck B (prior odds = 1).

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = P(data | Deck A) / P(data | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
