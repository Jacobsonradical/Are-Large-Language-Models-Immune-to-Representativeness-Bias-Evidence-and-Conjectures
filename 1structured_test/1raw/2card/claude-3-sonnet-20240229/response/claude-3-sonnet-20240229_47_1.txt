To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (4 choose 3) = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/243) * (4 choose 3) = 32/729

The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so we can ignore them in the calculation of the posterior odds.

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = (P(E | A) / P(E | B)) = (32/243) / (32/729) = 243/64

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 3.796875}
