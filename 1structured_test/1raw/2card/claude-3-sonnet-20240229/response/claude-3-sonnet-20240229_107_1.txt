To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B, given the prior probabilities of selecting each deck.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find the odds of A given D, compared to B given D, which is given by the following ratio:

Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] × [P(B) / P(A)]

Where:
- P(A|D) and P(B|D) are the likelihoods of observing the data D given A and B, respectively.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Given information:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck)

Likelihoods:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Posterior odds:
Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] × [P(B) / P(A)]
                       = [(0.296 / 0.0741) × (1/2) / (1/2)]
                       = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
