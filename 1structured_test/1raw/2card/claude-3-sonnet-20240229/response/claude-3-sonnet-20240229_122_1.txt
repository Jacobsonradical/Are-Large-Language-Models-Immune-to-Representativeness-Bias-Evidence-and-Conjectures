To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed set of cards from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing the same set from Deck B as P(B).

Step 1: Calculate P(A).
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate P(B).
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
