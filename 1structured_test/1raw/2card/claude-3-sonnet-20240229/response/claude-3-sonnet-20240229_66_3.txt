To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing the observed set of cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's define the following events:
A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which is the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate these posterior probabilities as:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

We can calculate the likelihoods P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability distribution:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|D) = (0.2963 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.8
P(B|D) = (0.0741 * 0.5) / P(D) = 0.2

The posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
