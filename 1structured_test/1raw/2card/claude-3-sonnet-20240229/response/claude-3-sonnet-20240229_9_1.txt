To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take their ratio to find the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The observed event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior probabilities of the cards being drawn from each deck given the observed event E.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

Given information:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

We can calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability distribution:
P(E|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(E|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (0.2963 * 1/2) / P(E) = 0.1481 / P(E)
P(B|E) = (0.0741 * 1/2) / P(E) = 0.0370 / P(E)

The posterior odds are given by the ratio P(A|E) / P(B|E):
Posterior odds = (0.1481 / P(E)) / (0.0370 / P(E)) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
