To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining the observed outcome (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) under each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: The observed outcome (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probability of selecting either deck)
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2963
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (0.2963 / 0.0741) * (0.5 / 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
