To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of observing the given data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) for each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior odds = (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) × (Prior odds)

Since we don't have any prior information about the decks, we can assume that the prior odds are equal to 1.

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
