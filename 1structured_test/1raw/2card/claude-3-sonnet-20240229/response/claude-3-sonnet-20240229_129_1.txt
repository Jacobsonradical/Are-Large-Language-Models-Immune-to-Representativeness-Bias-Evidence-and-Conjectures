To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of observing the given data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under each hypothesis (Deck A or Deck B), and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find the odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D:
Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] × [P(B) / P(A)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities)
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3

We can calculate the probabilities of observing the data under each hypothesis:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0369

Substituting these values into the odds ratio formula:
Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] × [P(B) / P(A)]
                       = [(0.148 / 0.0369) × (0.5 / 0.5)]
                       = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4:1.
