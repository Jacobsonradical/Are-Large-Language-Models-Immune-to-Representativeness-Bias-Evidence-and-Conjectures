To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) as E.
Let A represent the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B represent the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the odds of A given E, compared to B given E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] × [P(A) / P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since one of the decks was selected by chance)
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting these values into the equation:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [0.148 / 0.0741] × [1/2 / 1/2]
                = 2 × 1
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 2:1.
