To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 4 cards, out of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the probabilities as follows:
P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A
P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B
P(X|A) = Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A
P(X|B) = Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B

We can calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B) using the binomial probability formula:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × C(4, 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × C(4, 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

Since we don't have any prior information about the probability of selecting either deck, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior odds = [P(X|A) × P(A)] / [P(X|B) × P(B)]
               = [(32/243) × 0.5] / [(8/243) × 0.5]
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
