To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.148

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1 since we are told that one of the decks was selected by chance.

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (0.296 / 0.148) * 1 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 2}
