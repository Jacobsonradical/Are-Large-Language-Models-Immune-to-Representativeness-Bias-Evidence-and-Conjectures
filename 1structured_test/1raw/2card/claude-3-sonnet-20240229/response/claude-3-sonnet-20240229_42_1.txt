To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to find the ratio of the likelihoods of obtaining the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) from Deck A and Deck B, and then multiply it by the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal (i.e., prior odds = 1).
- Observed data: 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck A.
Likelihood of getting 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Likelihood of getting 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Combined likelihood of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck B.
Likelihood of getting 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Likelihood of getting 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Combined likelihood of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood ratio.
Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of observed data from Deck A / Likelihood of observed data from Deck B
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds.
Prior odds = 1 (since the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal)
Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds
Posterior odds = 4 × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:
