To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The observed event (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed event E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The observed event E is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We can calculate the probabilities:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148148148
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.037037037
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since we have no prior information about which deck was selected)

Substituting the values in the equation:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (0.148148148 * 0.5) / (0.037037037 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
