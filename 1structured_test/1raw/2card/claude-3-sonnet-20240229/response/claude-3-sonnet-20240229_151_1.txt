To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities (i.e., the odds).

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.074

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior Odds = [P(E | A) / P(E | B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen, we assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Posterior Odds = [P(E | A) / P(E | B)] * [0.5 / 0.5]
              = [0.296 / 0.074] * 1
              = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
