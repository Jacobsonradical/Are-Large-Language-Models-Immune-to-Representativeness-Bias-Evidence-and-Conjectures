To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the posterior odds of A versus B, given the observed data D.

Posterior odds = (P(A|D) / P(B|D)) = (P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B))

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen)

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2962962963
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0740740741

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)) = (0.2962962963 * 1/2) / (0.0740740741 * 1/2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
