To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then find the odds ratio.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(Deck A | E) = [P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A)] / [P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A) + P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B)]
             = [(8/81) × (1/2)] / [(8/81) × (1/2) + (2/81) × (1/2)]
             = 4/6 = 2/3

P(Deck B | E) = [P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B)] / [P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A) + P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B)]
             = [(2/81) × (1/2)] / [(8/81) × (1/2) + (2/81) × (1/2)]
             = 1/3

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(Deck A | E) / P(Deck B | E) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 2}
