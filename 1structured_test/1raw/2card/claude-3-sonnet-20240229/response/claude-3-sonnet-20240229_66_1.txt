To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

The ratio of these posterior probabilities gives us the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E)
                = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the deck was selected by chance)

We can calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability formula:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

Posterior odds = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.0741 * 1/2)
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4:1.
