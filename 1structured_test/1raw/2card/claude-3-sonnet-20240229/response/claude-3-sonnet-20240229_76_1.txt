To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Equal prior probability of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.148

P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) = 0.296 * 1/2 + 0.148 * 1/2 = 0.222

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)) / (P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D))
                = (0.296 * 1/2 / 0.222) / (0.148 * 1/2 / 0.222)
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 2}
