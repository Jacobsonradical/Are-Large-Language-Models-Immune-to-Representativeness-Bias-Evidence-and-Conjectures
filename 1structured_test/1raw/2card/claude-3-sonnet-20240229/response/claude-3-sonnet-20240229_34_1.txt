To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 were marked X, and 1 was marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed outcome (3 X and 1 O) from Deck A as P(A|data) and from Deck B as P(B|data).

P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 8/27
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 2/27

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
