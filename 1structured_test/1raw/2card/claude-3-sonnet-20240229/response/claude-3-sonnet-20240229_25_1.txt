To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then calculate the odds ratio.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A
- P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B
- P(D|A) = Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A
- P(D|B) = Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck)
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3, and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3, and P(O) = 2/3

To calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), we use the binomial probability formula:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.1482
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (P(A) * P(D|A)) / (P(B) * P(D|B))
             = (0.5 * 0.1482) / (0.5 * 0.0741)
             = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 2}
