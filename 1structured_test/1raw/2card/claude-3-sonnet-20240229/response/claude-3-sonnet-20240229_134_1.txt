To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so we can ignore them in the calculation of the posterior odds.

The posterior odds of deck A compared to deck B are:
Posterior odds = (P(E | A) / P(E | B)) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
