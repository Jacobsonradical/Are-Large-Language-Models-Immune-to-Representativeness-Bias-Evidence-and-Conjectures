To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A, given the observed data.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the posterior odds of A given D, which can be expressed as:

P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0185 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula, we get:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((0.148 * 0.5) / P(D)) / ((0.0185 * 0.5) / P(D))
                = (0.074 / P(D)) / (0.00925 / P(D))
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 8:1.
