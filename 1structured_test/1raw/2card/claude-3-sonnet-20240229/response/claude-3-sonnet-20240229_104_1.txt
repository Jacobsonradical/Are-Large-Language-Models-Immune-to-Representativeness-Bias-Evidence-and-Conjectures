To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We draw 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the posterior probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck A as P(A|data) and the posterior probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck B as P(B|data).

Step 1: Calculate P(A|data)
P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate P(B|data)
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (8/9) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 3:1.

{odds: 3}
