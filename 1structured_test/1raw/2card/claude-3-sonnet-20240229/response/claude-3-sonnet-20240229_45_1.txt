To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A, and then find the odds ratio.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
X: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|X), the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed cards.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (Equal probability of selecting either deck initially)
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.037 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting the values:
P(A|X) = (0.148 * 0.5) / (0.148 * 0.5 + 0.037 * 0.5)
P(A|X) = 0.8

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
