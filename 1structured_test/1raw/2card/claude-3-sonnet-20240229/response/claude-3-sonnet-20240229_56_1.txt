To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed outcome from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing the observed outcome from Deck B as P(B).

Step 1: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of choosing 3 X cards and 1 O card from 4 cards)
P(A) = (8/27) × (1/3) × (4 choose 3)
P(A) = (8/81) × 4
P(A) = 32/81

Step 2: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of choosing 3 X cards and 1 O card from 4 cards)
P(B) = (1/27) × (2/3) × (4 choose 3)
P(B) = (2/81) × 4
P(B) = 8/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81)
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
