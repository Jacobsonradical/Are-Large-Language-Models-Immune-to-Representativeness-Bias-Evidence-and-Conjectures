To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed set of cards from Deck A as P(Data|A) and the probability of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B as P(Data|B).

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.
P(Data|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.
P(Data|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so the prior odds ratio is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B are:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
              = 1 × (P(Data|A) / P(Data|B))
              = 1 × (8/81) / (2/81)
              = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
