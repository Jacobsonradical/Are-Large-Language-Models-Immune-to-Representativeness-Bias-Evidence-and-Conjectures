To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We draw 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)

Prior odds = 1 (since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected)
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                = 0.148 / 0.0741
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 2:1.

{odds: 2}
