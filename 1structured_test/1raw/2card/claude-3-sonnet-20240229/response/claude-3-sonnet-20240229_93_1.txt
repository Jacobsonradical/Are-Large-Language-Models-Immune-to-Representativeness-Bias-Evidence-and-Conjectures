To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards marked X, 1/3 cards marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards marked X, 2/3 cards marked O.
- 4 cards drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Step 1: Calculate P(E|A), the probability of event E given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243

Step 2: Calculate P(E|B), the probability of event E given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of Deck A relative to Deck B.
Posterior odds = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] × (Prior odds)
Prior odds = 1 (since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected)

Posterior odds = (32/243) / (8/243) × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
