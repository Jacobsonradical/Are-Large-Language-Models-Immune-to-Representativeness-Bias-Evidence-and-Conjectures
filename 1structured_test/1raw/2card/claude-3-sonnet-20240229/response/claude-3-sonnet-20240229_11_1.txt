To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds ratio.
Posterior odds ratio = (Probability of drawing from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing from Deck B)
Posterior odds ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
