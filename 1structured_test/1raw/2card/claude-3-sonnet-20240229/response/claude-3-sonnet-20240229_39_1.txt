To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
A: Deck A is selected
B: Deck B is selected
X: Drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A given X, compared to B given X.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities as follows:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

We know that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since the deck is selected by chance.

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

P(X) is the same for both decks, so we can ignore it when calculating the odds.

The posterior odds of A given X, compared to B given X, are:
(P(A|X) * P(B|X)) / (P(B|X) * P(A|X)) = (8/81 * 2/81) / (2/81 * 8/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
