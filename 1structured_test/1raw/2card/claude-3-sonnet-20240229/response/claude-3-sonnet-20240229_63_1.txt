To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the likelihood ratio). This ratio will give us the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

The likelihood ratio is given by:
Likelihood ratio = P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

The posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are equal to the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds. Since we don't have any prior information about which deck was chosen, the prior odds are 1 (equal chances of selecting either deck).

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds = 4 × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
