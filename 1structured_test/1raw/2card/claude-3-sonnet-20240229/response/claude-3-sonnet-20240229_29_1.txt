To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards marked X, 1/3 cards marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards marked X, 2/3 cards marked O.
- 4 cards drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B.
Posterior odds = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)]
             = (32/243) / (8/243)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
