To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2962962962962963

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0740740740740741

Now, we need to find the posterior odds of A compared to B.

Posterior odds = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since we don't have any prior information about the decks, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Posterior odds = [P(E|A) / P(E|B)] * [0.5 / 0.5]
             = [0.2962962962962963 / 0.0740740740740741]
             = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
