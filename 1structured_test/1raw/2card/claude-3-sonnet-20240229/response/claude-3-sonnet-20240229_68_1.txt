To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of observing the given data (3 X cards and 1 O card) for each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which gives us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed data from Deck A as P(Data|A) and the probability of drawing the observed data from Deck B as P(Data|B).

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
P(Data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
P(Data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = P(Data|A) / P(Data|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
