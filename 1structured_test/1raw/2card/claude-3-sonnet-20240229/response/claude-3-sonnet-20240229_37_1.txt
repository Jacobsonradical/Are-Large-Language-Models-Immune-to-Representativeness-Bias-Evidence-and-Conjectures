To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities to obtain the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior probabilities of the two hypotheses given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Here, P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of the two hypotheses, which are equal (1/2) since we selected one of the decks at random.

P(D|A) is the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O if the cards were drawn from Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O.
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148

P(D|B) is the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O if the cards were drawn from Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O.
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0148

Substituting these values into the posterior probability formulas, we get:

P(A|D) = (0.148 * 1/2) / P(D) = 0.074 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (0.0148 * 1/2) / P(D) = 0.0074 / P(D)

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of these posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.074 / P(D)) / (0.0074 / P(D)) = 10

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 10:1.
