To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing the same from Deck B as P(B|data).

Step 1: Calculate P(A|data)
P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × (4 choose 3) = 32/243

Step 2: Calculate P(B|data)
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × (4 choose 3) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
