To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O), we need to calculate the likelihood ratio and multiply it by the prior odds.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Likelihood of observing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Likelihood of observing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Combined likelihood for Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Likelihood of observing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Likelihood of observing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Combined likelihood for Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood ratio.
Likelihood ratio = Likelihood for Deck A / Likelihood for Deck B
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Step 4: Assume equal prior odds for Deck A and Deck B (since no information is given about prior probabilities).
Prior odds = 1

Step 5: Calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio with the prior odds.
Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds
Posterior odds = 4 × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:
