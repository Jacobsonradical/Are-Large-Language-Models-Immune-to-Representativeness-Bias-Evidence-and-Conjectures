To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

The prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B are 1:1 (assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen).

We need to calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B.

Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963

Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

The likelihood ratio is:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 0.2963 / 0.0741 = 4

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
