To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
             = 1 * (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B))
             = 1 * (0.296 / 0.074)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
