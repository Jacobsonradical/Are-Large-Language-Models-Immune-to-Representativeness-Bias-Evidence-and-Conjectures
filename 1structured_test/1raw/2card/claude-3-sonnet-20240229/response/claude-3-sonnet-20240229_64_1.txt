To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of obtaining the observed outcome (3 X cards and 1 O card) for each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, we assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]
               = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
