To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of observing the given evidence (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) under each hypothesis (Deck A or Deck B), and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- Evidence: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of observing the evidence under the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Probability of observing the evidence (3X, 1O) from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of observing the evidence under the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 card marked O from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Probability of observing the evidence (3X, 1O) from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B.
Since we have no prior information about which deck was selected, the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of evidence under Deck A) / (Probability of evidence under Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:
