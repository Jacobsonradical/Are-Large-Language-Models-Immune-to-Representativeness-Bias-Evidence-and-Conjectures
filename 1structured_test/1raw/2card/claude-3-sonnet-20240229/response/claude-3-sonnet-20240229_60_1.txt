To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which gives us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A as P(A), and the probability of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B as P(B).

For Deck A:
Probability of drawing an X card = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card = 1/3

P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/81

For Deck B:
Probability of drawing an X card = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card = 2/3

P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/81

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio P(A) / P(B).

Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
