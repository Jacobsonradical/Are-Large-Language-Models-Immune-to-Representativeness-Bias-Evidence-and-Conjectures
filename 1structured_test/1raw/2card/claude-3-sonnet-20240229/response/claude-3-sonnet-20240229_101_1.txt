To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2962962962962963

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0740740740740741

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B are 1:1.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B, given the evidence E, are:

Posterior odds = (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (0.2962962962962963 / 0.0740740740740741) * 1
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
