To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of obtaining 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of obtaining 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be selected)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of obtaining 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of obtaining 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.074 = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
