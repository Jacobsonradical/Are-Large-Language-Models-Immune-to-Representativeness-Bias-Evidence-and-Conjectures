To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
E: 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck)

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.1482
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = (0.1482 * 1/2) / P(E) = 0.6667 / P(E)
P(B|E) = (0.0741 * 1/2) / P(E) = 0.3333 / P(E)

The odds ratio is P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (0.6667 / P(E)) / (0.3333 / P(E)) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed evidence of 3 X cards and 1 O card, is:

{odds: 2}
