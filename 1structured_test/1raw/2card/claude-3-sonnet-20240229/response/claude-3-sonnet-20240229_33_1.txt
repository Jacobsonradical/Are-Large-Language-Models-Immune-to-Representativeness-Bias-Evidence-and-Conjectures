To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A given the observed data.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which represents the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0370 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)

Substituting the values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [0.148 * 0.5] / [0.0370 * 0.5] = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data, are 4:1.
