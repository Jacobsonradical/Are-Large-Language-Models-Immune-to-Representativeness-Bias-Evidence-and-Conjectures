To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A, and the posterior odds of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B. Then, we can take the ratio of these two posterior odds to find the requested odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal since one of the decks is selected by chance.

The posterior odds of Deck A relative to Deck B are given by:
(P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) * (Prior odds of Deck A / Prior odds of Deck B)
= (8/81) / (2/81) * 1
= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
