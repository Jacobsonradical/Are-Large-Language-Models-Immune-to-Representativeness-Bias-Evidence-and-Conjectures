To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Let's define the following events:
A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
E: The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Given:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probability of selecting either deck)
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.296
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.148

Substituting these values, we get:
P(A|E) = 0.296 * 0.5 / P(E)
P(B|E) = 0.148 * 0.5 / P(E)

Dividing P(A|E) by P(B|E), we get:
(P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (0.296 / 0.148) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 2:1.
