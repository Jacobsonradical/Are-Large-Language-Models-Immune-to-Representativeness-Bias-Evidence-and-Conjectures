To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the prior probabilities of selecting each deck and the likelihood of the observed data.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Prior odds:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen)
P(B) = 1/2

Likelihood of the observed data:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 8/27 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 2/27 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
            = (P(A) / P(B)) × (P(E|A) / P(E|B))
            = (1/2 / 1/2) × ((8/27) / (2/27))
            = 1 × 4
            = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
