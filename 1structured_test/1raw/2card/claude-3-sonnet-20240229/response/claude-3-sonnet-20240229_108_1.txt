To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E.

The prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B is 1:1 since we are told that one of the decks was selected by chance.

We need to calculate the likelihood ratio P(E|A) / P(E|B), where P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is P(E|A) / P(E|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

The posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
                   = 1 * 4
                   = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
