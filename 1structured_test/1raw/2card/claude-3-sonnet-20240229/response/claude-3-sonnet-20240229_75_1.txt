To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The observed data (3 Xs and 1 O)

We want to find the posterior odds of A versus B, given the data D, which is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities as:

P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Since the decks were chosen at random, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), we need to consider the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3
P(O) = 1/3
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3
P(O) = 2/3
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

Posterior odds = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.0741 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
