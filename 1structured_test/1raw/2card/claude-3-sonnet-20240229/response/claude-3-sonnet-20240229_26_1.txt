To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities (the odds).

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (4 choose 3) = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/81) × (4 choose 3) = 32/243

The posterior odds of Deck A over Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)) × (Prior odds)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected, we can assume equal prior probabilities, making the prior odds 1.

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (32/243) = 81/32 = 2.53125

{odds: 2.53125}
