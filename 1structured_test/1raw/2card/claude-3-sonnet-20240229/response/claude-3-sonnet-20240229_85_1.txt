To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)

Prior odds = 1 (since there is no prior information about which deck was selected)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.2963 / 0.0741 = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
