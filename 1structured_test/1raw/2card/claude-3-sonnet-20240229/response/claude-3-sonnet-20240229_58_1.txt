To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.2963 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A)

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0741 (probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B are 1:1 or 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A over Deck B are:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = 0.2963 / 0.0741 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of Deck A over Deck B are:
Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

{odds: 4}
