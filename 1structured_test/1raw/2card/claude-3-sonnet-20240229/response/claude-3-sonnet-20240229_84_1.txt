To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio and multiply it by the prior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 were marked X, and 1 was marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Likelihood of drawing from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Likelihood of drawing from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood ratio.
Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of drawing from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing from Deck B
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Step 4: Assume equal prior odds (no prior information favoring either deck).
Prior odds = 1

Step 5: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds
Posterior odds = 4 × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
