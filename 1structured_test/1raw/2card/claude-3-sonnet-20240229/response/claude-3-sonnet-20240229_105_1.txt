To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 3: Calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem.
P(Deck A | E) = (P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A)) / (P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A) + P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B))
P(Deck B | E) = (P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B)) / (P(E | Deck A) × P(Deck A) + P(E | Deck B) × P(Deck B))

Since the decks were selected by chance, we can assume P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5.

P(Deck A | E) = (0.2963 × 0.5) / (0.2963 × 0.5 + 0.0741 × 0.5) = 0.8
P(Deck B | E) = (0.0741 × 0.5) / (0.2963 × 0.5 + 0.0741 × 0.5) = 0.2

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = P(Deck A | E) / P(Deck B | E) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
