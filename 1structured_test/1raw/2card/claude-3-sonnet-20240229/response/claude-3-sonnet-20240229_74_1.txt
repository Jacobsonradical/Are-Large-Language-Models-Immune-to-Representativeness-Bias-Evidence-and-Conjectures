To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed set of cards (3 X and 1 O) from Deck A as P(A|data) and the probability of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B as P(B|data).

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The observed data is 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We can calculate the probabilities using the binomial probability formula:

P(A|data) = P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243
P(B|data) = P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
