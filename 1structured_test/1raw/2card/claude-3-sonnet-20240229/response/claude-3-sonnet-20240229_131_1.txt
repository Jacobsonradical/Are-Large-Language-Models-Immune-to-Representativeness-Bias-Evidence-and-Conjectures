To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
Posterior odds = 1 * (P(E | A) / P(E | B))
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
