To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B.
Since both decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior odds = 1.

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood ratio.
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1
Likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1

Likelihood ratio = (Likelihood of drawing from Deck A) / (Likelihood of drawing from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1]
Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (1/27) = 8

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Posterior odds = 1 × 8 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 8}
