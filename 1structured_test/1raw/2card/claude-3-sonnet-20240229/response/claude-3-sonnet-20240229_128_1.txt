To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of the same outcome from Deck B as P(B).

For Deck A:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from the deck)
P(A) = (8/27) × (1/3) × (Number of ways to choose 3 X cards out of 2/3 of the deck) × (Number of ways to choose 1 O card out of 1/3 of the deck)
P(A) = (8/27) × (1/3) × (2/3 × C(n, 3)) × (1/3 × C(n, 1))
P(A) = (8/81) × (2/3 × n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (1/3 × n!/(n - 1)!1!)
P(A) = (16/243) × (2n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (n!/(n - 1)!1!)

For Deck B:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from the deck)
P(B) = (1/27) × (2/3) × (Number of ways to choose 3 X cards out of 1/3 of the deck) × (Number of ways to choose 1 O card out of 2/3 of the deck)
P(B) = (1/27) × (2/3) × (1/3 × C(n, 3)) × (2/3 × C(n, 1))
P(B) = (2/81) × (1/3 × n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (2/3 × n!/(n - 1)!1!)
P(B) = (4/243) × (n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (2n!/(n - 1)!1!)

The posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio P(A) / P(B).

P(A) / P(B) = (16/243) × (2n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (n!/(n - 1)!1!) / ((4/243) × (n!/(n - 3)!3!) × (2n!/(n - 1)!1!))
P(A) / P(B) = (16 × (n - 1)!) / (4 × 2 × (n - 3)!)
P(A) / P(B) = 4 × (n - 1)! / (n - 3)!

Since n is a very large number, the factorial terms will be very large, and their ratio will be a very large number.
