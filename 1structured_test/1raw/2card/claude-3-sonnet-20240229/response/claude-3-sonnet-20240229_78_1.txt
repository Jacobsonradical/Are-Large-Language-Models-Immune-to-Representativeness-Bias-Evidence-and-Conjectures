To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (4 choose 3) = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (2/27) * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

The posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = (P(E|A) / P(E|B)) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
