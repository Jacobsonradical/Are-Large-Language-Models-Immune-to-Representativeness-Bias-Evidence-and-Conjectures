To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We draw 4 cards, and we observe 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.148

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood ratio)
Prior odds = 1 (since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = 0.296 / 0.148 = 2

Posterior odds = 1 × 2 = 2
