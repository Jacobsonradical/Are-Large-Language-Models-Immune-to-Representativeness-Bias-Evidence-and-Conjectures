To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio and multiply it by the prior odds.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of getting 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A.
Likelihood of getting 3 Xs from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Likelihood of getting 1 O from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Likelihood of getting the observed data from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of getting 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B.
Likelihood of getting 3 Xs from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Likelihood of getting 1 O from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Likelihood of getting the observed data from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood ratio.
Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of getting the observed data from Deck A / Likelihood of getting the observed data from Deck B
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Step 4: Assume equal prior odds of selecting either deck (prior odds = 1).

Step 5: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds
Posterior odds = 4 × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
