To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to find the ratio of the likelihoods of observing the given data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under the two hypotheses (Deck A and Deck B).

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Under the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A:
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Under the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B:
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is:
P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the two decks, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A are simply the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 4}
