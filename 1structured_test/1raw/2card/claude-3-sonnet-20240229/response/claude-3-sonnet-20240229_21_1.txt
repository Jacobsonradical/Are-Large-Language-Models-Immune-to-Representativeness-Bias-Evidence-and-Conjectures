To solve this problem, we need to calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1
Likelihood of the observed data from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of obtaining the observed data from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1
Likelihood of the observed data from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Likelihood of data from Deck A / Likelihood of data from Deck B) × Prior odds
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) × 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.
