To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We drew 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 3: Find the ratio of the probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Posterior odds = 0.296 / 0.148 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 2}
