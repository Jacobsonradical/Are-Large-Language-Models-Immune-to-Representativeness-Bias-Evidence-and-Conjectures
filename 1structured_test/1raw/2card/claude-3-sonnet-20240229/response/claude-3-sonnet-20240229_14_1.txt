To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A | E) = (P(E | A) × P(A)) / (P(E | A) × P(A) + P(E | B) × P(B))
         = (8/81 × 1/2) / (8/81 × 1/2 + 2/81 × 1/2)
         = 4/5

P(B | E) = (P(E | B) × P(B)) / (P(E | A) × P(A) + P(E | B) × P(B))
         = (2/81 × 1/2) / (8/81 × 1/2 + 2/81 × 1/2)
         = 1/5

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(A | E) / P(B | E) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
