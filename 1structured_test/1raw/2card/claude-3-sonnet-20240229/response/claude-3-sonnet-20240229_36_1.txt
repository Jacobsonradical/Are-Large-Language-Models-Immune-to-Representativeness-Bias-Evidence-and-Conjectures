To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of event E for Deck A, P(E|A).
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × 1 (since the deck is very large)
≈ 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of event E for Deck B, P(E|B).
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × 1 (since the deck is very large)
≈ 0.074

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (P(E|A) / P(E|B))
≈ (0.296 / 0.074)
≈ 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
