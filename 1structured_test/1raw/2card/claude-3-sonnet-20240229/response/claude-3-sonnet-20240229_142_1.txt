To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B (assuming equal prior probabilities).
Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × P(3X, 1O | A)) / P(3X, 1O | B)
Posterior odds = (1 × 0.2963) / 0.0741 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
