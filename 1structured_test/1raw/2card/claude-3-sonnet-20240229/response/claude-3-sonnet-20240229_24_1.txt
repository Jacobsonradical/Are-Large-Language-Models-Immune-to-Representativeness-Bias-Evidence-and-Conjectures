To calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem and find the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) under the two hypotheses (Deck A and Deck B), multiplied by the prior odds of selecting each deck.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

The prior probability of selecting Deck A and Deck B is equal since both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, so the prior odds are 1:1.

The likelihood of observing E given Deck A is:
P(E|Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296

The likelihood of observing E given Deck B is:
P(E|Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.074

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
             = 1 * (P(E|Deck A) / P(E|Deck B))
             = 1 * (0.296 / 0.074)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
