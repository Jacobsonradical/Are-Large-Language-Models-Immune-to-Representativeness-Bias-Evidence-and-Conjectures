To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take their ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 2/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.296

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 1 X card = 1/3
Probability of drawing 1 O card = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing from Deck B)
Posterior odds = 0.296 / 0.074 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
