To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B).

Step 1: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
