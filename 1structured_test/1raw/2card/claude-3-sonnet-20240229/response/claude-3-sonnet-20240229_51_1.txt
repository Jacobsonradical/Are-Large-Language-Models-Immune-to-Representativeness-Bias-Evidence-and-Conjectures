To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then calculate the posterior odds based on these probabilities.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing the same from Deck B as P(B).

P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A) / P(B)) × (Prior odds)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck was chosen, we can assume the prior odds to be 1.

Posterior odds = (P(A) / P(B)) × 1
             = (8/81) / (2/81)
             = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
