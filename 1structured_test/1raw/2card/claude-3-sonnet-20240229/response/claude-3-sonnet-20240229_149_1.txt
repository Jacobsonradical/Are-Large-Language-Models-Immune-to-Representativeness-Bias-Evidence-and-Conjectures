To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which is the posterior odds of drawing the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), we need to consider the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

Substituting these values into the equations for P(A|D) and P(B|D), we get:

P(A|D) = (32/243 * 0.5) / P(D) = 16/243 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (8/243 * 0.5) / P(D) = 4/243 / P(D)

The posterior odds are given by P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (16/243 / P(D)) / (4/243 / P(D)) = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
