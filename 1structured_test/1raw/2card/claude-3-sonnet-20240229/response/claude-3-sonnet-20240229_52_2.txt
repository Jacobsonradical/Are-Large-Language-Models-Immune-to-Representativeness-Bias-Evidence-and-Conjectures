To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of the same outcome from Deck B as P(B).

P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by the ratio of the probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
