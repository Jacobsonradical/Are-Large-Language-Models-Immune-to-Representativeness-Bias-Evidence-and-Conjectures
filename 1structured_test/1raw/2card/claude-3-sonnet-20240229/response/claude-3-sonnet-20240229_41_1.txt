To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing the given set of cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which gives us the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing the given set of cards from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing the same set of cards from Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
