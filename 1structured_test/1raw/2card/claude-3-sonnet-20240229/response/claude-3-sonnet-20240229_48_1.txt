To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B as P(B).

For Deck A:
P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (Combinations of 4 cards taken from the deck)
P(A) = (8/27) * (1/3) * (Number of cards in the deck choose 4)
P(A) = (8/81) * (Number of cards in the deck choose 4)

For Deck B:
P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (Combinations of 4 cards taken from the deck)
P(B) = (1/27) * (2/3) * (Number of cards in the deck choose 4)
P(B) = (2/81) * (Number of cards in the deck choose 4)

Since the decks are very large, the combination term (Number of cards in the deck choose 4) will be the same for both decks.

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior Odds = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

{odds: 4}
