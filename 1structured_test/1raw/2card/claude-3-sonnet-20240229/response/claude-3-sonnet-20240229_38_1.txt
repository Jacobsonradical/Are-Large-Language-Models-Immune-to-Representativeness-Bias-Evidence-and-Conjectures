To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B (assumed to be equal since no information is given).
Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
