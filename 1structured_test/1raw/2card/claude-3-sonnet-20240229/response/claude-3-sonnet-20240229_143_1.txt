To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing the observed cards (3 X and 1 O) as E.

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)
Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds are 1 (equal probability for both decks).

Likelihood ratio = P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B)

To calculate the likelihood ratio, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck.

P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
                = 1 × 4
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are 4:1.
