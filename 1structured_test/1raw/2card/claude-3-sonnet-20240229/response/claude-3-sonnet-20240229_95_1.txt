To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the likelihoods of observing the given data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under the two hypotheses (Deck A and Deck B), multiplied by the prior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1 (since we don't have any prior information about which deck was selected)

Likelihood of E under Deck A (where P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3):
P(E | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

Likelihood of E under Deck B (where P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3):
P(E | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
               = 1 * (P(E | Deck A) / P(E | Deck B))
               = 1 * (0.2963 / 0.0741)
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4:1.
