To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which represents the posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck)
- In Deck A: P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B: P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0185 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [0.148 * 0.5] / [0.0185 * 0.5] = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data, are 8:1.
