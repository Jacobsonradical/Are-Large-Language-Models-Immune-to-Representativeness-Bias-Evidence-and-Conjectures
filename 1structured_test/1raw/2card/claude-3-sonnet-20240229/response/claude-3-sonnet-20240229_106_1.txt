To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as D.

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3.
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3.

We want to find the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

We can assume that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4, 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4, 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/243) * (1/2)] / [(8/243) * (1/2)] = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
