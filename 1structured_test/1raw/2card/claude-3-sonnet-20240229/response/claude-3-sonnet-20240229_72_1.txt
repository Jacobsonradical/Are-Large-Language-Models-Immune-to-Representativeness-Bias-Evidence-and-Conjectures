To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of event E for deck A, P(E|A).
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 2: Calculate the probability of event E for deck B, P(E|B).
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (Combination of 4 cards from a large deck)
≈ (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of deck A over deck B.
Posterior odds = (P(E|A) / P(E|B)) × (Prior odds of deck A over deck B)

Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds are 1.

Posterior odds = (0.148 / 0.0741) × 1 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 2}
