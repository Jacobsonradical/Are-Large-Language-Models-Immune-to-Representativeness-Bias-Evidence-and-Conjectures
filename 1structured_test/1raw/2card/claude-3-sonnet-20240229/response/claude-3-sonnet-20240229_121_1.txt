To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards marked X, 1/3 cards marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards marked X, 2/3 cards marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks were equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) * (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4 to 1.
