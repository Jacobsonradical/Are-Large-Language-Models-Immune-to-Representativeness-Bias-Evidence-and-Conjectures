To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of the given event (drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) for each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: The event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A relative to B, given the event E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities as follows:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) × P(A)) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) × P(B)) / P(E)

Since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × C(4, 3) = 0.148148148

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × C(4, 3) = 0.037037037

P(E) = P(E|A) × P(A) + P(E|B) × P(B) = 0.148148148 × 0.5 + 0.037037037 × 0.5 = 0.0925925925

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|E) = (0.148148148 × 0.5) / 0.0925925925 = 0.8
P(B|E) = (0.037037037 × 0.5) / 0.0925925925 = 0.2

The posterior odds of A relative to B, given E, are:
Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
