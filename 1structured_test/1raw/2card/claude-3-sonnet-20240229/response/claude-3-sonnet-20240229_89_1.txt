To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, and then take their ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are marked X, and 1/3 cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are marked X, and 2/3 cards are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing from Deck B)
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
