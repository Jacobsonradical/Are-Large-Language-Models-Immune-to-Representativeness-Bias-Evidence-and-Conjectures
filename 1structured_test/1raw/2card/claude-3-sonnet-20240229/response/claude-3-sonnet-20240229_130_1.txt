To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = [P(E | A) / P(E | B)] = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
