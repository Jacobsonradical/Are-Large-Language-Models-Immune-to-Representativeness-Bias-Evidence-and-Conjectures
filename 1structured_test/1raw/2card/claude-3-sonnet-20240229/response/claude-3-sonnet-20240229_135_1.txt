To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on the observed data.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We observe 3 X cards and 1 O card in a sample of 4 cards.

Let's denote the event of drawing the observed sample from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing the observed sample from Deck B as B.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of the observed data under each hypothesis.
Likelihood of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = P(data | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
Likelihood of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = P(data | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Step 2: Assume equal prior odds for Deck A and Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds × Likelihood of data under A) / (Prior odds × Likelihood of data under B)
Posterior odds = (0.5 × 0.2963) / (0.5 × 0.0741) = 4

{odds: 4}
