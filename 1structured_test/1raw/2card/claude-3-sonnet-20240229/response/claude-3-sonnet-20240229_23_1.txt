To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O as E.

For Deck A:
P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

We also need to know the prior probabilities of selecting each deck, which are assumed to be equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(E | A) * P(A)) / (P(E | B) * P(B))
               = ((8/81) * (1/2)) / ((2/81) * (1/2))
               = 4

{odds: 4}
