To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card) under the two hypotheses (Deck A or Deck B), and multiply it by the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B.

Prior odds: Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B is 1:1 or 1.

Likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (8/27) × (1/3) × 4 = 32/243

Likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = (1/27) × (2/3) × 4 = 8/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
                = 1 × 4
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4:1.
