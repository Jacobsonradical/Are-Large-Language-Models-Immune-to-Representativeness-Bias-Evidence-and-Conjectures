To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the prior odds of selecting deck A versus deck B.
Prior odds = 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be selected)

Step 4: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)
Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
