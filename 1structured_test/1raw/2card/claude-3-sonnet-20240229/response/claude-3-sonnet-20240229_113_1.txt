To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O), given the observed data of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A and the event of drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is denoted as D.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which represents the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data D.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) × P(A)] / [P(D|B) × P(B)]

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The observed data D is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We can calculate the likelihoods P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability distribution.

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.2963
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.0741

Assuming equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [0.2963 × 0.5] / [0.0741 × 0.5] = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 4}
