To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on the observed data.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards marked X, 1/3 cards marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 cards marked X, 2/3 cards marked O.
- Observed data: 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of observing the data from Deck A.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A = (1/3)^1 = 1/3
Likelihood of observing the data from Deck A = (8/27) × (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing the data from Deck B.
Probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
Probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B = (2/3)^1 = 2/3
Likelihood of observing the data from Deck B = (1/27) × (2/3) = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) × (Likelihood ratio)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, the prior odds are 1.

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood of observing the data from Deck A / Likelihood of observing the data from Deck B
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (the deck where most cards are marked O) are 4 to 1.
