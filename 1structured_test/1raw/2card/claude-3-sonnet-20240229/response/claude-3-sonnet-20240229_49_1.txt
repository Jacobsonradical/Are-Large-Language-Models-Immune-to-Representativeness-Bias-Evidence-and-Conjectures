To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

Let's denote the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A as P(3X, 1O | A), and the probability of observing the same outcome from Deck B as P(3X, 1O | B).

For Deck A:
P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
