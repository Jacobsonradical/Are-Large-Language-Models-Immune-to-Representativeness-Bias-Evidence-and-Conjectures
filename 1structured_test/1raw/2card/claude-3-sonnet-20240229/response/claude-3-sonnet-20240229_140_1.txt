To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing the observed set of cards (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

We want to find the posterior odds: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Given information:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probability of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0185 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [0.148 * 0.5] / [0.0185 * 0.5] = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8:1.

{odds: 8}
