To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of the cards being drawn from Deck A and Deck B, and then take the ratio of these probabilities to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing the cards from Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.2963

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.0741

The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, assuming they were chosen at random.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) × P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | A) × P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) × P(B)]
P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | B) × P(B)] / [P(3X, 1O | A) × P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) × P(B)]

Substituting the values:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = (0.2963 × 0.5) / (0.2963 × 0.5 + 0.0741 × 0.5) = 0.8
P(B | 3X, 1O) = (0.0741 × 0.5) / (0.2963 × 0.5 + 0.0741 × 0.5) = 0.2

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
