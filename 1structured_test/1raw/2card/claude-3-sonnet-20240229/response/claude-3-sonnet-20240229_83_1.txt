To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, and 3 were marked X, and 1 was marked O.

Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A as P(A|data), and the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B as P(B|data).

P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
