To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the odds ratio.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 0.148

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 0.074

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds ratio.
Posterior odds ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)
Posterior odds ratio = 0.148 / 0.074 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O) are:

{odds: 2}
