To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as E.

For Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/243

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
       = (32/243 * 1/2) / (32/243 * 1/2 + 8/243 * 1/2)
       = 32/40
       = 4/5

P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
       = (8/243 * 1/2) / (32/243 * 1/2 + 8/243 * 1/2)
       = 8/40
       = 1/5

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are:
(P(A|E) / P(B|E)) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
