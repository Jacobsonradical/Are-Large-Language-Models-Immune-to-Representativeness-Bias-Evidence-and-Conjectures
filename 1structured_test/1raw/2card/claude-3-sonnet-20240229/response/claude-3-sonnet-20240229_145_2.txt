To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then take the ratio of these probabilities to find the posterior odds.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- We draw 4 cards, and 3 of them are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck A = 2/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck A = 1/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.2962962963

Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
Probability of drawing an X card from Deck B = 1/3
Probability of drawing an O card from Deck B = 2/3
Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 × (4 choose 3) = 0.0740740741

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B.
Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B)
Posterior odds = 0.2962962963 / 0.0740740741 = 4

{odds: 4}
