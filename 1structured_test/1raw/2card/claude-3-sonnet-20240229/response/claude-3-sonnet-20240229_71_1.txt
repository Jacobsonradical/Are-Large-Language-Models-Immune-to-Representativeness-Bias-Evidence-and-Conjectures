To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability of each deck being selected, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), and then find the ratio of these probabilities.

Let's denote the events:
A: Deck A was selected
B: Deck B was selected
D: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn

We want to find the posterior odds of A to B, which is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior probabilities as:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can assume they are equal (i.e., both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially).

The likelihood of observing the data D given each deck is:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.148
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.0370

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
              = (0.148 * P(A)) / (0.0370 * P(B))
              = 4 * (P(A) / P(B))

Since we assumed equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B), so the posterior odds simplify to:

Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
