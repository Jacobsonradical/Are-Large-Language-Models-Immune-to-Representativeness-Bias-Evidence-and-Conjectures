To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio. In this case, the event is drawing 4 cards from either Deck A or Deck B, and we want to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.

First, let's calculate the prior odds. Since there are no preferences given for Decks A and B, we assume equal probabilities for both decks. So the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A to the same probabilities given Deck B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
- There are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's in Deck A.
- The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is C(13, 3) * C(13, 1), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- The probability is then [C(13, 3) * C(13, 1)] / C(26, 4)

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
- There are 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's in Deck B.
- The number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards is C(13, 3) * C(26, 1), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- The probability is then [C(13, 3) * C(26, 1)] / C(52, 4)

Now we calculate the likelihood ratio by dividing the probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = [P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)] / [P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

Calculating the values, we get:

Posterior odds = 1 * [(C(13, 3) * C(13, 1)) / C(26, 4)] / [(C(13, 3) * C(26, 1)) / C(52, 4)] â‰ˆ 0.095

So the posterior odds are approximately 0.095 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
