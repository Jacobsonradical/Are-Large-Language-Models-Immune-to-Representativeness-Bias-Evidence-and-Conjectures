To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
- First choose 3 out of the 2/3 of the cards that are X's in Deck A, which is (2/3)^3.
- Then choose 1 out of the 1/3 of the cards that are O's in Deck A, which is (1/3)^1.
- There are a total of 2/3 of cards marked X and 1/3 marked O in Deck A, so there are a total of (2/3 + 1/3) = 1 card in the deck.
- Thus, the probability is given by: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / 1 = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
- First choose 3 out of the 1/3 of the cards that are X's in Deck B, which is (1/3)^3.
- Then choose 1 out of the 2/3 of the cards that are O's in Deck B, which is (2/3)^1.
- There are a total of 1/3 of cards marked X and 2/3 marked O in Deck B, so there are a total of (1/3 + 2/3) = 1 card in the deck.
- Thus, the probability is given by: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 / 1 = (1/27) * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2

Finally, the posterior odds can be calculated as follows:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 0.5 * (8/2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4.
