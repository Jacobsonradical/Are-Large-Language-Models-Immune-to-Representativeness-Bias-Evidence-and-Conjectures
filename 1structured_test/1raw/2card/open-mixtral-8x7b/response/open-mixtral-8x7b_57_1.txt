To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before looking at the cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 729/12

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (729/12) = 60.75

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are approximately 60.75.
