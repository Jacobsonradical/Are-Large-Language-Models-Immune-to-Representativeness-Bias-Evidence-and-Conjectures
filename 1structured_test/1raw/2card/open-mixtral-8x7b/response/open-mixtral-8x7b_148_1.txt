To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B before drawing any cards. If we assume that both decks have the same number of cards, then the probability of selecting either deck is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A and Deck B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = Probability of drawing from Deck A / Probability of drawing from Deck B
= (16/81) / (2/81)
= 16/2
= 8

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * 8
= 8

Therefore, the posterior odds are 8. This means that, based on the observed outcome of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, it is 8 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
