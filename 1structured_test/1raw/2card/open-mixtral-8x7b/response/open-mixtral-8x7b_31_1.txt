To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In our case, event A is drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, and event B is having 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We want to find the odds of A given B, which can be written as:

odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(not A|B)

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(not A). Since both decks have the same number of cards, the probabilities of selecting either deck are equal. Therefore,

P(A) = P(not A) = 1/2

Next, let's find the likelihoods P(B|A) and P(B|not A). Given that Deck A has 2/3 of its cards marked X, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck A is:

P(3 X's from A) = C(2/3 * n, 3) / C(n, 3)

where n is the total number of cards in each deck. Since n is large, we can approximate the combinations as:

P(3 X's from A) ≈ (2/3)^3 ≈ 0.296

Similarly, given that Deck B has 1/3 of its cards marked X, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X from Deck B is:

P(3 X's from not A) = C(1/3 * n, 3) / C(n, 3)

Again, approximating the combinations for large n:

P(3 X's from not A) ≈ (1/3)^3 ≈ 0.037

Now, let's find the likelihoods P(B and A) and P(B and not A). Since the number of marked cards in the decks is fixed, the probability of having 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O is the same regardless of the deck chosen:

P(B and A) = P(B and not A) = P(3 X's and 1 O) = 3! / (3! * 1!) * (0.296)^3 * (0.704) ≈ 0.064

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(not A|B) = P(B and A) * P(A) / (P(B and A) * P(A) + P(B and not A) * P(not A)) ≈ 0.55

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, are approximately 0.55.
