To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O without considering the given information is:

P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B separately.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (since A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's)
P(3X, 1O | A) ≈ 0.20508

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (since B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's)
P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 0.02744

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 7.485

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds with the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR ≈ (1/2) * 7.485 = 3.7425

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 3.7425.
