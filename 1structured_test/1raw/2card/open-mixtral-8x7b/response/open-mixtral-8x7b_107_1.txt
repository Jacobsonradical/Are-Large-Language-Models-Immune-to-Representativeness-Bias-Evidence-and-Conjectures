To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or B before seeing any cards. Since both decks have an equal chance of being selected, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's find the probabilities for Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: 1/3

Since we know that 3 cards are X's and 1 is an O, the probability of this specific outcome from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

Now let's find the probabilities for Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: 2/3

Since we know that 3 cards are X's and 1 is an O, the probability of this specific outcome from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
8/27 / (2/243) = 8/27 \* 121.5 = 32.46

Next, we multiply the prior odds (1) and the likelihood ratio (32.46) to find the posterior odds:
{odds: 32.46}
