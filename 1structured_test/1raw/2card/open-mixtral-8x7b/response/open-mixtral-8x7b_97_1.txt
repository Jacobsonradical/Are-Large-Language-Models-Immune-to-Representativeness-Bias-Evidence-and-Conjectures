To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being selected, which is 1:1 or 1 in this case.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4/81

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (4/81) = 2

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 2 = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2.
