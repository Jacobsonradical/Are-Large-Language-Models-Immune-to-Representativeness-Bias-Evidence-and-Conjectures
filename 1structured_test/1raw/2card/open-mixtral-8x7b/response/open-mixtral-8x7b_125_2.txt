To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(3X, 1O|A) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(3X, 1O|B).

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Posterior odds:
Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 8/2

{odds: 4}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
