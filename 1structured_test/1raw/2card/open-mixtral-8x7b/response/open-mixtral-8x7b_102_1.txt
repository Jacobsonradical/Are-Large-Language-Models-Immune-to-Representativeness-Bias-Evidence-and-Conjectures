To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The event of selecting Deck A
B: The event of selecting Deck B
C: The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from a randomly chosen deck

We want to find P(A|C)/P(B|C), which are the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A instead of Deck B. To find these probabilities, we need to calculate the following:

1. P(C|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
2. P(C|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
3. P(A) and P(B): The prior probabilities of selecting Decks A and B, which we assume are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. P(C|A) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck A)
= (10 choose 3) / (20 choose 4)
= (10*9*8)/(20*19*18*17)
= 120 / 1140
= 1 / 9.5

2. P(C|B) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from Deck B)
= (20 choose 3) / (60 choose 4)
= (20*19*18)/(60*59*58*57)
= 1140 / 51450
= 23 / 1029

3. P(A|C) = P(C|A) * P(A) / (P(C|A) * P(A) + P(C|B) * P(B))
= (1/9.5) * (1/2) / ((1/9.5) * (1/2) + (23/1029) * (1/2))
= 1029 / (1029 + 23)
= 1029 / 1052

So, the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A instead of Deck B are:

{odds: 1029 / 23}
