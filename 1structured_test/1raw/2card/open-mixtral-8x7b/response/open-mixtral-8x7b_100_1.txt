To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, event A is drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, and event B is having 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) is the probability of selecting Deck A, which is 1/2 since there are only two decks.
- P(not A) is the probability of selecting Deck B, which is also 1/2.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods:
- P(B|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've chosen Deck A. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 2/3 of the deck, multiplied by the number of ways to choose 1 O out of 1/3 of the deck, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of the entire deck. This simplifies to (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81.
- P(B|not A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've chosen Deck B. This can be calculated similarly to the previous likelihood, which simplifies to (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/243.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = P(A|B) / P(not A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/243 * 1/2) = 24/2 = 12

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is 12.
