To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods of the observations under each hypothesis.

Prior probabilities:

* P(A) = 1/2 (since we choose between decks A and B with equal probability)
* P(B) = 1/2

Likelihoods:

* P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27
* P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

* P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
* P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

We can calculate the normalization constant P(3X, 1O) as follows:

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(B)
= (8/27)*(1/2) + (2/243)*(1/2)
= 46/486

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

* P(A | 3X, 1O) = (8/27)*(1/2) / (46/486) = 12/23
* P(B | 3X, 1O) = (2/243)*(1/2) / (46/486) = 1/23

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
= 12/23 / 1/23
= 12

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 12 to 1.
