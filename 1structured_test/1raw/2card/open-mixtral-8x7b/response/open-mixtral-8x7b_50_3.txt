To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are drawing 4 cards from either Deck A or Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let A and B denote the events "drawing 4 cards from Deck A" and "drawing 4 cards from Deck B", respectively.

We want to find P(A|3X,1O), the probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck A given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O)

We know P(A) and P(B) (the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively) are equal, since both decks are equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, P(3X,1O|A), can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (which has a 2/3 chance of X and 1/3 chance of O on each card) divided by the total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A. This simplifies to (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, P(3X,1O|B), is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/243.

To find P(3X,1O), we can use the law of total probability:

P(3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) \* P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) \* P(B)

Plugging in our values, we have:

P(3X,1O) = (8/81) \* (1/2) + (2/243) \* (1/2) = 46/486

Now we can calculate P(A|3X,1O) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) \* P(A) / P(3X,1O)

P(A|3X,1O) = (8/81) \* (1/2) / (46/486)

P(A|3X,1O) = 24/46

The posterior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A and Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O. So the posterior odds are:

{odds: 24/22}

This means that, given the observed outcomes, it is approximately 24 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
