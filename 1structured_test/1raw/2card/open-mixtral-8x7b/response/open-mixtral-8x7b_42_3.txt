To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and B should be equal, as there is no preference for either deck. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B are (2/3)^3 * (1/3) and (1/3)^3 * (2/3), respectively. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = [P(3X from A) * P(A)] / [P(3X from B) * P(B)] = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = 2^3 = 8

Likelihood ratio: Now let's find the likelihood ratio of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and B.

L(A) / L(B) = [P(3X, 1O from A) / P(3X, 1O total)] / [P(3X, 1O from B) / P(3X, 1O total)]

P(3X, 1O total) is the same for both decks: 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4

P(3X, 1O from A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8
P(3X, 1O from B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4/3

So, L(A) / L(B) = (8) / (4/3) = 6

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 8 * 6 = 48

{odds: 48}
