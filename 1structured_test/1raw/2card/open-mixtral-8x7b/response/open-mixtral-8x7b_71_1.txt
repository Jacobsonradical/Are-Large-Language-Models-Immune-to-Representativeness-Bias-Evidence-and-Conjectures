To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior probabilities for selecting decks A and B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from decks A and B, given the proportions of X's and O's in each deck.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1, compared to Deck B.
