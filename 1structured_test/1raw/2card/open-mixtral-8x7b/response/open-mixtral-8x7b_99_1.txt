To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, and then calculate the likelihood ratio.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio: L = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4 = 81

Posterior odds: Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 : 1) * 81 = 81 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 81 to 1, compared to Deck B.
