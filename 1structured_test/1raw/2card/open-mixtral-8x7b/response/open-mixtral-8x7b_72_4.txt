To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, while deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. If we select a deck randomly, the probability of choosing deck A is 1/2, and the probability of choosing deck B is also 1/2.

Now, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O if we had chosen deck A or deck B.

For deck A:
- Probability of 3 X's and 1 O = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For deck B:
- Probability of 3 X's and 1 O = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = L(A) / L(B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 8 = 4

So, the posterior odds are {odds: 4}.
