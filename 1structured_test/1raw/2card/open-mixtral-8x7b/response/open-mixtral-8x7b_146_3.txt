To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each deck. The prior probabilities are the probabilities of selecting either deck A or deck B before any cards are drawn, which we can assume are equal (50% each). The likelihoods are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have selected either deck A or deck B.

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 8/81

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Next, we can calculate the posterior probabilities by multiplying the prior probabilities by the likelihoods and normalizing the results so that the probabilities sum to 1.

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) = (1/2) \* (8/81) / ((1/2) \* (8/81) + (1/2) \* (2/81)) = 4/5

P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = (1/2) \* (2/81) / ((1/2) \* (8/81) + (1/2) \* (2/81)) = 1/5

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the posterior probability of Deck A by the posterior probability of Deck B.

Odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = 4/5 / 1/5 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1. This means that the probability of Deck A being the selected deck given the observed data is four times higher than the probability of Deck B being the selected deck.
