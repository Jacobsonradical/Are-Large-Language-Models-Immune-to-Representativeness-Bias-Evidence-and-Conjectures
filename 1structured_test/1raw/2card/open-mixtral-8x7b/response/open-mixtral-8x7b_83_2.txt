To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is also 1/2.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Decks A and B.

1. Deck A: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 8/81.
2. Deck B: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81.

Likelihood ratio = L(A|X3O1) / L(B|X3O1) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 4 = 2.

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is 2.
