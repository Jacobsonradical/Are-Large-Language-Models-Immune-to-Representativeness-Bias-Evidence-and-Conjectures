To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote event A as "drawing 4 cards from Deck A" and event B as "drawing 4 cards from Deck B". We want to find the posterior odds of A given the observed evidence (3 X's and 1 O).

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
- P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of observing 3 X's and 1 O under each hypothesis.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
