To solve this problem, we need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then multiply them together to get the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the prior odds. The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, which is 1/2. The probability of selecting 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O from Deck A is:

(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27

The probability of selecting 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O from Deck B is:

(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27

So the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) \* P(3X, 1O | A) / P(B) \* P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/2) \* (8/27) / (1/2) \* (2/27) = 4

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is the probability of observing 3 marked X and 1 marked O in the sample, given that the sample came from Deck A, divided by the probability of observing 3 marked X and 1 marked O in the sample, given that the sample came from Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio = 4 \* 4 = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 16.
