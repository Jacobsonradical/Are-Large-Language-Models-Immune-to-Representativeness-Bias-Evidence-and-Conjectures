To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 16/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/81 / 2/81 = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8.
