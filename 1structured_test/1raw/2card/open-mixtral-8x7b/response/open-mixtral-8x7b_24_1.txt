To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B before drawing any cards. Both decks have an equal chance of being selected, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A and Deck B.

Let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards from 2/3 of Deck A)
= (2/3 choose 3) * (1/3 choose 1) / (2/3 choose 4)
= (2*1*1*1) / (2*1*1*1*1*1)
= 1/6

P(3X, 1O | B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards from 1/3 of Deck B)
= (1/3 choose 3) * (2/3 choose 1) / (1/3 choose 4)
= (1*1*1*2) / (1*1*1*1*1*1)
= 2/3

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/6) / (2/3) = 1/4

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (1/4) = 1/4
