To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, given that each deck has a large number of cards.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Here, N is the total number of cards in each deck, and C(a, b) is the number of combinations of "a" items taken "b" at a time.

Since N is very large, we can approximate these combinations using the binomial probability function:

P(3X, 1O | A) ≈ (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4

Posterior odds:
Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4, meaning that the probability of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A is 4 times the probability of having drawn them from Deck B, given the observed outcome.
