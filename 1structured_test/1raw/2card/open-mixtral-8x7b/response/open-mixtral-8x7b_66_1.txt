To solve this problem, we need to calculate the prior odds, likelihood ratio, and then the posterior odds.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Likelihood ratio:
Let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio L(A/B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1 or simply 8.
