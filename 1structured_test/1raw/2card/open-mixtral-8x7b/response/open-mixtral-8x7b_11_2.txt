To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks are equally likely to be chosen). So, the prior odds are:

prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then the likelihood of the data under the hypothesis of Deck A divided by the likelihood under the hypothesis of Deck B:

likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

posterior odds = prior odds * likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
