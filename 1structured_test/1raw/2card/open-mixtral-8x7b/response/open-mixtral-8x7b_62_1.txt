To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior odds for drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B are:

P(A): Probability of selecting Deck A = 1/2
P(B): Probability of selecting Deck B = 1/2

P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now we need to find the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood ratio:
Let's assume there are 6N cards in both decks (for simplicity).

In Deck A, there are 4N X's and 2N O's.
In Deck B, there are 2N X's and 4N O's.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4N/6N) * (3N-1/6N-1) * (3N-2/6N-2) * (2N/6N) ≈ 0.02251

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (2N/6N) * (2N-1/6N-1) * (2N-2/6N-2) * (4N/6N) ≈ 0.00278

Likelihood ratio: P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) ≈ 8.104

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8.104 ≈ 8.104

{odds: 8.104}
