To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Let's assume that both decks have an equal chance of being selected, so the prior odds are:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now let's find the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

LR = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 12 = 27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1/2) * 27 = 13.5

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 13.5.

Final answer: {odds: 13.5}
