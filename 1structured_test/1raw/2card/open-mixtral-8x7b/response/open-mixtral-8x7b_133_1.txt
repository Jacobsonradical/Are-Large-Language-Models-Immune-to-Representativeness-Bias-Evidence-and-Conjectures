To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the prior odds as O(A) / O(B), where O(A) and O(B) are the odds of selecting decks A and B, respectively. Since we have no prior preference for either deck, we can assume that O(A) = O(B) = 1, so the prior odds are 1:1.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've chosen decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B))
= (1:1) * (8/27 / 2/243)
= 8:1

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
