To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds, likelihood ratio, and then multiply them together.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks separately, and then divide them.

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3) = 8/27

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) * (2/3)² = 8/27

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 8/27 = 1

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 1 = 1

The posterior odds are 1, meaning there is no significant difference in probability that the 4 cards came from Deck A or Deck B, even though Deck A is more likely to have more X's. This is because the observed outcome (3 X's and 1 O) has the same probability in both decks.
