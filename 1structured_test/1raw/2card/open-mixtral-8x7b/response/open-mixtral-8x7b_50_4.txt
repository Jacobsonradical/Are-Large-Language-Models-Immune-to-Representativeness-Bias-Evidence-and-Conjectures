To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, and event B is drawing 3 X's and 1 O. We want to find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A|B) / P(B|A')

where A' denotes the complement of event A (drawing the 4 cards from Deck B). We can compute the individual terms as follows:

P(B|A) = (2/3 choose 3) * (1/3) = 10 / 27
P(B|A') = (1/3 choose 3) * (2/3) = 2 / 27
P(A) = P(A') = 1/2

Plugging these into the formula, we get:

Posterior Odds = (10/27) / (2/27) * (1/2) / (1/2) = 10 / 2 = 5

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 5:1.
