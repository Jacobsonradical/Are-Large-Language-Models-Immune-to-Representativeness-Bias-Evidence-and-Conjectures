To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/81 / 2/81 = 16/2 = 8

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

{odds: 8}
