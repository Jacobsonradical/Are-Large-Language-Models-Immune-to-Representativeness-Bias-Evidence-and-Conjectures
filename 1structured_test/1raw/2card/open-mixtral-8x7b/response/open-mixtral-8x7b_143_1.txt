To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B. Since the selection is made by chance, both decks have an equal probability of being chosen, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Now we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. Since we know that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we can calculate the probability of this happening given that the cards are drawn from Deck A and Deck B separately.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these probabilities:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * (324 / 4) = 81

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 81.

Answer: {odds: 81}
