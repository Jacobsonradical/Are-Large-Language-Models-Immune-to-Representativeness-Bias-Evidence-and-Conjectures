To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of choosing deck A as A, and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as X. We want to find the posterior odds of A given X.

First, we need to find the prior probability of choosing deck A, which is 1/2 since the two decks are equally likely to be chosen. Similarly, the prior probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is given by the combination formula:

P(X|A) = C(2/3 * total cards in deck A, 3) * C(1/3 * total cards in deck A, 1)

Similarly, the prior probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(X|B) = C(1/3 * total cards in deck B, 3) * C(2/3 * total cards in deck B, 1)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of choosing deck A given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|X) = (C(2/3 * 2n, 3) * C(1/3 * 2n, 1)) / ((C(2/3 * 2n, 3) * C(1/3 * 2n, 1)) + (C(1/3 * 2n, 3) * C(2/3 * 2n, 1)))

where n is the number of cards in each deck.

Since the question asks for the posterior odds, we can simplify the expression by finding the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

posterior odds = (C(2/3 * 2n, 3) * C(1/3 * 2n, 1)) / (C(1/3 * 2n, 3) * C(2/3 * 2n, 1))

For large decks, we can approximate the combinations as follows:

C(m, k) ≈ m^k / k!

Plugging this back into the equation, we get:

posterior odds ≈ ( (2/3 * 2n)^3 / 3!) * ( (1/3 * 2n) / 1) / ( (1/3 * 2n)^3 / 3!) * ( (2/3 * 2n) / 1)

Simplifying, we get:

posterior odds ≈ ( (2/3)^3 / 3!) * ( (1/3) / 1) / ( (1/3)^3 / 3!) * ( (2/3) / 1)

Plugging in the values, we get:

posterior odds ≈ 2

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from deck A are approximately 2:1, compared to deck B.
