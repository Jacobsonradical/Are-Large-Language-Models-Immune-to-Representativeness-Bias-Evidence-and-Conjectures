To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before looking at the cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio for the given information. We are told that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 108 = 3 : 1

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1 : 1) * (3 : 1) = 3 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 3 : 1 compared to Deck B.
