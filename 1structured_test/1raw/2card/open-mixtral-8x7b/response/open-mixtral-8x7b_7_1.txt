To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Before drawing any cards, both decks are equally likely, so the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = L(A) / L(B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 6

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 * 324) / 6

{odds: 54}

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 54:6 or simply 54.
