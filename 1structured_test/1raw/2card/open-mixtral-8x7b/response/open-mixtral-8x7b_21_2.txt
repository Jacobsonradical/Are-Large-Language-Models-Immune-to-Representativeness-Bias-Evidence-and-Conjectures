To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O if we drew 4 cards from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Where N is the total number of cards in each deck. Since the decks are very large, we can approximate the likelihood ratio without N:

LR = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = 54

Posterior odds: Finally, we can find the posterior odds using the formula:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 54 = 54

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 54:1.

{odds: 54}
