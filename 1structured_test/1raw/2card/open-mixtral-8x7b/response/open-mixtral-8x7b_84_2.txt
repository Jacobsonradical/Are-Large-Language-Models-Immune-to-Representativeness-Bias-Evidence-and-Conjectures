To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the prior probabilities and likelihoods.

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since either deck A or deck B could have been chosen)

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27 (the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243 (the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Since P(A) = P(B), this simplifies to:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

Substitute the likelihoods:

8/27 / (2/243) = (8 * 243) / 27 = 648 / 27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 648/1}
