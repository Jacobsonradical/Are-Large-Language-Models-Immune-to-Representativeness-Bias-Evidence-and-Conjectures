To solve this problem, we can use the Bayes' theorem. Let's first calculate the prior probabilities and then the likelihoods. The posterior odds can be found by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds.

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: P(A) = 1/2
- Probability of selecting Deck B: P(B) = 1/2

2. Calculate the likelihoods:
- Given Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a sample of 4 cards is:
  L(A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

- Given Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in a sample of 4 cards is:
  L(B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

3. Calculate the likelihood ratio:
  LR = L(A) / L(B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

4. Calculate the prior odds:
  Odds(A:B) = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

5. Calculate the posterior odds:
  Posterior_Odds(A:B) = Prior_Odds * LR = (1/2) * 8 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are {odds: 4}.
