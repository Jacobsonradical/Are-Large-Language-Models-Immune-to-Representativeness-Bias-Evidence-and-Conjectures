To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before drawing the cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've chosen Deck A or Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Where N is the total number of cards in the deck, and C(a, b) is the number of combinations of choosing b items from a set.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = [P(3X, 1O | A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B)]

To find the posterior odds, multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * LR

You didn't provide the number of cards in the deck. If you provide N, I'll be able to calculate the likelihood ratio and the posterior odds.
