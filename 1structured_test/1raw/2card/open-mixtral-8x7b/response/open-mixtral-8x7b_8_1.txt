To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. 

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks are very large and the selection is random). So, the prior odds are:

prior_odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:

likelihood_ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

posterior_odds = prior_odds * likelihood_ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1 or simply 4.
