To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Since both decks are very large, we can assume that the probability of selecting either deck is equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
So, the prior odds are:
{odds: 1}

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
Likelihood(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)
Likelihood(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
Likelihood(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)

Given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, the likelihood of this outcome is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/2 = 4

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
