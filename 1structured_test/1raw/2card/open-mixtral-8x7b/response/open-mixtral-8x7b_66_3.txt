To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O without knowing the deck's composition is:
P(A) = 1/2

The probability of choosing Deck B and drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(B) = 0

So the prior odds are:
Odds(A:B) = P(A)/P(B) = 1/0 = undefined (but we can assume it's much larger than 1 since the probability of choosing Deck B and drawing this way is negligible)

Likelihood ratio: Let LR be the likelihood ratio.

LR = P(drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

So the likelihood ratio is:
LR = (8/27) / (2/243) = 8/27 * 121.5 = 324.8

Finally, the posterior odds are:
Odds(A:B|3X, 1O) = Odds(A:B) * LR = undefined * 324.8 â‰ˆ 324.8

So, the posterior odds strongly favor Deck A being the deck from which the 4 cards were drawn.

{odds: 324.8}
