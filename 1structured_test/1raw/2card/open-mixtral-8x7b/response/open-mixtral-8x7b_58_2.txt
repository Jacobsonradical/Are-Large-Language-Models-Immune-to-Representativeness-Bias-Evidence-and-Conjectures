To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the selection of a deck and the observation of 3 X's and 1 O in the sample. Let A and B represent the events that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B. We can use the hypergeometric distribution to find these probabilities.

P(3X,1O|Deck A) = H(3; 2/3, 1/3, 4) = 4! / (3! * 1!) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.278

P(3X,1O|Deck B) = H(3; 1/3, 2/3, 4) = 4! / (3! * 1!) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.164

Next, we'll calculate the marginal likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O by summing the probabilities of this observation for both decks:

P(3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X,1O|Deck B) * P(Deck B)

We don't have information about the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, so we'll assume that they are equal, i.e., P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O) = 0.278 * 1/2 + 0.164 * 1/2 ≈ 0.221

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A|3X,1O) / P(Deck B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

Posterior odds = P(3X,1O|Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3X,1O|Deck B) * P(Deck B)

Substituting the calculated probabilities:

Posterior odds = (0.278 * 1/2) / (0.164 * 1/2) ≈ 1.70

{odds: 1.70}
