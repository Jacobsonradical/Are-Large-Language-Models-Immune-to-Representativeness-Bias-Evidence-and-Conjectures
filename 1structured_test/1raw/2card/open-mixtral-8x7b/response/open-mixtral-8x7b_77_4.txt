To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
Since there are two decks, the prior odds can be calculated as:
P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Likelihood ratio (LR+):
Let's denote the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(L|A), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as P(L|B).

P(L|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

P(L|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is calculated as:
LR+ = P(L|A) / P(L|B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds as:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR+ = 1 * 8 = 8

The posterior odds are 8 in favor of the 4 cards having been drawn from Deck A.

{odds: 8}
