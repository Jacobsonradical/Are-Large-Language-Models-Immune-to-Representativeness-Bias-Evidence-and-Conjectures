To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event of choosing Deck A and B be the event of choosing Deck B. We want to find the odds of A and B given that we have drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B, which we will assume are equal (both decks have an equal chance of being chosen). So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have chosen Deck A or Deck B.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 2/27

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) × P(A) / [P(3X, 1O|A) × P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) × P(B)]

P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) × P(B) / [P(3X, 1O|A) × P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) × P(B)]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/27) × (1/2) / (2/27) × (1/2) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

In the requested format:

{odds: 4}
