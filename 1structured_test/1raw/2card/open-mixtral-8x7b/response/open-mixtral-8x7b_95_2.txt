To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B before drawing any cards is 1:1 or 1/1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B separately.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/1) * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1. This means that, given the information about drawing 3 X's and 1 O, it is 8 times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B.
