To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each deck.

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks are selected by chance)

Likelihoods:
For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27
For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) \* P(A) / P(X=3, O=1)
P(B|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|B) \* P(B) / P(X=3, O=1)

The evidence P(X=3, O=1) is the same for both decks, so it cancels out:
Posterior odds = P(X=3, O=1|A) / P(X=3, O=1|B)

Substituting the likelihoods:
Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) = 8 / 2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
