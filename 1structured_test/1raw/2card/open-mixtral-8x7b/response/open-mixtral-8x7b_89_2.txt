To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event (in this case, the deck being A or B) are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities for drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. We know that Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, while Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's.

P(A) = probability of selecting Deck A = 1/2
P(B) = probability of selecting Deck B = 1/2

P(3X, 1O|A) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
= (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × C(12, 3)
= 220 × (2/3)^3 × (1/3) ≈ 154.00

P(3X, 1O|B) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
= (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × C(24, 3)
= 2044 × (1/3)^3 × (2/3) ≈ 171.52

Now, let's calculate the prior odds:

Prior Odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 ≈ 0.50

Next, we will compute the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O under the two hypotheses:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) ≈ 154.00 / 171.52 ≈ 0.90

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ 0.50 × 0.90 ≈ 0.45

{odds: 0.45}
