To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then multiply them together to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote the prior probability of drawing 4 cards from deck A as P(A) and the prior probability of drawing 4 cards from deck B as P(B). Similarly, let's denote the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as L(A) and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as L(B).

Since the decks are very large, the probabilities of drawing any particular card from either deck are not affected by the composition of the other cards in the deck. Therefore, we can calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck as follows:

P(X) = 2/3 for deck A and 1/3 for deck B
P(O) = 1/3 for deck A and 2/3 for deck B

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27

The prior odds of drawing 4 cards from deck A compared to deck B are:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/1 = 1

The likelihood ratio is:

LR = L(A)/L(B) = (8/27)/(2/27) = 4

The posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from deck A compared to deck B are:

PO = P(A)/P(B) \* LR = 1 \* 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to deck B, where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
