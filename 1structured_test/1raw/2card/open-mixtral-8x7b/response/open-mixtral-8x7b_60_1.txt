To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, given that the probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3 and the probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3.

Likelihood(A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27
Likelihood(B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Posterior odds:
We can now calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 : 1 * 8/2 = 4 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, are 4 : 1.
