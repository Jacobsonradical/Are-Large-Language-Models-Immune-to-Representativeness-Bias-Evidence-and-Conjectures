To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks were selected by chance). So, the prior odds are:

prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, given that we've drawn from Deck A and given that we've drawn from Deck B.

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27 
(since there are 4! ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards, and 3! ways to choose 3 X's from the 3 X's)

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 4/81

The likelihood ratio is then:

likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = 8/27 × 81/4 = 64/1

Finally, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds:

posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio = 1 × 64/1 = 64

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, is 64 compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O.
