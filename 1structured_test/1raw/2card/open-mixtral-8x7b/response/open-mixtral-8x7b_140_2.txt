To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then multiply them together to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B) and the likelihood ratio as L(X:O).

Prior odds:
Since there are two decks, the prior odds are simply 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio:
Let's consider the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P(X|A)) and Deck B (P(X|B)) given that there are 2/3X and 1/3O in Deck A and 1/3X and 2/3O in Deck B.

P(X|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
P(X|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio L(X:O) = P(X|A) / P(X|B) = 16/2 = 8

Posterior odds:
O(A:B) * L(X:O) = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1 or simply 8.

Answer: {odds: 8}
