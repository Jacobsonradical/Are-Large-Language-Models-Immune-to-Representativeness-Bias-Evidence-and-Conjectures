To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods involved.

The prior probabilities are:
- P(Deck A) = 1/2 (since we chose either Deck A or Deck B with equal probability)
- P(Deck B) = 1/2

The likelihoods, given that we have 3 X's and 1 O, are:
- P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior Odds = (P(Deck A) * P(3X, 1O | Deck A)) / (P(Deck B) * P(3X, 1O | Deck B))
= (1/2 * 8/27) / (1/2 * 2/243)
= 108/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 108:2 or, in decimal form, approximately 54:1.
