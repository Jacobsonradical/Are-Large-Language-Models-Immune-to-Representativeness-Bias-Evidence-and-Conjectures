To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in favor of B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A and Deck B. The probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck A is equal to the probability of drawing 4 cards from Deck B, since both decks are very large, so the prior odds are 1:1.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. In Deck A, there are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1. In Deck B, there are 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = P(X,O|A) \* P(A) / P(X,O|B) \* P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 1 / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 1

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = 8 / 1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
