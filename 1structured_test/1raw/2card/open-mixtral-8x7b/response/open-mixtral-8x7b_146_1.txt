To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods involved.

Prior probabilities:

* The probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2 and Deck B is 1/2.

Likelihoods:

* The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
  * P(3X, 1O in A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* C(4, 3), where C(4, 3) is the number of combinations of choosing 3 items from 4.
* The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:
  * P(3X, 1O in B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* C(4, 3).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

* P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O in A) \* P(A) / [P(3X, 1O in A) \* P(A) + P(3X, 1O in B) \* P(B)]
* P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O in B) \* P(B) / [P(3X, 1O in A) \* P(A) + P(3X, 1O in B) \* P(B)]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

* Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

The calculation yields:

{odds: 8/1}
