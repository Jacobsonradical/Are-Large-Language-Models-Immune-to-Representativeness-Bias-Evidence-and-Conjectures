To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since both decks are very large, we can assume that the probability of selecting either deck is equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

So, the prior odds are:
{odds: 1/2}

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood(A) = P(3 X and 1 O | Deck A) = C(2/3 * 4, 3) * C(1/3 * 4, 1) / C(4, 4)
             ≈ 0.333

Likelihood(B) = P(3 X and 1 O | Deck B) = C(1/3 * 4, 3) * C(2/3 * 4, 1) / C(4, 4)
             ≈ 0.069

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) ≈ 4.812

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
               = (1/2) * 4.812
               ≈ 2.406

{odds: 2.406}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 2.406.
