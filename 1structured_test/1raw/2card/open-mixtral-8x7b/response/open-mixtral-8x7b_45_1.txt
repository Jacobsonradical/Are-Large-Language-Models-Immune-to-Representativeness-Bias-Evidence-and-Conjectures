To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the prior probability of selecting Deck A as PA and the prior probability of selecting Deck B as PB. The probability of drawing three X's and one O from Deck A is denoted as P(E|A) and the probability of drawing three X's and one O from Deck B is denoted as P(E|B). We want to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A, given the evidence E (three X's and one O):

PA / PB = (P(E|A) * PA) / (P(E|B) * PB)

We can simplify the expression by assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, i.e., PA = PB. We can remove the common factor PA/PB to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A:

Posterior Odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities P(E|A) and P(E|B). Denote the size of each deck as n (n is a large number):

P(E|A) = (Number of ways to draw three X's and one O from Deck A) / (Number of ways to draw any four cards from Deck A)
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)) / (n*n*n*n)
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (n-3)/n
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) - (1/3)^4

Similarly,

P(E|B) = (Number of ways to draw three X's and one O from Deck B) / (Number of ways to draw any four cards from Deck B)
= (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)) / (n*n*n*n)
= (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (n-3)/n
= (1/3)^3 * (2/3) - (1/3)^4

Now, we can find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A:

Posterior Odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B)
= ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) - (1/3)^4) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) - (1/3)^4)
= (14/27) / (2/27)
= 14 / 2
= 7

Hence, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are 7:2, compared to Deck B. In the given format:

{odds: 7/2}
