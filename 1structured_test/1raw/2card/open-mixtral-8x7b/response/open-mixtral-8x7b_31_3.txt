To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each deck.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: 0.5
- Probability of selecting Deck B: 0.5

Likelihoods:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.2963
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0278

Now we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Probability of selecting Deck A * Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of selecting Deck B * Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = (0.5 * 0.2963) / (0.5 * 0.0278) ≈ 5.15

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 5.15.
