To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities of selecting either Deck A or Deck B. Since we chose randomly, the prior probabilities are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Next, let's compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A (LA). We know that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O:

LA = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Now, let's compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck B (LB). We know that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O:

LB = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now we can compute the likelihood ratio (LR) as LA/LB:

LR = LA/LB = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we can compute the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A versus Deck B using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * LR = (1/2) * 8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A are 4.
