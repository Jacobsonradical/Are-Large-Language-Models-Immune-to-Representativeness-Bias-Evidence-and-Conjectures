To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
Since there are two decks, the prior odds are simply the probability of selecting Deck A. We assume that decks are equally likely to be chosen, so the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio for having drawn 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
There are 2/3 probability of drawing an X and 1/3 probability of drawing an O. We need to find the probability of this configuration occurring in a sequence of 4 draws:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X and an O from Deck B is 1/3 for each. We need to find the probability of this configuration occurring in a sequence of 4 draws:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12/1

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (12/1) = 12/1

Our answer is:
{odds: 12}
