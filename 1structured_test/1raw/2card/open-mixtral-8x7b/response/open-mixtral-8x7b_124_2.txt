To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "drawing 4 cards from Deck A" and "drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O".

Let A be the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck A, and B be the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, regardless of the deck.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 1/2 (since there are two decks)
P(X|A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 2/3 of the deck) / (number of ways to choose 4 cards from 2/3 of the deck)
= (2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3 * 4!) / ((2/3)^4 * 16!)
= 28 / (8^4)

P(X|B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from 1/3 of the deck) / (number of ways to choose 4 cards from 1/3 of the deck)
= (1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 4!) / ((1/3)^4 * 6!)
= 20 / (3^4)

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X), which is equal to P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B) by Bayes' theorem.

P(X|A) * P(A) = (28 / (8^4)) * (1/2)
P(X|B) * P(B) = (20 / (3^4)) * (1/2)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
{odds: (28 / (8^4)) / (20 / (3^4))}

Or approximately 0.2929 (to 4 decimal places). This means that, given the information about the 4 cards, it is slightly more likely that they were drawn from Deck B than from Deck A.
