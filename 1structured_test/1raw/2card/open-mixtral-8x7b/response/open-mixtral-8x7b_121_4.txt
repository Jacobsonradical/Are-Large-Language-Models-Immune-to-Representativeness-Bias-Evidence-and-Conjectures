To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B before drawing any cards is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/81 * 81/2 = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we can determine the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A are 8:1 compared to Deck B.
