To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck A and B be the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in favor of B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

First, we need to find the prior odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A versus drawing 4 cards from Deck B, regardless of the marked cards. Since the decks are very large, the probability of selecting either deck is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A and Deck B.

Let P(X|A) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck A, and P(O|A) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck A. Similarly, let P(X|B) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck B, and P(O|B) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck B.

P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3, P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

Now, let's find the likelihoods. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)^1

To find the posterior odds, we need to multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
= 1 * (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))
= (P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A)^1) / (P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B)^1)
= ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ) / ( (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 )
= 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, are 8:1 in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B.
