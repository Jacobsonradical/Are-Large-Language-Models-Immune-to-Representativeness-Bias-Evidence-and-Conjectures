To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define our prior probabilities and evidence.

Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to the same from Deck B:

P(A)/P(B) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 8/2 = 4:1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that the deck has the stated proportions of X's and O's.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(A) / P(B)

Substituting in the values we calculated above, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = (8/27) / (2/27) \* 4/1 = 16:1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 16:1, compared to Deck B.
