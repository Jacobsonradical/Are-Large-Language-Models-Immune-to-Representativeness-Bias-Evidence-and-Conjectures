To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (1/2) since the deck was selected by chance. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, given that this particular arrangement occurred.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is thus:

16/81 / 2/81 = 16/2 = 8

The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, so in this case, they are:

{odds: 1/2 * 8} = {odds: 4}
