To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio:
We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, respectively.

For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X):
P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
P(3 X's and 1 O) = P(XXXO) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X):
P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
P(3 X's and 1 O) = P(XXXO) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio: P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 12

{odds: 12}
