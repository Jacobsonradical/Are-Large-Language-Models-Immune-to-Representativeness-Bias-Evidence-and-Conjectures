To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've selected Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 12

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 : 1) * (324 : 12) = 324 : 12

As a single number, the posterior odds are 324/12 or 27:1.
