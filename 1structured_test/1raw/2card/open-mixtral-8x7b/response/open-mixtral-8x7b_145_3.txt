To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A, the probability is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
For Deck B, the probability is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81.

So, the likelihood ratio is:

L(A|XOO) / L(B|XOO) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1 : 1) * 12
Posterior odds = 12 : 1

{odds: 12}
