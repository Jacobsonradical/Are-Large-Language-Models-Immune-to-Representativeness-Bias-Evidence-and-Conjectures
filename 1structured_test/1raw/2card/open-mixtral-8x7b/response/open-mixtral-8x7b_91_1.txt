To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of choosing Deck A as A and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as XO. We are interested in finding the posterior odds of A given XO, which can be written as:

P(A|XO) / P(B|XO) = P(XO|A) * P(A) / P(XO)

We are given that the probability of choosing Deck A is the same as choosing Deck B, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(XO|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(XO|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

We can now find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either deck as:

P(XO) = P(XO|A) * P(A) + P(XO|B) * P(B)
= (8/27)*(1/2) + (2/27)*(1/2)
= 5/27

We can now calculate the posterior odds as:

odds = P(A|XO) / P(B|XO)
= P(XO|A) * P(A) / P(XO)
= (8/27)*(1/2) / (5/27)
= 8/5

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, is 8:5.
