To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Likelihood ratio:
We want to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, given their compositions.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 1352 (combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from 1352 cards)

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 2704 (combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from 2704 cards)

The likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 1352 / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 2704) ≈ 0.467

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 0.467 ≈ 0.467

Answer: {odds: 0.467}
