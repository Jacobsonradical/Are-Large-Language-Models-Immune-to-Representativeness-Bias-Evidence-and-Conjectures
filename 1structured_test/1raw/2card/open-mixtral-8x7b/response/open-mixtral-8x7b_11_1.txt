To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Likelihood ratio:
Let's denote the probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A as P(X|A) = 2/3 and the probability of drawing a card marked O from Deck A as P(O|A) = 1/3. Similarly, for Deck B, P(X|B) = 1/3 and P(O|B) = 2/3.

The likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is:
L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is:
L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = L(A) / L(B) = 8/2 = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 or simply 4.
