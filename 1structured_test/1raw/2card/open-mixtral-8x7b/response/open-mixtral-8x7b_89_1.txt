To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event of drawing from deck A and B be the event of drawing from deck B. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 since the deck is chosen randomly. We want to find the posterior odds of A given XXXO, which we denote as P(A|XXXO). By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO)

First, let's find P(XXXO|A). Since 2/3 of the cards in deck A are marked X, the probability of drawing an X from deck A is 2/3. Similarly, the probability of drawing an O from deck A is 1/3. Since we are drawing 4 cards, we have:

P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/81

Now, let's find P(XXXO|B). Since only 1/3 of the cards in deck B are marked X, the probability of drawing an X from deck B is 1/3. Similarly, the probability of drawing an O from deck B is 2/3. We have:
