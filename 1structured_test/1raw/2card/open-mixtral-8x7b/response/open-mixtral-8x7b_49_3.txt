To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio. In this case, the event is drawing 4 cards from either Deck A or Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's first calculate the prior probabilities. Since we picked a deck randomly, the probability of picking Deck A is the same as picking Deck B, which is 1/2 for both.

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 4 = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2:1.
