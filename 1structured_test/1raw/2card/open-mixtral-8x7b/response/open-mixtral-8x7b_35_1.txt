To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event (in this case, drawing from deck A) are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

First, let's calculate the prior odds of selecting deck A. Since there are only two decks, the prior odds are simply 1:1, or 1.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's. This simplifies to:

Likelihood(A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) / ([2/3 + 1/3] ^ 4) = 16/81

Similarly, we can calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from a deck of 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's, divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's. This simplifies to:

Likelihood(B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) / ([1/3 + 2/3] ^ 4) = 8/243

The likelihood ratio is then the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:

Likelihood Ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = 16/81 / 8/243 = 54/9

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * 54/9 = 6

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 6:1.
