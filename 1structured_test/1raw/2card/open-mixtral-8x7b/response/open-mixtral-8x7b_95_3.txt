To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A is equal to the probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2 or 0.5. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio for each deck given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 2/81

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Finally, the posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 12 = 12

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 12.
