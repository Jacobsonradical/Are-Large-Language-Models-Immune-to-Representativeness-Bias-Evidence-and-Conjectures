To find the answer, we first need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the two decks given the observed evidence (3 X's and 1 O). The prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, so they are both 1/2. Let's calculate the likelihoods for each deck.

Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 8/81

Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
= (8/81) * (1/2) / [(8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2)]
= 8/10

P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
= (2/81) * (1/2) / [(8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2)]
= 2/10

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
= (8/10) / (2/10)
= 4

So, the posterior odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
