To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "selecting deck A" and "selecting deck B", and we want to find the probability of each given that we have observed 3 X's and 1 O in a sample of 4 cards.

Let A and B represent the events of selecting deck A and deck B, respectively, and let X and O represent the events of drawing an X or an O, respectively. Then we want to find the posterior odds of A and B given XOXX (i.e., 3 X's and 1 O).

To do this, we first need to find the prior probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B, which we will denote as P(A) and P(B), respectively. Since the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, which we will denote as P(XOXX | A) and P(XOXX | B), respectively. Since 2/3 of the cards in deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we have:

P(XOXX | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/81

Similarly, since 1/3 of the cards in deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we have:

P(XOXX | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B given XOXX:

P(A | XOXX) = P(XOXX | A) \* P(A) / P(XOXX)
P(B | XOXX) = P(XOXX | B) \* P(B) / P(XOXX)

where P(XOXX) is the total probability of observing XOXX, which can be calculated as:

P(XOXX) = P(XOXX | A) \* P(A) + P(XOXX | B) \* P(B)

Plugging in the values we have calculated, we get:

P(XOXX) = (8/81) \* (1/2) + (2/243) \* (1/2) = 10/486

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A | XOXX) = (8/81) \* (1/2) / (10/486) = 24/50
P(B | XOXX) = (2/243) \* (1/2) / (10/486) = 1/50

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds of A and B given XOXX as:

Odds(A : B | XOXX) = P(A | XOXX) / P(B | XOXX) = 24/1 = 24

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 24 to 1, compared to Deck B.
