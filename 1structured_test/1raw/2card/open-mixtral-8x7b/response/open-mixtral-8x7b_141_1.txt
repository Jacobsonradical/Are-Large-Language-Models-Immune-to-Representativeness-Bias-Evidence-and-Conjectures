To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A, the probability is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
For Deck B, the probability is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:

Likelihood ratio = L(A) / L(B) = 16/81 : 2/81 = 16 : 2 = 8 : 1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 : 1) * (8 : 1) = 8 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 8 : 1.
