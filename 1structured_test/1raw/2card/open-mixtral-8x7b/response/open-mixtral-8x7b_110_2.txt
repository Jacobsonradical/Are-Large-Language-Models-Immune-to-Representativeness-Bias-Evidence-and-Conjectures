To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we assume equal probabilities:
P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:
prior_odds = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards are drawn from Deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards are drawn from Deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, the likelihood ratio LR is:

LR = L(A) / L(B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 729/54

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

posterior_odds = prior_odds * LR = 1 * (729/54) = 13.5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 13.5}
