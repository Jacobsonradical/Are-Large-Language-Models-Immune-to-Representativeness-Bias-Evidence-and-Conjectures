To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Decks A and B. Since there are no preferences given, we assume equal probabilities for both decks, so the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards are from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Likelihood(A) = P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

Similarly,

Likelihood(B) = P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 4/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio

Posterior odds = 1 × (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is:

{odds: 2}
