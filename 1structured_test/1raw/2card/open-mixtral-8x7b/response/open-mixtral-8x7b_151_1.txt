To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 243/3 = 81

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 81 = 81

{odds: 81}
