To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A):P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've selected Deck A, and divide it by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've selected Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3)
P(3X, 1O | A) = 16/81

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)
P(3X, 1O | B) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/27) = 16/3

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1 : 1) * (16/3) = 16/3

{odds: 16/3}
