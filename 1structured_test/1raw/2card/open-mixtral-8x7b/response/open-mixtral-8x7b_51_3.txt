To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B.

Probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(13, 4) = 220 * (8/27) = 644/27

Probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(13, 4) = 220 * (2/27) = 440/27

Likelihood ratio: P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 644/27 * (27/440) = 644/440

Posterior odds: Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 0.5 * (644/440) = 322/440 or approximately 0.732 (rounded to three decimal places).

{odds: 0.732}
