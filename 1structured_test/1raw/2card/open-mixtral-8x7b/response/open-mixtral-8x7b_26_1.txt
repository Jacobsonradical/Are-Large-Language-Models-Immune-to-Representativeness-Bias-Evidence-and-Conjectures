To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, given their compositions.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 16/81 * 81/2 = 16/2 = 8

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

{odds: 8}
