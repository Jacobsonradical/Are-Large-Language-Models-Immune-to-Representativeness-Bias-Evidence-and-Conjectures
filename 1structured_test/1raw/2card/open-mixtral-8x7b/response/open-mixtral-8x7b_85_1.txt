To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are drawing the cards from Deck A or Deck B, and we want to find the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed outcome (3 X's and 1 O). 

Let Odds(A) represent the prior odds of drawing from Deck A, and Odds(B) be the prior odds of drawing from Deck B. We know that Odds(A) = 1 (since neither deck is favored initially).

To calculate the posterior odds, we need to find the likelihood ratio (LR) of the two hypotheses (A and B) given the observed outcome.

Let's first find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (Hypothesis A):

The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. Since we are drawing 4 cards, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Now, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (Hypothesis B):

The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. Since we are drawing 4 cards, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the observed outcome under both hypotheses:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observed outcome:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 27 = 27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 27}.
