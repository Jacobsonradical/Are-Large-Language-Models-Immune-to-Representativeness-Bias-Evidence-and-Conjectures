To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

First, let's compute the prior odds. The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2 for each deck. Therefore, the prior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A, which has 2/3 of the cards marked X and 1/3 marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

L(A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3)

For Deck B, which has 1/3 of the cards marked X and 2/3 marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

L(B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)

Now, compute the likelihood ratio:

LR = L(A)/L(B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Simplify the likelihood ratio:

LR = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4/1 = 4

Finally, calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 or simply 4.
