To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards (i.e., the probability of choosing Deck A by chance). If both decks have the same size, this probability is 1/2.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to drawing the same configuration from Deck B.

Let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We'll denote the size of the deck as n:

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = C(2n/3, 3) * C(n/3, 1) / C(2n, 4)

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = C(n/3, 3) * C(2n/3, 1) / C(2n, 4)

Here, C(a, b) denotes the number of combinations of a items taken b at a time.

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * likelihood ratio

To find the exact value, we need to know the size of the deck (n), but since the question only asks for the odds without specifying the deck size, we can't determine it.

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: cannot be determined without knowing the deck size}
