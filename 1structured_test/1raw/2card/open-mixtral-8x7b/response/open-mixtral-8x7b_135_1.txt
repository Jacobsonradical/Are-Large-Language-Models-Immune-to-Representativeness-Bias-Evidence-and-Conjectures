To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

First, let's compute the prior odds. Since the two decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Next, let's compute the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 \* (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Finally, we can compute the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* LR = 1 \* 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 or simply 4.
