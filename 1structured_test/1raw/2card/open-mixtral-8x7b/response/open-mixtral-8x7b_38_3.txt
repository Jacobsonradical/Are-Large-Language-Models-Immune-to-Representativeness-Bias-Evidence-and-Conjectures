To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then combine them to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A and P(B) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Next, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which we'll denote as P(3X, 1O|A). Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O, we have:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) \* C(24, 4)

where C(24, 4) is the number of combinations of choosing 4 cards from a deck of 24 (the total number of cards in Deck A).

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which we'll denote as P(3X, 1O|B). Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O, we have:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) \* C(36, 4)

where C(36, 4) is the number of combinations of choosing 4 cards from a deck of 36 (the total number of cards in Deck B).

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)
= (2/3)^4 \* C(24, 4) / (1/3)^3 \* C(36, 4)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using the prior odds and likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* LR
= (1/2) \* ((2/3)^4 \* C(24, 4) / (1/3)^3 \* C(36, 4))
= (1/2) \* (2^4 / 3) \* (C(24, 4) / C(36, 4))

Using a calculator, we can find the value of C(24, 4) = 10,628 and C(36, 4) = 376,992. So:

Posterior odds = (1/2) \* (2^4 / 3) \* (10,628 / 376,992)
= 0.182

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O, is approximately 0.182. This is much lower than the prior odds of 1/2, which suggests that the observation of 3 X's and 1 O is evidence against Deck A and in favor of Deck B.
