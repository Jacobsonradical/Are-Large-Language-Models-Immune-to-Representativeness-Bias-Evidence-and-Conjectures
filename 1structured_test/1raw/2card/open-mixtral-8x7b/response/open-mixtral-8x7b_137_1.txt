To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/81 * 81/2 = 16

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 16 = 16

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, is:

{odds: 16}
