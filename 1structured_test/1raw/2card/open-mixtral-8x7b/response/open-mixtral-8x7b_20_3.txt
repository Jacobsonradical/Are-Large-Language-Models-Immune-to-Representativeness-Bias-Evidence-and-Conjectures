To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

P(A)/P(B) = (1/2)^4 / (1/2)^4 = 1

Now we need to compute the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/81 = 12

Finally, the posterior odds are:

posterior odds = prior odds \* likelihood ratio = 1 \* 12 = 12

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 12.

Answer: {odds: 12}
