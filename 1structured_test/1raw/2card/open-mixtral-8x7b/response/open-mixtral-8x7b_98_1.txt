To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The odds of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards drawn are 1:1 since there is no preference for either deck.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B separately.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now calculate the likelihood ratio:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Finally, multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to obtain the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1:1) * 8 = 8:1

So, the posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
