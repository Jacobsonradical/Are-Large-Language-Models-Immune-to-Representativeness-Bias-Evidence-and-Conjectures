To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event (in this case, drawing the 4 cards from Deck A) is equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

First, let's calculate the prior odds. Since the two decks are very large, we can assume that the probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We know that 3 out of the 4 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O. The probability of drawing this configuration from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × (4! / (3! × 1!))

where the term (4! / (3! × 1!)) is a combinatorial factor that accounts for the different ways in which we can draw 3 X's and 1 O.

Similarly, the probability of drawing this configuration from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × (4! / (3! × 1!))

The likelihood ratio is then:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Substituting the expressions we found above, we get:

Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 × (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 × (2/3)]

After simplifying, we get:

Likelihood ratio = 8

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (1/2) × 8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4.
