To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the prior and posterior probabilities of two hypotheses (in this case, decks A and B), based on some observed evidence (the cards drawn).

Let P(A) and P(B) be the prior probabilities that decks A and B were selected, respectively. Let P(X|A) and P(X|B) be the probabilities that a card is marked X, given that it comes from decks A and B, respectively. Similarly, let P(O|A) and P(O|B) be the probabilities that a card is marked O, given that it comes from decks A and B, respectively.

We're given the following information:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since either deck A or B was selected with equal probability)
* P(X|A) = 2/3
* P(X|B) = 1/3
* P(O|A) = 1/3
* P(O|B) = 2/3

Now, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either deck.

For deck A:
- P(3X and 1O from A) = P(X|A)^3 \* P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)

For deck B:
- P(3X and 1O from B) = P(X|B)^3 \* P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the cards were drawn from deck A:

P(A|3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O from A) \* P(A) / (P(3X and 1O from A) \* P(A) + P(3X and 1O from B) \* P(B))

Recall that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, so the above formula simplifies to:

P(A|3X and 1O) = P(3X and 1O from A) / (P(3X and 1O from A) + P(3X and 1O from B))

Now, we just need to plug in the values we calculated earlier:

P(A|3X and 1O) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3) + (1/3)^3 \* (2/3))

Calculating the above expression, we find that:

P(A|3X and 1O) ≈ 0.7407

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds for drawing the cards from deck A versus deck B:

Odds = P(A|3X and 1O) / P(B|3X and 1O) = 0.7407 / (1 - 0.7407) ≈ 2.897

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A are approximately 2.897.

Answer: {odds: 2.897}
