To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The formula is as follows:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

We are given that the two decks are equally likely to be chosen, so the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 4 cards have been drawn.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is then:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 \* 27 = 27

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 27:1 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 27}
