To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which states that the posterior odds for two hypotheses H1 and H2 is equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio. In this case, the prior odds are 1 (since we have no reason to prefer one deck over the other before seeing the cards), and the likelihood ratio can be calculated as follows:

P(3 X's and 1 O's | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27
P(3 X's and 1 O's | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then given by:

LR = P(3 X's and 1 O's | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O's | Deck B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* LR = 1 \* 4 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4. This means that, after seeing the 3 X's and 1 O, it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 4}
