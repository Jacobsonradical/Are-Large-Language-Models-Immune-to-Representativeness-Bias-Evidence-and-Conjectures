To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A before drawing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of choosing Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We need to find the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given that we have chosen Deck A or Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Where N is the total number of cards in the deck (which we assume to be large enough for the probability of drawing any specific card to be small).

Let's simplify the expression by using the following approximations:
C(pN, k) ≈ (pN)^k / k!

Then,

P(3X, 1O | A) ≈ (8/27)^3 * (1/3) / (N^4 / 24)
P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ (1/27)^3 * (2/3) / (N^4 / 24)

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these probabilities:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ (8/27)^3 * (1/3) / (1/27)^3 * (2/3)
LR ≈ 2048:1

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 2048:1 = 2048:1

Hence, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 2048:1.

{odds: 2048}
