To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the selection of Deck A and the observation of the cards drawn.

Let A be the event of selecting Deck A, and B be the event of selecting Deck B. Let X be the observation of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We want to find P(A|X), the probability of selecting Deck A given the observation X.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|X) = P(X|A) \* P(A) / P(X)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck is chosen randomly)
* P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

We also need to find P(X), which is the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either Deck A or Deck B. Since the probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, we can write:

P(X) = P(X|A) \* P(A) + P(X|B) \* P(B) = (8/27)*(1/2) + (2/27)*(1/2) = 5/27

Now we can find the posterior odds:

posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) \* P(A) / P(X) / P(X|B) \* P(B) / P(X)
= (8/27)*(1/2) / (5/27) / (2/27)*(1/2) / (5/27)
= 16/10 = 8/5

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:5.
