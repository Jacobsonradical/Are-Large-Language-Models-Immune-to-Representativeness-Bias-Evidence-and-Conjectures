To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio:
- For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81.
- For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81.

The likelihood ratio is then (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8.

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8.
