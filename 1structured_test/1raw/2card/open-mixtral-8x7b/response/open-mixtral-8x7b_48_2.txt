To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the four cards are drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the four cards are drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A:B given the observation that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
- P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))
= (8/27) * (1/2) / ((8/27) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2))
= 108/111

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / ((8/27) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2))
= (2/243) * (1/2) / ((8/27) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2))
= 3/111

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
= (108/111) / (3/111)
= 36/1

So, the posterior odds of the four cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 36:1.

{odds: 36}
