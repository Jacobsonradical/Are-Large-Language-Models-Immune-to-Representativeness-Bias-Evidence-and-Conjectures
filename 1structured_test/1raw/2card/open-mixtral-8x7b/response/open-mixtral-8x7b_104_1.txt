To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is also 1/2, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: To find the likelihood ratio, we need to calculate the probabilities of observing 3 Xs and 1 O under each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds (A:B) = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 8:1.
