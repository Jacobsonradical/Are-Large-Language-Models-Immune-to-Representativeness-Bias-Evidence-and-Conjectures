To determine the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:
Prior odds = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio for having drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

Likelihood(A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27
Likelihood(B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12/1

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 12/1 = 12

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 12.
