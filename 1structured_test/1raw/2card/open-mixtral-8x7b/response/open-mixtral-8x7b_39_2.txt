To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then multiply these two values together to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B) and the likelihood ratio as LR(X:O). We want to find the posterior odds O(A:B|X:O).

**Step 1: Calculate the prior odds O(A:B)**

The prior probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

The prior odds are then given by:

O(A:B) = P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

**Step 2: Calculate the likelihood ratio LR(X:O)**

To calculate the likelihood ratio, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn from Deck A or Deck B.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. We know there are twice as many X's as O's in Deck A, so the probability of drawing one X and one O is:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3) * (1/3)

Now, since we are drawing 4 cards without replacement, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X,1O|A) = P(X,O|A) * P(X,O,X|A) = (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/2) * (5/8)

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. We know there are twice as many O's as X's in Deck B, so the probability of drawing one X and one O is:

P(X,O|B) = (1/3) * (2/3)

Now, since we are drawing 4 cards without replacement, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X,1O|B) = P(X,O|B) * P(X,O,X|B) = (1/3) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (5/8)

The likelihood ratio is then given by:

LR(X:O) = P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B) = (2/3) * (1/3) * (1/2) * (5/8) / ((1/3) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (5/8)) = 1

**Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds O(A:B|X:O)**

The posterior odds are given by:

O(A:B|X:O) = O(A:B) * LR(X:O) = 1 * 1 = 1

So, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B are 1:1, meaning there is no preference for one deck over the other given the observed data.

**Final answer: {odds: 1}**
