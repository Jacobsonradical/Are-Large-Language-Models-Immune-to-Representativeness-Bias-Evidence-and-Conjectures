To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio. In this case, the prior odds are 1 (since we have no reason to prefer one deck over the other before seeing the drawn cards), and the likelihood ratio can be calculated as follows:

P(3 X and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X and 1 O | Deck B)

First, let's compute the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A. There are a total of 4 cards, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose 3 X's and 1 way to choose 1 O. The probability of this particular configuration is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1. Therefore, the overall probability is:

P(3 X and 1 O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, for Deck B, there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose 1 X and 3 O's, and the probability of this particular configuration is (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3. Therefore, the overall probability is:

P(3 X and 1 O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = (C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / (C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3)

The C(4, 3) terms cancel out, leaving:

Likelihood Ratio = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^3)

Likelihood Ratio = (2/3)^2 / (2/3)^2 = 1

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds, which is 1. Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 1}
