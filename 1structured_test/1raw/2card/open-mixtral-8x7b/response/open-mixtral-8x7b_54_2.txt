To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio:

posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio

In this case, our hypotheses are that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (H1) or Deck B (H2). Since we have no prior preference for either deck, we can assume a prior odds of 1:

prior odds = P(H1) / P(H2) = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:

likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio = 1 × 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:

{odds: 4}
