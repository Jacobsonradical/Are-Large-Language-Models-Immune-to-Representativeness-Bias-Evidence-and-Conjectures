To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
Since there are two decks, the prior odds are simply 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio:
Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now we'll compute the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we'll calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds are 8.

{odds: 8}
