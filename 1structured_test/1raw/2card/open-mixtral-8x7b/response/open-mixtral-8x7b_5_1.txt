To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done randomly, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Let's calculate the probabilities for deck A:
- P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- P(3X, 1O) = choose(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for deck B:
- P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
- P(3X, 1O) = choose(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

So, the likelihood ratio LR = (8/81) / (2/27) = 4/9

Finally, we can compute the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * (4/9) = 4/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4/9.
