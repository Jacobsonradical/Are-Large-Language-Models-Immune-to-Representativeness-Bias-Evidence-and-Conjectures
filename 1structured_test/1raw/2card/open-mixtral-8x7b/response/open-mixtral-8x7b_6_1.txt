To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the posterior odds of the deck being A given that we've drawn 3 X's and 1 O. Let Odds(A) be the prior odds of the deck being A.

Bayes' theorem states:

Posterior Odds(A|X=3, O=1) = Prior Odds(A) * Likelihood Ratio

First, let's compute the Likelihood Ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(X=3, O=1|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(X=3, O=1|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, the Likelihood Ratio is:

Likelihood Ratio = P(X=3, O=1|A) / P(X=3, O=1|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 6

Since the prior odds are Odds(A) = P(A) / P(B), and assuming a 50/50 chance of selecting either deck, the prior odds are 1.

Now, we can compute the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds(A|X=3, O=1) = Prior Odds(A) * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * (324 / 6) = 54

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 54}
