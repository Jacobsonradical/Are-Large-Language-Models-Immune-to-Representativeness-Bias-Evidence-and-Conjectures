To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and B should be equal since we select one of them randomly. So, the prior odds are:
P(A) / P(B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from decks A and B.

For Deck A (with 2/3 X and 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (with 1/3 X and 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Posterior odds:
P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = prior odds * likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

The posterior odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8:1.
