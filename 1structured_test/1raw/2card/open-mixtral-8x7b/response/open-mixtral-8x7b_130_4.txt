To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (both decks are equally likely)

P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1/2

Prior odds = P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio (LR) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 8/2 = 4

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
