To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
- The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2
- Therefore, the prior odds are 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
Likelihood(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)

Likelihood(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
Likelihood(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)

Given that we have 3 X's and 1 O, the likelihood of drawing these cards is:

Likelihood(3X, 1O|A) = (Likelihood(X|A))^3 * (Likelihood(O|A))^1
Likelihood(3X, 1O|B) = (Likelihood(X|B))^3 * (Likelihood(O|B))^1

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(3X, 1O|A) / Likelihood(3X, 1O|B)
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= 8

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * 8
= 8

So, the posterior odds are 8 : 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
