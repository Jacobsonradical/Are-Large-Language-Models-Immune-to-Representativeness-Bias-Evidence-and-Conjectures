To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

In this case, our event A is drawing from deck A, and event B is drawing from deck B. Our observed data X is having 3 Xs and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn.

We're asked to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)

From the problem statement, we know that P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from deck A) and P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from deck B).

Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the numerator and denominator of the posterior odds:

Numerator: P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) = (2/3) * (1/2)
Denominator: P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) = (1/3) * (1/2)

Posterior odds = (2/3) * (1/2) / ((1/3) * (1/2)) = 2/1

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, is 2:1.

Answer: {odds: 2}
