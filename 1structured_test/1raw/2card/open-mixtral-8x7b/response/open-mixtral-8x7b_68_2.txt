To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A is the same as choosing Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 6

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (324 / 6) = 324 / 6 or 54:1

The posterior odds are 54:1, which means that given the information that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, it is 54 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
