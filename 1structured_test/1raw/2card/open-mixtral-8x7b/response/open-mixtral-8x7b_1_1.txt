To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: 1/2
- Probability of selecting Deck B: 1/2

Likelihoods:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 4/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = (Prior probability of Deck A * Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Prior probability of Deck B * Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = (1/2 × 8/27) / (1/2 × 4/81) = 6/2 = 3

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 3:1.

Answer: {odds: 3}
