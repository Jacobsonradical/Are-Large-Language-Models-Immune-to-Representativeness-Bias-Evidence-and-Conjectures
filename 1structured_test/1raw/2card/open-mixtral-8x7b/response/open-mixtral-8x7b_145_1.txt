To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the decks are very large, we can assume that the probability of selecting either deck is equal (0.5).

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

So, the prior odds are:
Prior odds = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio (LR).

LR = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

First, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = (8/27) / (2/27) = 8/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * (8/2) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
