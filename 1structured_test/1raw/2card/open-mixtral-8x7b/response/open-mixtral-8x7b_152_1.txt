To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
- The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (2/243) = 32/3

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (32/3) = 32/3

{odds: 32/3}
