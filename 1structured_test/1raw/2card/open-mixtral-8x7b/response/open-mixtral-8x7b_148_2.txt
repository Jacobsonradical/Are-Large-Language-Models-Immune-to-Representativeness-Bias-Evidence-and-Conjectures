To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. The prior odds are then:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
Let's find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3) = 16/81

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio:
L(A, B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is 8.

{odds: 8}
