To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio for the observed event (3 X's and 1 O).

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3 * 52, 3) * C(1/3 * 52, 1) / C(52, 4) = (22100 / 270725) ≈ 0.0816

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1) / C(52, 4) = (22100 / 1192052) ≈ 0.0185

The likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 0.0816 / 0.0185 ≈ 4.41

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4.41 ≈ 4.41

{odds: 4.41}
