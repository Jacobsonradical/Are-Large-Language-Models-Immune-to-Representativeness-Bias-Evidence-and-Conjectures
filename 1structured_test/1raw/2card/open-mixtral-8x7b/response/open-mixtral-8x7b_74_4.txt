To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen)

Prior odds for Deck B:
P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/27) = 16/3

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds (A) = (1/2) * (16/3) = 8/3

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are 8:3 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 8/3}
