To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: 1/2
- Probability of selecting Deck B: 1/2

Likelihoods:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior Odds (A/B) = Prior Odds (A/B) * Likelihood Ratio (A/B)

Prior Odds (A/B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood Ratio (A/B) = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Therefore,

Posterior Odds (A/B) = 1 * 4 = 4

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4.
