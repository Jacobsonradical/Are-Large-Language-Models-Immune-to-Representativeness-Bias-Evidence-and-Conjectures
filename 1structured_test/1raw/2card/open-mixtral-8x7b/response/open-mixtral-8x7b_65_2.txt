To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods involved.

Let's denote the prior probability that Deck A is selected as PA, and the prior probability that Deck B is selected as PB. We are not given these probabilities, but we can assume that they are equal, i.e., PA = PB = 0.5 since there is no reason to prefer one deck over the other.

Next, let's denote the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as LA, and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B as LB.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

LA = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

LB = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

To find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we need to calculate the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

posterior odds = P(A|X=3,O=1) / P(B|X=3,O=1)

By Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|X=3,O=1) = PA \* LA / (PA \* LA + PB \* LB)
P(B|X=3,O=1) = PB \* LB / (PA \* LA + PB \* LB)

Since we assume PA = PB, this simplifies to:

P(A|X=3,O=1) = LA / (LA + LB)
P(B|X=3,O=1) = LB / (LA + LB)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

posterior odds = LA / LB = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, is 8 to 1 compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O. In other words, it is 8 times more likely that the 4 cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed outcome of 3 X's and 1 O.

Answer: {odds: 8}
