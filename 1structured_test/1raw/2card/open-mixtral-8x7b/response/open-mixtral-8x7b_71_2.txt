To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are drawing 4 cards from either Deck A or Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let A and B be the events that 4 cards are drawn from Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Let X and O be the events that 3 and 1 cards are marked X and O, respectively. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X,O)/P(B|X,O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X,O) = P(X,O|A) \* P(A) / P(X,O)

P(B|X,O) = P(X,O|B) \* P(B) / P(X,O)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the decks are equally likely to be selected. Therefore, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability P(X,O) is the same for both decks and can be calculated as follows:

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

where C(n, r) is the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

Therefore, P(X,O) = [C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1) + C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1)] / C(52, 4)

The probability P(X,O|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which is:

P(X,O|A) = C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

Similarly, the probability P(X,O|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which is:

P(X,O|B) = C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

Substituting these probabilities into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|X,O) = P(X,O|A) \* P(A) / P(X,O)
= [C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1)] / [C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1) + C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1)]

P(B|X,O) = P(X,O|B) \* P(B) / P(X,O)
= [C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1)] / [C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1) + C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1)]

The posterior odds P(A|X,O)/P(B|X,O) are therefore:

{odds: [C(2/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(1/3 \* 52, 1)] / [C(1/3 \* 52, 3) \* C(2/3 \* 52, 1)]}

Using a calculator, we get:

{odds: 2.2744}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 2.2744 to 1.
