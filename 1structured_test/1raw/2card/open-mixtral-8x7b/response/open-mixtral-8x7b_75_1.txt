To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B before seeing any cards. We have no reason to prefer one deck over the other, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that we have already drawn 4 cards.

Let's calculate the likelihoods:

- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81
- Likelihood ratio = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds: 1 * 8 = 8

In the format you requested, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
