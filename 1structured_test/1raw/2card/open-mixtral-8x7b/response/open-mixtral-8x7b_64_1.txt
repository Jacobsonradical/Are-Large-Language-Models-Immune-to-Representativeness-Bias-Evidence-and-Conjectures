To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let A and B be the events of selecting Decks A and B, respectively, and let X3O1 be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O. Then we want to calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this ratio as:

P(X3O1|A) * P(A) / P(X3O1|B) * P(B)

First, let's find the prior probabilities of selecting Decks A and B. Assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Next, we need the conditional probabilities P(X3O1|A) and P(X3O1|B). This will require calculating the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given the card distributions in Decks A and B.

Let's start with Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X3O1|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, for Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(X3O1|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (8/27) * (1/2) / (2/27) * (1/2) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, is 4:1 or simply 4.
