To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the observed evidence that 3 out of 4 cards are marked X. We need to find the prior probability P(A), the likelihood P(B|A), and the likelihood P(B|~A).

1. Prior probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen)

2. Likelihoods:
P(B|A) = P(3 X's and 1 O given Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(B|~A) = P(3 X's and 1 O given Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = (8/27) * (1/2) / [((8/27) * (1/2)) + ((2/243) * (1/2))]

Simplify:

P(A|B) = 8/29

The posterior odds are 8:21, so the odds favor Deck A, given the observed evidence.

{odds: 8/21}
