To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are selecting Deck A or B and drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck. Let's denote the selection of Deck A as event A and the selection of Deck B as event B. We want to find the posterior odds of A/B after observing the specific card drawing.

Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)

where
- P(A|X) is the probability of event A given the observation X (posterior probability)
- P(X|A) is the probability of the observation X given event A (likelihood)
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(X) is the probability of the observation X (marginal likelihood)

In our problem, we are interested in the posterior odds of A/B, which is equal to P(A|X) / P(B|X). Using Bayes' theorem, we can write this as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities needed for the above equation.

First, we know that the probability of selecting Deck A or B is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given the decks:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Finally, the marginal likelihood P(X) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds of A/B:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                     = ((8/27) * (1/2)) / ((2/81) * (1/2))
                     = 36

So, the posterior odds of having drawn the cards from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 36.

In the requested format:

{odds: 36}
