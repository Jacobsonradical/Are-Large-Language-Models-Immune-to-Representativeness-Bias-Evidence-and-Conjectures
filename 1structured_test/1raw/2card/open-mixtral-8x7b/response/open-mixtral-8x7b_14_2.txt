To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A (with 2/3 X and 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O from A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from A) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A)

Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from A:  A(2/3, 3) * A(1/3, 1) = 20 (using combinations)
Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A:   C(4/3, 4) * C(2/3, 0) = 1

So, P(3X, 1O from A) = 20 / 1 = 20

For Deck B (with 1/3 X and 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O from B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from B) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B)

Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from B:  A(1/3, 3) * A(2/3, 1) = 10
Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B:   C(4/3, 4) * C(2/3, 0) = 1

So, P(3X, 1O from B) = 10 / 1 = 10

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O from A) / P(3X, 1O from B) = 20 / 10 = 2

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 2 = 2

So, the posterior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A.
