To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O in A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O in B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O in A) / P(3X, 1O in B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 27 = 27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 27:1 or simply 27.
