To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, given that Deck A has a 2/3 probability of X and Deck B has a 1/3 probability of X.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio L(A/B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Posterior odds: Posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * L(A/B) = 1 * 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
