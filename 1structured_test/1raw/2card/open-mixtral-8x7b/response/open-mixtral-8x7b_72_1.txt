To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. 

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing each deck:

P(A) = 1/2
P(B) = 1/2

Odds(A) = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now let's find the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324/6

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A | 3X, 1O) = Odds(A) * LR = 1 * (324/6) = 54

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 54.
