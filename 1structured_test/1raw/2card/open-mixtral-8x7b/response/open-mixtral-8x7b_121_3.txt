To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. 

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Let's assume that both decks have an equal probability of being chosen, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then the ratio of these two probabilities:

LR = L(A) / L(B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Finally, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 or just 4.
