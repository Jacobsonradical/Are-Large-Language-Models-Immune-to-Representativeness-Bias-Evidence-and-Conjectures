To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The event of choosing Deck A
B: The event of choosing Deck B
C: The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|C) / P(B|C), the posterior odds of having chosen Deck A over Deck B, given that we have drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since both decks are equally large and are chosen by chance, the prior probabilities are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods P(C|A) and P(C|B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (with 2/3 of the cards marked X) is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (with 1/3 of the cards marked X) is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 2/27

Now, we can find the likelihoods:

P(C|A) = P(3X, 1O|A) × P(A) = (8/27) × (1/2) = 8/54

P(C|B) = P(3X, 1O|B) × P(B) = (2/27) × (1/2) = 2/54

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

P(A|C) / P(B|C) = P(C|A) / P(C|B) = (8/54) / (2/54) = 8/2

{odds: 8/2 or 4}

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 4.
