To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

P(A) as the probability of selecting Deck A,
P(B) as the probability of selecting Deck B,
P(3X, 1O|A) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A,
P(3X, 1O|B) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O), which is equal to the prior odds P(A)/P(B) multiplied by the likelihood ratio L(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B).

First, let's calculate the prior odds:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks and we choose one randomly)
P(A)/P(B) = 1

Now, let's find the likelihoods:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(2/3*N, 3) * C(1/3*N, 1)
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(1/3*N, 3) * C(2/3*N, 1)

Where N is the total number of cards in the deck (assume N is large enough so that the probability of drawing 4 cards without replacement is close to the probability of drawing with replacement). The terms C(p*N, k) represent binomial coefficients, which give the number of ways to choose k successes out of p*N trials.

Now, to simplify the calculation, let's assume N is a multiple of 3. Then, the likelihood ratio is:

L(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)
          = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
          = (2^3 / 1) * (1 / 2)
          = 8

Hence, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 8}
