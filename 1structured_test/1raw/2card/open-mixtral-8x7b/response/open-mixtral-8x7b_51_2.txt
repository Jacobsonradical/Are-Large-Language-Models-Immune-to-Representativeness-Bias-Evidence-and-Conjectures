To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
Since there are two decks, the prior odds can be calculated as:
P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324/54

Posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (324/54) = 324/54

We can simplify this fraction:
{odds: 18/3}
