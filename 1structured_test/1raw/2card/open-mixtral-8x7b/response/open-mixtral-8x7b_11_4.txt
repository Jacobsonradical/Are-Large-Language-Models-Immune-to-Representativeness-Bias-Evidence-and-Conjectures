To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are choosing Deck A and observing 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn. Let's denote these events as A and X|A, respectively. Similarly, we'll use B and X|B to represent choosing Deck B and observing 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn.

First, we'll calculate the prior odds:
P(A) = 1/2 (since either Deck A or Deck B is equally likely to be chosen)
P(B) = 1/2
Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods, P(X|A) and P(X|B):
P(X|A) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn from Deck A:
P(X|A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards)
= (4! / (3! 1!)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

P(X|B) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn from Deck B:
P(X|B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O) / (total number of ways to choose 4 cards)
= (4! / (3! 1!)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)
= P(X|A) / P(X|B) * P(A) / P(B)
= (4! / (3! 1!)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (4! / (3! 1!)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
= (2/3) / (2/3)
= 1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:
{odds: 1}
