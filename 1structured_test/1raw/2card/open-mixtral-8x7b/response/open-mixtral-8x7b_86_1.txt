To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O without considering the given information about the marks on the 4 cards.

P(A) = 1/2 (since either Deck A or B is equally likely to be chosen)
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 = 4/81

Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (4/81) = 3/1

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (3/1) = 3/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 3:1.
