To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

Let's first calculate the prior probabilities:

* The probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2 and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2.

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

* P(3X, 1O from A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

* P(3X, 1O from B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the likelihoods:

* Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O from A) / P(3X, 1O from B) = ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds \* Likelihood Ratio = (1/2) / (1/2) \* ((2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1)
