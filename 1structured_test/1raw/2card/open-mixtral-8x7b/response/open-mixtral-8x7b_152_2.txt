To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let A and B be events representing the selection of decks A and B, respectively, and let X's and O's be events representing drawing cards marked X and O. We want to find the posterior odds of A given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, let's find the prior probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X's, 1/3 O's):
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (1/3 X's, 2/3 O's):
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Next, we'll find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the whole population, assuming a uniform distribution. There are 52 cards, so the probability of drawing an X is 17/26 and the probability of drawing an O is 9/26.

P(3X, 1O) = (17/26)^3 * (9/26) ≈ 178.7/676

Now we'll calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Since we have no information about which deck was more likely to be selected, let's assume a 50/50 chance, or P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(A|3X, 1O) = (16/81) * (1/2) / (178.7/676) ≈ 8/41
P(B|3X, 1O) = (2/81) * (1/2) / (178.7/676) ≈ 1/41

Finally, we'll find the posterior odds:

{odds: 8/1}
