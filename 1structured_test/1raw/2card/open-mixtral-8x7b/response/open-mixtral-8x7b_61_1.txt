To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then multiply these two values together.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B), the likelihood ratio as L(X:O), and the posterior odds as PO(A:B). We are interested in finding PO(A:B).

First, let's calculate the prior odds O(A:B):
Prior to drawing any cards, we know that the probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are:

O(A:B) = 1:1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio L(X:O) based on the information provided about the cards drawn:
- We know that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.
- In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3 and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3 and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.

The likelihood ratio L(X:O) is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and from Deck B:

L(X:O) = P(X=3, O=1 | A) / P(X=3, O=1 | B)
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
= 8/1
= 8

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds PO(A:B) by multiplying the prior odds O(A:B) and the likelihood ratio L(X:O):

PO(A:B) = O(A:B) * L(X:O)
= 1 * 8
= 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1, compared to Deck B. This means that, after observing the cards drawn, it is 8 times more likely that they came from Deck A than Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 8}
