To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in relation to B.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

We are given the following probabilities:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the deck is chosen randomly)

We want to find the odds of A given X and O, so:

P(A|X and O) = P(X and O|A) * P(A) / P(X and O)

Using the formula for conditional probability:

P(X and O) = P(X) * P(O|X) = (3/4) * (1/3) = 1/4

Now, let's compute P(X and O|A):

P(X and O|A) = P(X|A) * P(O|A) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9

Finally, we can compute the odds of A in relation to B:

odds = P(A|X and O) / P(B|X and O) = P(X and O|A) * P(A) / P(X and O|B) * P(B) = (2/9) * (1/2) / ((1/9) * (1/2)) = 2/1 = 2

The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
