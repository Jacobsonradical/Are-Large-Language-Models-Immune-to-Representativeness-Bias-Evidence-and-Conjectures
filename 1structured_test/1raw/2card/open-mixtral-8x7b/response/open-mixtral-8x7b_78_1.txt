To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods of the two decks being selected, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find the odds of A and B given the observed evidence, which is that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, let's find the prior probabilities of A and B. Since we chose one of the decks at random, the prior probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the prior probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2.

Next, let's find the likelihoods of the observed evidence under each hypothesis.

The likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O in Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27

The likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O in Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of A and B given the observed evidence:

posterior odds(A:B) = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

The denominator P(3X, 1O) is the same for both probabilities, and it is the sum of the likelihoods under each hypothesis:

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(B)
P(3X, 1O) = (8/27) \* (1/2) + (2/27) \* (1/2) = 10/54

Now we can find the posterior odds:

posterior odds(A:B) = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
posterior odds(A:B) = (8/27) \* (1/2) / (2/27) \* (1/2)
posteriod odds(A:B) = 8 / 2
posterior odds(A:B) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4:1.
