To solve this problem, we need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then multiply them together to get the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate the prior odds. The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/2

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods of the two decks:

LR = L(A)/L(B) = [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1] = (2/1)^2 = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* LR = (1/2) \* 4 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2.
