To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are choosing Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the 4 cards drawn, or choosing Deck B and drawing the same.

Let A be the event of choosing Deck A, and B be the event of choosing Deck B. Let X be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the 4 cards drawn.

We want to find P(A|X), the probability of choosing Deck A given that we have observed the event X.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

We are given that P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/81, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.

We are also given that P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

We are not given the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. However, since the two decks were chosen randomly, it is reasonable to assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|X) = (8/81) \* (1/2) / ((8/81) \* (1/2) + (2/243) \* (1/2))

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(A|X) = 24/29

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A, given that we have observed 3 X's and 1 O, are:

{odds: 24/5}
