To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/2) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4 : 1 (or simply 4).
