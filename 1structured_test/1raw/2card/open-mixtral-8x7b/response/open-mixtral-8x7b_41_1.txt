To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of the two decks being selected, which is 1:1 or simply 1 since the decks are chosen with equal probability.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that the deck has been chosen at random.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A)
= (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3) / (4 choose 3)
= 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B)
= (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) / (4 choose 3)
= 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:
Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/2 = 4

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

The posterior odds are 4, meaning that the odds are 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A after observing 3 X's and 1 O compared to Deck B.
