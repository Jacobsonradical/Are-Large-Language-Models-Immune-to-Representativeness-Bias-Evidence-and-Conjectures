To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which describes how to update our beliefs based on evidence. Let's denote the hypothesis H as "the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A" and the evidence E as "3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O." We want to find the posterior odds:

posterior odds(H) = P(H|E) / P(~H|E)

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- P(H) = P(Deck A) = 1/2 (assuming there's an equal chance of selecting either deck)
- P(~H) = P(Deck B) = 1 - P(Deck A) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihoods. Given that we've drawn 4 cards, there are 15 possible combinations (4! / (3!(4-3)!)). Let's denote the number of X's in a combination as n_X.

- P(E|H) = P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
- P(E|~H) = P(3 X's and 1 O in Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities:

- P(H|E) = P(E and H) / P(E) = P(E and H) / [P(E and H) + P(E and ~H)]
- P(H|E) = [P(H) * P(E|H)] / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]
- P(H|E) = (1/2) * (8/27) / [(1/2) * (8/27) + (1/2) * (2/27)] = 8/10

Simplifying the posterior odds:

posterior odds(H) = P(H|E) / P(~H|E) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4

The answer is:
{odds: 4}
