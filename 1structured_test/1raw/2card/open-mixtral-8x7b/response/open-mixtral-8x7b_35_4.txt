To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B separately.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Finally, the posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
