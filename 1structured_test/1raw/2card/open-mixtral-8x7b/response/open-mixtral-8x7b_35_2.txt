To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in relation to B, given that we know 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
- P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
- There are 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's in Deck A.
- We draw 4 cards, so there are combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.
- The number of combinations is C(12, 3) * C(12, 1), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- So, the likelihood is C(12, 3) * C(12, 1) / C(24, 4).

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
- There are 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's in Deck B.
- We draw 4 cards, so there are combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.
- The number of combinations is C(8, 3) * C(16, 1), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- So, the likelihood is C(8, 3) * C(16, 1) / C(24, 4).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|3 X's and 1 O) / P(B|3 X's and 1 O) = P(A) * P(3 X's and 1 O|A) / P(B) * P(3 X's and 1 O|B)

Plug in the values and simplify:

= (1/2) * [C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)] / [C(24, 4)] * [C(8, 3) * C(16, 1)] / [C(24, 4)] * (1/2)

= [C(12, 3) * C(12, 1)] / [C(8, 3) * C(16, 1)]

= (220 * 12) / (56 * 16)

= 11/4

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 11/4}
