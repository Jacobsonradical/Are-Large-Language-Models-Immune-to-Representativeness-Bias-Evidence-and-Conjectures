To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3) = 16/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the observed outcome under each hypothesis:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, we calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

Thus, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A, compared to deck B, are 8.
