To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are choosing Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

Let D = event of choosing Deck A, and E = event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find P(D|E), the probability of choosing Deck A given that we have drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(D|E) = P(E|D) * P(D) / P(E)

First, let's find P(E|D): the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.

P(E|D) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)

There are C(2/3*52, 3) ways to choose 3 X's from the 2/3 * 52 X's in Deck A and C(1/3*52, 1) ways to choose 1 O from the 1/3 * 52 O's in Deck A. The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from 52 cards is C(52, 4).

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

So,

P(E|D) = [C(2/3*52, 3) * C(1/3*52, 1)] / C(52, 4)

Next, let's find P(D): the probability of choosing Deck A. Since there are only two decks and the selection is random, P(D) = 1/2.

Now, let's find P(E): the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O without specifying the deck. This can happen in two ways: choosing Deck A and drawing from it, or choosing Deck B and drawing from it.

P(E) = P(E and D) + P(E and not D)

P(E and D) = P(E|D) * P(D)

P(E and not D) = P(E|not D) * P(not D)

Note that P(not D) = 1 - P(D) = 1/2.

Now, we need to find P(E|not D), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

P(E|not D) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)

There are C(1/3*52, 3) ways to choose 3 X's from the 1/3 * 52 X's in Deck B and C(2/3*52, 1) ways to choose 1 O from the 2/3 * 52 O's in Deck B. The total number of ways to draw 4 cards from 52 cards is C(52, 4).

So,

P(E|not D) = [C(1/3*52, 3) * C(2/3*52, 1)] / C(52, 4)

Now, we have all the pieces to find P(D|E):

P(D|E) = P(E|D) * P(D) / P(E)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(D|E) ≈ 0.7346

Finally, the posterior odds are:

odds = P(D|E) / P(not D|E)

We found P(D|E) ≈ 0.7346, and P(not D|E) = 1 - P(D|E) ≈ 0.2654.

So,

{odds: 0.7346 / 0.2654}
{odds: 2.767}
