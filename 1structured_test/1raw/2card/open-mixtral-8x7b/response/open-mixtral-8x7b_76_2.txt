To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of choosing Deck B is also 1/2. Thus, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We want to compare the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we chose either Deck A or Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 16/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio L(A/B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/2 = 8

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds with the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is:

{odds: 8}
