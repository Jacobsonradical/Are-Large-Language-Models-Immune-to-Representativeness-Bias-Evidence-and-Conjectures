To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of probabilities of the two decks being selected, which is 1:1 or 1 in this case since the selection is random.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the deck is A to the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the deck is B.

Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A:
P(3X, 1O|A) = C(2/3 * n, 3) * C(1/3 * n, 1) / C(n, 4)
where n is the total number of cards in each deck (assumed to be equal).

Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B:
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(1/3 * n, 3) * C(2/3 * n, 1) / C(n, 4)

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = Likelihood ratio

Substituting the expressions for the probabilities:

Posterior odds = [C(2/3 * n, 3) * C(1/3 * n, 1)] / [C(1/3 * n, 3) * C(2/3 * n, 1)]

Assuming that n is large, we can approximate the combinations as follows:

C(p * n, k) ≈ (p^k * n^k) / k!

Plugging this back into the formula, we get:

Posterior odds ≈ [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * n^4] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * n^4]

Simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds = (2/1)^3 = 8

{odds: 8}
