To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We need to find the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(8,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 56 * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(2,1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 56 * (2/3)^4 * (1/3) / (2 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Likelihood ratio â‰ˆ 28

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 28 = 28

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O, are 28. This means that the evidence of observing 3 X's and 1 O is 28 times more likely under Deck A than Deck B.

The answer is:
{odds: 28}
