To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in relation to B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A or Deck B. Since the decks are very large, the probability of selecting either deck is equal, so let's assume the prior probability of A and B is 0.5 each.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 2/27.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of A and B:

P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) * P(A) / P(X=3, O=1|B) * P(B)
= (8/27) * (1/2) / (2/27) * (1/2)
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1, or simply:

{odds: 4}
