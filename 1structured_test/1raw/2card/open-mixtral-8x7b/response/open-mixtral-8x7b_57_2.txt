To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B before any cards are drawn, which is:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal selection probability for both decks)

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is the likelihood of the observed outcome under the hypothesis that the cards came from Deck A divided by the likelihood under the hypothesis that they came from Deck B:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = (1/2) * 27 = 13.5

Format the answer as follows:
{odds: 13.5}
