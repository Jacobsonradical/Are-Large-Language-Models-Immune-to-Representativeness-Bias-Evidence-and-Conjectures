To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio. In this case, the prior odds are 1 (since there's no a priori reason to prefer one deck over the other), and the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from deck A or B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/81.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243.

The likelihood ratio is therefore (8/81) / (2/243) = 36/9 = 4:1.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are 4:1, or simply:

{odds: 4}
