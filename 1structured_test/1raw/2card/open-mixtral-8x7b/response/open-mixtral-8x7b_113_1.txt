To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is also 1/2, so the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
We'll calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio: P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Posterior odds:
We multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 12 = 12

{odds: 12}
