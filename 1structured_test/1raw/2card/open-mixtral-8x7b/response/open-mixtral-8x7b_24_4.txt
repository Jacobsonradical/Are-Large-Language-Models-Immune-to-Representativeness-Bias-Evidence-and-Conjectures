To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: To find this, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O in A) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from A) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from A)
= [(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3)] / [(52 choose 4)]
= 128 / [52! / (4! * 48!)]

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O in B) = (Number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from B) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards from B)
= [(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)] / [52! / (4! * 48!)]
= 8 / [52! / (4! * 48!)]

Now, the likelihood ratio is the probability of drawing the observed outcome from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing it from Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O in A) / P(3X, 1O in B)
= 128 * 3^4 / (8 * 2^4)

Finally, the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * (128 * 3^4 / (8 * 2^4))
= 3375

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are 3375:1.
