To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then combine them to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A/B) and the likelihood ratio as LR(X/O).

Prior odds:
The prior probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, which is 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

O(A/B) = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Likelihood ratio:
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B are:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:

LR(X/O) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4

Posterior odds:
Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = O(A/B) \* LR(X/O) = (1/2) \* (324/4) = 162

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, are 162.
