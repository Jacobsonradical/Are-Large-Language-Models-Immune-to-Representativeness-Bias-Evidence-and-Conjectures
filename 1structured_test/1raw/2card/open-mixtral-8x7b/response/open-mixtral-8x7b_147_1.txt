To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B, which are equal since the decks are chosen by chance. So, the prior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards are drawn from deck A and deck B. We'll denote these probabilities as P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/27

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* LR = 1 \* 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are 4:1, compared to deck B.
