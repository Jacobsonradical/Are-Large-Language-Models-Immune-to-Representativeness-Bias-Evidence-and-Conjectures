To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio (LR). The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio (LR):

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 729/54

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio (LR):

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * (729/54) = 13.5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 13.5.

{odds: 13.5}
