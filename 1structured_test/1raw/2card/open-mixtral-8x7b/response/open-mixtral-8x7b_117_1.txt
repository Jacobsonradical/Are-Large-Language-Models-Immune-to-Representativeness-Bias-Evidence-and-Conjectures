To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the observed data under the two hypotheses. So the likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = L(X|A) / L(X|B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Posterior odds: The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio = 1 \* 4 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4 : 1 or simply 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
