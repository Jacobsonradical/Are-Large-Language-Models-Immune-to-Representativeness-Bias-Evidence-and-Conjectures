To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Since both decks are very large, let's assume they have the same number of cards, say N. Then, the probability of choosing deck A or B is equal. Therefore, the prior odds are 1.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

Let's find the probabilities for each deck:

P(3X and 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X and 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = 8/27 / 2/243 = 32/3

The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = 1 * (32/3) = 32/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are {odds: 32/3}.
