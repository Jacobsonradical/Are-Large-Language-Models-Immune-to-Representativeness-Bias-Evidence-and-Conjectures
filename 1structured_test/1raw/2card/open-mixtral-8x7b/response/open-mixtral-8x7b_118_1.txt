To solve this problem, we'll use the Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the probability of selecting each deck, and the new evidence is the composition of the 4 cards.

Let's denote:

P(A) = the prior probability of selecting Deck A
P(B) = the prior probability of selecting Deck B
P(X|A) = the probability of drawing an X from Deck A
P(X|B) = the probability of drawing an X from Deck B
P(X and A) = the probability of drawing an X and selecting Deck A
P(X and B) = the probability of drawing an X and selecting Deck B
P(X) = the overall probability of drawing an X, given the new evidence

We are given:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen)
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(X|B) = 1/3

From the new evidence, we have:
P(X and A) / P(X and B) = (3/4) / (1/4) = 3/1

Now, we can calculate:

P(X) = P(X and A) + P(X and B) = (3/4) * (1/2) + (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/2

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X and A) / P(X) * P(A) / [P(X and B) / P(X) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), this simplifies to:

Posterior odds = P(X and A) / P(X and B) = 3/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 3}
