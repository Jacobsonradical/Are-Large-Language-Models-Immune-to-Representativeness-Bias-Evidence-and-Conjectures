To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks are very large, we can ignore the difference in composition when selecting one deck). So, the prior odds are:

prior_odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio by dividing the likelihood of the observed outcome given Deck A by the likelihood given Deck B:

likelihood_ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 729/12

Finally, we can obtain the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

posterior_odds = prior_odds * likelihood_ratio = 1 * (729/12) = 60.75

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 60.75.
