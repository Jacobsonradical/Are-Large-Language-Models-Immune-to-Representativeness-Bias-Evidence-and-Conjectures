To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem and the concept of odds. First, let's calculate the prior probabilities and likelihoods.

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks are chosen randomly)

P(3X from A) = C(2/3*52, 3) / C(52, 3) = 1326 / 22100 ≈ 0.05996
P(1O from A) = C(1/3*52, 1) / C(52, 1) = 17 / 52 ≈ 0.32692
P(3X and 1O from A) = P(3X from A) * P(1O from A) ≈ 0.01953

P(3X from B) = C(1/3*52, 3) / C(52, 3) = 238 / 22100 ≈ 0.01076
P(1O from B) = C(2/3*52, 1) / C(52, 1) = 34 / 52 ≈ 0.65385
P(3X and 1O from B) = P(3X from B) * P(1O from B) ≈ 0.00706

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(3X and 1O from A) / P(3X and 1O from B) = 0.01953 / 0.00706 ≈ 2.7656

{odds: 2.7656}
