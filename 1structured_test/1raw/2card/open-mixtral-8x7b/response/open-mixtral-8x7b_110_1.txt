To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B. Since the decks are very large and the selection is random, we can assume that the probability of choosing either deck is equal (50% or 0.5). So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 72

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 72 = 72

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 72. This means that, given the observed outcome, it is 72 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
