To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and posterior probabilities.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A
P(B) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B
P(X|A) as the probability of drawing an X from Deck A
P(X|B) as the probability of drawing an X from Deck B
P(4X,1O|A) as the probability of drawing 4 X's and 1 O from Deck A
P(4X,1O|B) as the probability of drawing 4 X's and 1 O from Deck B

Since both decks are very large, we can assume that they don't change significantly when we draw cards from them. Therefore, the probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 4 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(4X,1O|A) = (2/3)^4 \* (1/3)^1
P(4X,1O|B) = (1/3)^4 \* (2/3)^1

To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O) = P(4X,1O|A) \* P(A) / P(4X,1O|B) \* P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|4X,1O) / P(B|4X,1O) = (2/3)^4 \* (1/3)^1 \* 0.5 / (1/3)^4 \* (2/3)^1 \* 0.5 = 2^4 / 1 = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 16}
