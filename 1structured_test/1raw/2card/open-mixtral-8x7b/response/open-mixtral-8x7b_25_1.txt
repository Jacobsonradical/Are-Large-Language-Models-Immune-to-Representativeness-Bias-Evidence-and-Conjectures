To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
L(A) = (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3) = 16/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
L(B) = (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = L(A) / L(B) = 16/81 * 81/2 = 16/2 = 8

Finally, the posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O is:

{odds: 8}
