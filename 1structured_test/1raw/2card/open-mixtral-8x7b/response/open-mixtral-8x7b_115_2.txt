To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that deck A was selected, and P(B) as the probability that deck B was selected. We want to find the posterior odds of drawing from deck A given that we've seen 3 X's and 1 O.

Let's first calculate the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since we chose either deck A or B with equal probability)

Next, we calculate the likelihoods:
- P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) * P(A) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
P(B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | B) * P(B) / P(3 X's and 1 O)

The evidence P(3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) * P(A) + P(3 X's and 1 O | B) * P(B)

Substituting the values:
P(3 X's and 1 O) = (8/27) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2) = 46/486

Now we can find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324/6 = 54

So the posterior odds favoring deck A are:
{odds: 54}
