To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood probabilities, and then use them to find the posterior odds.

1. Prior probabilities: The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as that of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2 for each.

2. Likelihood probabilities:
   - Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81.
   - Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81.

3. Posterior odds: To find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior probabilities by the likelihood probabilities:
   - Posterior probability for Deck A: (1/2)*(16/81) = 8/81.
   - Posterior probability for Deck B: (1/2)*(2/81) = 1/81.

Now, we can find the posterior odds by dividing the posterior probability of Deck A by the posterior probability of Deck B:

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (1/81) = 8/1

Therefore, the posterior odds are {odds: 8}.
