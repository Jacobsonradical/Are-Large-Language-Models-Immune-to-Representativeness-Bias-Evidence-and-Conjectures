To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds of A vs B:
Since there are two decks and the selection is random, the prior probability of selecting deck A is the same as that for deck B, i.e., 1/2.
Thus, the prior odds are (1/2) : (1/2) = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio:
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
P(3X, 1O in A) = C(13, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 286/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is given by the binomial distribution:
P(3X, 1O in B) = C(20, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 1250/648

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities for deck A and deck B, i.e.,
LR = P(3X, 1O in A) / P(3X, 1O in B) = (286/27) / (1250/648)

Posterior odds:
The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = 1 * LR = (286/27) / (1250/648) â‰ˆ 0.1411

{odds: 0.1411}
