To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

Here, A and B represent the two decks, and X represents the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, these probabilities are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Next, let's determine the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B). To do this, we'll use the binomial probability formula:

P(X|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
        = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3)
        = 32/81

P(X|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
        = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
        = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|X):

P(A|X) = (32/81) * 0.5 / ((32/81) * 0.5 + (8/81) * 0.5)
       = 32/40
       = 4/5

The posterior odds are the posterior probability of A divided by the posterior probability of B:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)
               = (4/5) / (1 - 4/5)
               = 4/1

So, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.
