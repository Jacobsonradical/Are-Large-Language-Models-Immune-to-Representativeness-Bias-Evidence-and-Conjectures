To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. 

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B before drawing the cards is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

- Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81.
- Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81.

The likelihood ratio (LR) is the probability of the evidence given Deck A divided by the probability of the evidence given Deck B:

LR = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Posterior odds = prior odds * likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of Deck A.
