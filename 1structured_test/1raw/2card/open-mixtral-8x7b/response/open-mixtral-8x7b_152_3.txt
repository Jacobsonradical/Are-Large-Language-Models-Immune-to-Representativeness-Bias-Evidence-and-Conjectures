To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (both decks are equally likely to be chosen)

Prior odds for Deck B:
P(B) = 1/2

Likelihood ratio:
P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

To calculate these probabilities, we use the binomial distribution.

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 

Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Posterior odds:
Odds(A | 3X, 1O) = Prior odds(A) * Likelihood ratio
Odds(A | 3X, 1O) = (1/2) * 4
Odds(A | 3X, 1O) = 2

{odds: 2}
