To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) are equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio. In this case, the prior odds are 1 (since we have no reason to favor one deck over the other before seeing the cards), and the likelihood ratio is the probability of seeing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from deck A, divided by the probability of seeing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from deck B.

Let's calculate the likelihoods:

P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Likelihood Ratio = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8.
