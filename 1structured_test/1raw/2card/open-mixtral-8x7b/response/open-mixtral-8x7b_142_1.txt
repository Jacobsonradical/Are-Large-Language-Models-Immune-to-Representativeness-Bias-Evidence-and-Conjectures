To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen)

Prior odds for Deck B:
P(B) = 1/2

Now let's compute the likelihood ratio. We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck given that we know 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X's and 1/3 are O's, while in Deck B, 1/3 are X's and 2/3 are O's.

Likelihood of the data (D) given Deck A (A):
P(D|A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 2/3 of the deck) * (number of ways to choose 1 O out of 1/3 of the deck)
       = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Likelihood of the data (D) given Deck B (B):
P(D|B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 1/3 of the deck) * (number of ways to choose 1 O out of 2/3 of the deck)
       = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can compute the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) = 2^3 / 2^1 = 2^2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
               = (1/2) * 2^2
               = 1 * 4
               = 4

So the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
