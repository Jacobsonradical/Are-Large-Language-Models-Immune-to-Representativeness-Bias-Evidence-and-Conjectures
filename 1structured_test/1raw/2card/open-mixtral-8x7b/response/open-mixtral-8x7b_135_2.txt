To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then combine them to get the posterior odds.

1. Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

2. Likelihood ratio for 3 X's and 1 O:
   - For Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
   - For Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.
   So, the likelihood ratio is (8/27) / (2/243) = 32/3.

3. Posterior odds: We multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds: 1 * (32/3) = 32/3.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 32:3.

Final answer: {odds: 32/3}
