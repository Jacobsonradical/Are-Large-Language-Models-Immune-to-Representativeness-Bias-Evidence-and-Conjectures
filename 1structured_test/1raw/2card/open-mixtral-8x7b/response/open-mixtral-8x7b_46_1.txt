To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or B before seeing any cards. Since both decks have an equal chance of being selected, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O under Deck A and Deck B. We'll calculate these probabilities separately.

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O in A) = P(XXXO in A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O in B) = P(XXXO in B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, the likelihood ratio is the probability of drawing the observed results from Deck A divided by the probability of drawing the observed results from Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 6

Finally, we multiply the prior odds and the likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (324 / 6) = {odds: 54}

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 54:1.
