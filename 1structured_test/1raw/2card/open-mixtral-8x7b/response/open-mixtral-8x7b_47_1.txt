To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds for Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (since both decks have an equal chance of being selected)

Prior odds for Deck B:
P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1/2) * 27 = 13.5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 13.5.

{odds: 13.5}
