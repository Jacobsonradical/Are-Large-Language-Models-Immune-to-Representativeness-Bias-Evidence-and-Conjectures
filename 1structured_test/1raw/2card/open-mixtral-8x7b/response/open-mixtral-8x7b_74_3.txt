To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck was done randomly, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Hence, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 × (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 × (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, are 4.
