To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

- Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 8/81.
- Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81.

The likelihood ratio is then 8/81 : 2/81, which simplifies to 4 : 1.

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 1 * (4/1) = 4}
