To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 8/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = Probability of drawing from Deck A / Probability of drawing from Deck B
                 = (8/81) / (2/81)
                 = 4

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
               = 0.5 * 4
               = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 were marked X and 1 was marked O, are 2.
