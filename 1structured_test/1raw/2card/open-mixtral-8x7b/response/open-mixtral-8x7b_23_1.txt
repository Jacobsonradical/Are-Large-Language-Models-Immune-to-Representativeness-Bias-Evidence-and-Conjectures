To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the prior probability of selecting Deck A as PA and the prior probability of selecting Deck B as PB. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is denoted as P(E|A) and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is denoted as P(E|B). We are interested in finding the posterior odds, which is given by:

Posterior odds = (PA \* P(E|A)) / (PB \* P(E|B))

We are given that the probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, so PA = PB = 1/2. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1. Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = (1/2 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1) / (1/2 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1) = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4/1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
