To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = (1:1) * (324:4) = 324:4

So, the posterior odds are 324:4 or 81:1 in favor of Deck A.
