To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (1/2) since the decks are chosen randomly. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, given that 4 cards have been drawn.

Let P(A) be the probability of choosing Deck A, P(B) be the probability of choosing Deck B, P(X|A) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck A, P(O|A) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck A, P(X|B) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck B, and P(O|B) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck B.

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3

P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(12, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/4!)
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(12, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/4!)

C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!)

Now calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = [(12! / (3! * 9!)) * (8/27) * (1/24)] / [(12! / (3! * 9!)) * (1/27) * (16/24)]

Likelihood Ratio = 8 / 16

Likelihood Ratio = 1/2

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio

Posterior Odds = (1/2) * (1/2)

Posterior Odds = 1/4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 1/4.
