To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
- The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, which is 1/2.
- So, the prior odds are (1/2) / (1/2) = 1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio.

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324/54

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (324/54) = 324/54

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 324/54 or simplified to 18/3.

{odds: 18/3}
