To solve this problem, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypotheses are that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B, and the evidence is that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and P(B) as the prior probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. Since the two decks are very large and one of them was selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Let's denote P(E|A) as the probability of observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we can calculate P(E|A) as follows:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

Let's denote P(E|B) as the probability of observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we can calculate P(E|B) as follows:

P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate the posterior odds of the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B using the Bayes' theorem:

posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E|B) \* P(B) = 8/27 \* 0.5 / (2/243) \* 0.5 = 216/2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 216:1.

Answer: {odds: 216}
