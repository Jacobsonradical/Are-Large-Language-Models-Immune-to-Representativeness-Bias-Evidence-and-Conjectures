To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The probability of choosing Deck A is the same as choosing Deck B, which is 1/2 for each. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Likelihood ratio:
We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Where N is the total number of cards in each deck. We can simplify the likelihood ratio as follows:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2^3 / 3^2) / (2 / 3^3) = 2^4 / 3

Posterior odds:
Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * (2^4 / 3) = 2^3 / 3 â‰ˆ 8/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 8:3.
