To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of choosing Deck A as A and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as XO. We want to find the odds of A given XO, which can be written as:

P(A|XO) / P(B|XO)

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|XO) = P(XO|A) * P(A) / P(XO)
P(B|XO) = P(XO|B) * P(B) / P(XO)

Since we have equal probabilities of choosing either deck, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, let's calculate P(XO|A) and P(XO|B).

P(XO|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have chosen Deck A. This can be calculated as:

C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4), where N is the total number of cards in the deck.

Similarly, P(XO|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have chosen Deck B, which can be calculated as:

C(1/3M, 3) * C(2/3M, 1) / C(M, 4), where M is the total number of cards in the deck.

Since the problem statement doesn't specify the total number of cards in the deck, let's assume that both decks have a large number of cards. In this case, we can approximate the probabilities using the binomial distribution, which becomes approximately normal for large sample sizes.

P(XO|A) ≈ P(3 X's in 4 draws) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(XO|B) ≈ P(3 X's in 4 draws) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's in 4 draws, P(3 X's in 4 draws), is approximately 0.2266, and we can calculate the approximate probabilities as follows:

P(XO|A) ≈ 0.2266 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.0909
P(XO|B) ≈ 0.2266 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0182

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

odds = P(A|XO) / P(B|XO) = P(XO|A) / P(XO|B) ≈ 0.0909 / 0.0182 ≈ 5

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 5 to 1.
