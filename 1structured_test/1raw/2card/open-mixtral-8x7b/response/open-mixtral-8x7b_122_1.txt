To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then multiply them to get the posterior odds.

Let's assume there are N cards in each deck. We'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) * P(A) / P(XXXO)

First, let's find P(A), the prior probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A. This is simply the probability of choosing Deck A at random, which is 1/2 since there are only two decks.

Next, let's find P(XXXO|A), the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. There are 2/3 probability of drawing an X and 1/3 probability of drawing an O from Deck A. The order doesn't matter, so we can use combinations to find the number of ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from N cards:

C(N, 3) = N! / (3! * (N - 3)!)

Similarly, for Deck B, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

C(N, 1) = N! / (1! * (N - 1)!)

Now we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B) = [C(N, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [C(N, 1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Finally, let's calculate the prior odds and multiply it by the likelihood ratio:

Prior Odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2
Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio

We can simplify the likelihood ratio by canceling out some terms:

Likelihood Ratio = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4

Posterior Odds = 1/2 * 4 = 2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 2.
