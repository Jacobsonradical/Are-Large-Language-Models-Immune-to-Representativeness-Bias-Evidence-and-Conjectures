To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Let N be the number of cards in each deck. The likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

Using the given information that 3/4 of the drawn cards are X's, we can write the following equation:

P(3X, 1O | A) * 2/3 + P(3X, 1O | B) * 1/3 = 3/4

Solve for the likelihood ratio (LR) and multiply it by the prior odds. In this question, N is not specified, but the answer should be in the form of an odds ratio without specific values.
