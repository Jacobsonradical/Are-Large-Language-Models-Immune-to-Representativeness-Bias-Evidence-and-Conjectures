To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting decks A and B. Since there is no information suggesting a preference for one deck over the other, the prior probabilities are both 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1 : 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods, which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have chosen decks A and B.

Likelihood of 3 X's and 1 O given deck A (L(A)):
(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 128 / 2187

Likelihood of 3 X's and 1 O given deck B (L(B)):
(1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 8 / 2187

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= (1 : 1) * (128/2187) / (8/2187)
= 128 : 8
= 16 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 16 : 1, meaning it is 16 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.

In the requested format:
{odds: 16}
