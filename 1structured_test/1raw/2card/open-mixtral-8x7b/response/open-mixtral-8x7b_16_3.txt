To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "drawing 4 cards from Deck A" and "drawing 3 X's and 1 O."

Let A represent the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B represent the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Decks A and B. Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as N. Since there are two decks, and we know that one of them was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihoods of observing 3 X's and 1 O under each hypothesis.

- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 8/27

- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(A) \* P(X|A)] / [P(B) \* P(X|B)] = (1/2) \* (8/27) / (1/2) \* (2/27) = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4:1, or simply 4, in favor of Deck A. This means that, given the observed outcome, it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
