To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods involved. The prior probabilities are the probabilities of choosing either deck A or deck B, which are equal (assuming a fair selection process), so let's denote them as P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have chosen deck A or deck B. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of drawing X or O for each card, since the draws are independent.

For deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

For deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* (Likelihood ratio)
= (0.5 / 0.5) \* (8/27 / 2/81)
= (8/27) / (2/81)
= 324/54
= 6

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 6:1. This means that, based on the information provided, it is 6 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.

In the requested format, our answer would be:
{odds: 6}
