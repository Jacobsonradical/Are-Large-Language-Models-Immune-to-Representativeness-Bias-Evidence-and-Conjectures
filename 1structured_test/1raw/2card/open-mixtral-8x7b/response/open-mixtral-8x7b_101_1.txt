To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event of choosing Deck A, and B represent the event of choosing Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds of A given the evidence E, which is having 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the deck is chosen randomly)

Next, we need to find the likelihoods, P(E|A) and P(E|B):
- P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, given that 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O. This can be calculated as the combination of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from the respective proportions:
  P(E|A) = C(2/3 * 52, 3) * C(1/3 * 52, 1) / C(52, 4)
- Similarly, P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, given that 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O:
  P(E|B) = C(1/3 * 52, 3) * C(2/3 * 52, 1) / C(52, 4)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = P(A) * P(E|A) / P(B) * P(E|B) = P(E|A) / P(E|B)

Using a calculator to compute the combinations, we get:
odds = 1.8579 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A is approximately 1.86.
