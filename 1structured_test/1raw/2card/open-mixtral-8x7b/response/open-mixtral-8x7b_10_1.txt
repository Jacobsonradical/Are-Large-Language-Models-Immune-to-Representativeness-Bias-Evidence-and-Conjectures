To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks are equally likely to be chosen). So, the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've drawn from Deck A and Deck B.

In Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

In Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

So, the likelihood ratio is:

(8/27) / (2/243) = 324/54

The posterior odds are then the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio. In this case, since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are simply the likelihood ratio:

{odds: 324/54} or {odds: 6.00} when rounded to two decimal places.
