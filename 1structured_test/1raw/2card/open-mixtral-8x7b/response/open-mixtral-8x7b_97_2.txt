To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:
Prior odds = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We know that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O. We want to find the probability of observing this outcome given that we have drawn from deck A or B.

Likelihood(A) = P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
Likelihood(B) = P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

Here N is the total number of cards in the deck. Since we are looking for a ratio, the value of N cancels out:

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B)
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(2N/3, 3) * C(N/3, 1)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(N/3, 3) * C(2N/3, 1)]
= [(2/3)^4 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^4 * (2/3)]
= (2/3)^3

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * (2/3)^3
= 8/27

{odds: 8/27}
