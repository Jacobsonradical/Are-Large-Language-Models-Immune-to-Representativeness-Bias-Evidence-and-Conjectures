To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: Now let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A, and the probability of drawing the same configuration given that we drew from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4

Now we can calculate the posterior odds using the formula:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

Posterior odds = (1 : 1) * (324 : 4) = 324 : 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 324 : 4.
