To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in favor of B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O. In other words, we want to find P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1).

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A or Deck B. Since the two decks are very large, drawing 4 cards will not significantly affect the proportion of X and O cards in each deck, so we can use the same probabilities as for individual cards. Therefore, P(A) = 2/3 and P(B) = 1/3.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card under each hypothesis. If the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card is given by the hypergeometric distribution:

P(X=3, O=1|A) = (4 choose 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* (44/45)
= 4 \* (8/27) \* (1/3) \* (44/45)
= 352/3885

Similarly, if the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B, the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(X=3, O=1|B) = (4 choose 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* (32/33)
= 4 \* (1/27) \* (2/3) \* (32/33)
= 256/2973

Finally, we can find the posterior probabilities of each hypothesis using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) \* P(A) / P(X=3, O=1)
= (352/3885) \* (2/3) / ((352/3885) \* (2/3) + (256/2973) \* (1/3))
= 704/953

P(B|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|B) \* P(B) / P(X=3, O=1)
= (256/2973) \* (1/3) / ((352/3885) \* (2/3) + (256/2973) \* (1/3))
= 256/953

Therefore, the posterior odds of A in favor of B are:

odds = P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)
= 704/256
= 2.75

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is approximately 2.75.
