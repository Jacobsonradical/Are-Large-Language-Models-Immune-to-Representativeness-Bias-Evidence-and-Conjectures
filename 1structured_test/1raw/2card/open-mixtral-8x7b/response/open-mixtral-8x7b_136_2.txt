To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are selecting Deck A or B, and observing 3 X's and 1 O in the sample of 4 cards. We need to find the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, given the observed sample.

Let's denote the selection of Deck A as event A and the selection of Deck B as event B. According to the problem, the two decks are equally likely to be selected, so the prior probabilities are P(A)=P(B)=0.5.

Now, let's denote the event of observing 3 X's and 1 O as XO. We need to find the conditional probabilities P(XO|A) and P(XO|B), which are the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn from Deck A or Deck B.

Since the sample consists of 4 cards, and in Deck A 2/3 of the cards are marked X, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(XO|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

Similarly, in Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, so the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(XO|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 2/27

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|XO) = P(XO|A) × P(A) / (P(XO|A) × P(A) + P(XO|B) × P(B))

P(B|XO) = P(XO|B) × P(B) / (P(XO|A) × P(A) + P(XO|B) × P(B))

The posterior odds are the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

odds(A:B|XO) = P(A|XO) / P(B|XO) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

So, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4:1, or simply 4.
