To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in favor of B, given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find the prior probabilities of A and B. Since the decks are very large, the probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of observing 3 X's and 1 O under each hypothesis.

P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) \* 4! / (3! \* 1!) = 4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)

P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) \* 4! / (3! \* 1!) = 4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) \* P(A) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
P(B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | B) \* P(B) / P(3 X's and 1 O)

To find the posterior odds, we can divide the posterior probabilities:

posterior_odds = P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Posterior odds = {(4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)) / ((4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)) + (4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)))}

{odds: 8}
