To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the events before any evidence is taken into account. In this case, the probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of obtaining the observed evidence (3 X's and 1 O) under the two hypotheses (A and B). We'll denote these probabilities as P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B).

First, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | A):

The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O from Deck A is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 8/27

Now, let's calculate P(3X, 1O | B):

The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O from Deck B is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × 4! / (3! × 1!) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 × 81/2 = 32/1

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 32/1 = 32

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 32}
