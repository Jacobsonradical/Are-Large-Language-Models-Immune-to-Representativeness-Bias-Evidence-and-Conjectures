To find the posterior odds, we need to first calculate the prior odds and then multiply it by the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B. Since the selection of the deck is done by chance, the prior probabilities for both decks are equal, i.e., 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Now, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn cards from Deck A and Deck B.

Deck A: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Deck B: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, we calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = L(A) / L(B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 8

Finally, to find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 8 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1.

In the requested format:
