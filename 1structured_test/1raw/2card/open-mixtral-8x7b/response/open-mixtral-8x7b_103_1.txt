To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B before drawing any cards. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B.

Let's denote the probability of drawing an X as P(X) and the probability of drawing an O as P(O). We know that P(X) = 2/3 for Deck A and 1/3 for Deck B. Similarly, P(O) = 1/3 for Deck A and 2/3 for Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1 or simply 4.
