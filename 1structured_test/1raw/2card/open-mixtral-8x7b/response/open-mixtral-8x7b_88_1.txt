To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))

In this case, our event A is drawing from Deck A, and event B is drawing from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A given X, where X represents drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since both decks are very large and equally likely to be chosen, these probabilities are equal, so:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find P(X|A) and P(X|B). These are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've drawn from Decks A and B, respectively.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can calculate P(A|X):

P(A|X) = (8/27) * (1/2) / ((8/27) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2))
P(A|X) ≈ 0.9902

Now, to find the odds, we need to divide P(A|X) by 1 - P(A|X):

Odds = 0.9902 / (1 - 0.9902) ≈ 125.47

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 125.47.
