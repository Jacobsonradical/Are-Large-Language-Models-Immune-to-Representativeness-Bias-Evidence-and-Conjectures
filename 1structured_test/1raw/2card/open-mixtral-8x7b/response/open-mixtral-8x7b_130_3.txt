To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. Given that we have 3 X's and 1 O, we need to find the probability of this happening if the 4 cards come from Deck A and Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio:

L(A, B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds:

(P(A) / P(B)) × L(A, B) = (1 : 1) × 12 = 12 : 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 12 : 1.
