To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior and likelihood ratios, and then multiply them together to get the posterior odds.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B) and the likelihood ratio as LR(X:O). We want to find the posterior odds, O(A:B | XXXO):

O(A:B | XXXO) = O(A:B) * LR(X:O)

First, let's calculate the prior odds, O(A:B). Since the decks are very large, the probabilities of drawing 4 cards from either deck are approximately equal, so the prior odds are determined by the ratio of X-marked cards in each deck:

O(A:B) = P(A)/P(B) = (2/3 : 1/3) = 2:1

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, LR(X:O). This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing XXXO from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

P(XXXO | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 16/81
P(XXXO | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81

LR(X:O) = P(XXXO | A) / P(XXXO | B) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, let's calculate the posterior odds, O(A:B | XXXO):

O(A:B | XXXO) = O(A:B) * LR(X:O) = (2:1) * (8:1) = 16:1

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 16:1.
