To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B before seeing any cards. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B.

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
= (16/81) / (2/81)
= 16/2
= 8

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * 8
= 8

The posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
