To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the selection of either Deck A or Deck B, and the observed outcome is drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of selecting Deck A, and P(B) = 1 - P(A) be the prior probability of selecting Deck B. Let P(X|A) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck A, and P(X|B) be the probability of drawing an X from Deck B. Similarly, let P(O|A) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck A, and P(O|B) be the probability of drawing an O from Deck B.

We are given the following information:
- P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2 since the deck is chosen randomly
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

We want to find the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A given the observed outcome. To do this, we need to find the posterior probabilities P(A|X^3O^1) and P(B|X^3O^1), and then calculate the ratio P(A|X^3O^1) / P(B|X^3O^1).

The posterior probabilities are given by Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X^3O^1) = P(X^3O^1|A) * P(A) / P(X^3O^1)
P(B|X^3O^1) = P(X^3O^1|B) * P(B) / P(X^3O^1)

We can simplify the calculation by looking at the ratio of the posterior probabilities directly:

{odds: P(A|X^3O^1) / P(B|X^3O^1)}
= (P(X^3O^1|A) / P(X^3O^1|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))
= P(X^3O^1|A) / P(X^3O^1|B)

Now we need to calculate the probabilities P(X^3O^1|A) and P(X^3O^1|B).

P(X^3O^1|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 * 1/3 = 8/27
P(X^3O^1|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 * 2/3 = 2/243

Now we can find the posterior odds:

{odds: (8/27) / (2/243)}
= (8/27) / (2/243)
= 8/27 * 121.5/2
= {odds: 323/54}

So the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A are 323:54, or approximately 5.98:1.
