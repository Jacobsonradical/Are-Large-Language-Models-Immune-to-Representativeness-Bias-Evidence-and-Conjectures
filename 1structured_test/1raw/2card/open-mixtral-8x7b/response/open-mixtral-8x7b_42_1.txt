To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B before drawing any cards. Since there are no preferences initially, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of probabilities of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of choosing Deck A and P(B) as the probability of choosing Deck B.

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

Event X: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O
Event A: Drawing from Deck A
Event B: Drawing from Deck B

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio (LR) = P(X|A) / P(X|B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12/1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 12/1 = 12/1 or 12:1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 12:1.
