To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B separately, and then divide the probability of Deck A by the probability of Deck B.

Deck A probability:
P(XXXO|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Deck B probability:
P(XXXO|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(XXXO|A) / P(XXXO|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 27

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 : 1) * 27 = 27 : 1

The posterior odds are 27 : 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X.
