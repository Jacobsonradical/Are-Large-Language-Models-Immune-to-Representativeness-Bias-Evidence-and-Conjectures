To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O can be calculated as follows:
P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
P(3 X's and 1 O from A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
So, P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(A) * P(3 X's and 1 O from A) = (1/2) * (8/27) = 8/54

Similarly, the probability of selecting Deck B and drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(B) = 1/2
P(3 X's and 1 O from B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243
So, P(B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(B) * P(3 X's and 1 O from B) = (1/2) * (2/243) = 1/121.5

Now, we calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3 X's and 1 O from A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 243/3 = 81

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (8/54) * 81 = 648/54 = 11.96

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A are approximately 11.96.
