To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) is equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio. In this case, the prior odds are 1:1 since there's no reason to favor either deck before drawing cards. The likelihood ratio is calculated as the probability of drawing the observed cards from deck A divided by the probability of drawing the observed cards from deck B.

Let's calculate the likelihoods:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.2222
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0198

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood Ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 11.2245

Finally, with no prior preference for either deck, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior Odds = Likelihood Ratio ≈ 11.2245

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 11.2245:1 compared to Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 11.2245}
