To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of the two events before considering the observed evidence. Here, the two events are "selecting Deck A" and "selecting Deck B". The probabilities of these events are equal (0.5 for each) since the deck was chosen randomly. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the evidence (3 X's and 1 O) given each event. Here, the evidence is conditional on the selected deck.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, the likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
