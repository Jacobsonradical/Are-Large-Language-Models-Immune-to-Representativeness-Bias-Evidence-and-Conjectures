To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B), meaning the odds of A being selected compared to B. Since both decks have the same size, the prior odds are 1:1 or just even.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81. Therefore, the likelihood ratio is (16/81) / (2/81) = 8.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

O(A:B) = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 8:1 or simply 8.
