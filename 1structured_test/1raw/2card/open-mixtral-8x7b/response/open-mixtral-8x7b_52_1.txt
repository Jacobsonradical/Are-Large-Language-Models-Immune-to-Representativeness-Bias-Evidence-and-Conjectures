To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as XO. We want to find the posterior odds of A given XO, which is P(A|XO)/P(B|XO).

First, we need to find the prior probabilities of A and B. Since the two decks are very large and identical in all aspects except for the markings, we can assume that they are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A)=P(B)=0.5.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A, which has 2/3 of its cards marked X, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(XO|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B, which has 1/3 of its cards marked X, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(XO|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of A given XO:

P(A|XO)/P(B|XO) = [P(XO|A) \* P(A)] / [P(XO|B) \* P(B)]
= (16/81) \* (1/2) / (2/81) \* (1/2)
= 16/2
= 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
