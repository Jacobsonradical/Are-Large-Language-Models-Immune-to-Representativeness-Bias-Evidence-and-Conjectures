To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) is equal to the prior odds times the likelihood ratio.

Let H1 be the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and H2 be the hypothesis that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of probabilities of drawing 4 cards from Deck A and Deck B, which is:

P(H1) / P(H2) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O under each hypothesis is:

P(3 X's and 1 O | H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(3 X's and 1 O | H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3 X's and 1 O | H1) / P(3 X's and 1 O | H2) = (8/27) / (8/27) = 1

Finally, the posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 8/1 * 1 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
