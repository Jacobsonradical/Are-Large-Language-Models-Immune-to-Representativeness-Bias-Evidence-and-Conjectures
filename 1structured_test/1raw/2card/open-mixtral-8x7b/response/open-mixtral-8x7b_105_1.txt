To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's first calculate the prior probabilities:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since we choose either deck A or B with equal probability)

Next, we'll calculate the likelihoods. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can find the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(A) * L(A) / (P(A) * L(A) + P(B) * L(B))
= (1/2) * (8/27) / ((1/2) * (8/27) + (1/2) * (2/243))
= 108 / (108 + 2)
= 108 / 110

Similarly, we can find the posterior probability for deck B:

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(B) * L(B) / (P(A) * L(A) + P(B) * L(B))
= (1/2) * (2/243) / ((1/2) * (8/27) + (1/2) * (2/243))
= 2 / 110

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
= (108 / 110) / (2 / 110)
= 108 / 2
= 54

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 54:1.

{odds: 54}
