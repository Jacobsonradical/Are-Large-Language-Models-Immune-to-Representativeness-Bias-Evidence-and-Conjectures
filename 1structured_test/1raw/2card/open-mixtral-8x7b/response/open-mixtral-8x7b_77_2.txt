To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probability and the likelihood for each deck.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: 0.5
- Probability of selecting Deck B: 0.5

Likelihoods (given that 3 cards are X and 1 card is O):
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (prior probability of A * likelihood of A) / (prior probability of B * likelihood of B)
= (0.5 * 8/27) / (0.5 * 2/243)
= 486/2
= 243

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 243.
