To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In our case, the two events are selecting deck A or B, and drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of selecting deck A, and P(B) be the prior probability of selecting deck B (given that one of the decks is chosen randomly, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5).

Let P(X|A) be the probability of drawing an X from deck A, and P(X|B) be the probability of drawing an X from deck B; similarly, let P(O|A) and P(O|B) be the probabilities of drawing an O from decks A and B, respectively. We are given that P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3, P(X|B) = 1/3, and P(O|B) = 2/3.

Let P(3X, 1O|A) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, and P(3X, 1O|B) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O), which we can express as:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) \* P(A) / P(3X, 1O|B) \* P(B)

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the binomial probability mass function, since the number of X's and O's we draw from each deck is a binomial random variable.

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(4, 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1, where C(4, 3) is the number of combinations of 4 items taken 3 at a time, which is equal to 4.

P(3X, 1O|B) = C(4, 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

posterior odds = (4 \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 0.5) / (4 \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 0.5)
= (2^3 \* 1) / (1 \* 2^3)
= 8 / 8
= 1

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to deck B (where most cards are marked O) are {odds: 1}. This means that, given the information provided, the probability of the 4 cards coming from deck A is the same as the probability of them coming from deck B.
