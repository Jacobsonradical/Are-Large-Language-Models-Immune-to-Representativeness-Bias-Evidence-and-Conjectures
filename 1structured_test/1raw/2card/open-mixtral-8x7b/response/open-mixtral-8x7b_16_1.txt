To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the two decks being selected, which is 1:1 or just 1 since we have no reason to prefer one deck over the other before seeing any cards.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from Deck A and the same probabilities given that we drew from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

The posterior odds are then the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, but since the prior odds are 1, they don't change the result:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4:1 or simply 4.
