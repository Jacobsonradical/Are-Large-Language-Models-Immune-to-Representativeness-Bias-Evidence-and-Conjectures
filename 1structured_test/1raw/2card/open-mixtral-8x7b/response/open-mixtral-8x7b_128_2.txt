To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before looking at the cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's compute the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 2/81

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 8/27 * 81/2 = 32

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 32 = 32

Hence, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 32}
