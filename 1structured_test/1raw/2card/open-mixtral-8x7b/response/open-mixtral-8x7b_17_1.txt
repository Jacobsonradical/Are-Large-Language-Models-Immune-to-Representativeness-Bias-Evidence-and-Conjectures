To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the selection of Deck A and the observation of 3 X's and 1 O in the 4 cards drawn.

Let A be the event of selecting Deck A, and B be the event of selecting Deck B. We want to find P(A|X=3,O=1), the probability of having selected Deck A given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|X=3,O=1) = P(X=3,O=1|A) * P(A) / P(X=3,O=1)

First, let's find P(X=3,O=1|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, this probability is given by the combination formula:

P(X=3,O=1|A) = (42 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 420/27 = 15.5556

Similarly, we can find P(X=3,O=1|B), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(X=3,O=1|B) = (66 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8505/6561 = 1.3265
