To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A is the same as choosing Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio: We want to know how much more likely it is that we'd get this result (3 Xs and 1 O) from Deck A compared to Deck B. To calculate this, we can use the formula:

P(3 X, 1 O | A) / P(3 X, 1 O | B)

First, let's find P(3 X, 1 O | A):
- Number of ways to pick 3 Xs from 2/3 of the deck = C(2n/3, 3)
- Number of ways to pick 1 O from 1/3 of the deck = C(n/3, 1)
- So, P(3 X, 1 O | A) = C(2n/3, 3) \* C(n/3, 1) / C(n, 4)

Similarly, we can find P(3 X, 1 O | B):
- Number of ways to pick 3 Xs from 1/3 of the deck = C(n/3, 3)
- Number of ways to pick 1 O from 2/3 of the deck = C(2n/3, 1)
- So, P(3 X, 1 O | B) = C(n/3, 3) \* C(2n/3, 1) / C(n, 4)

Finally, the likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3 X, 1 O | A) / P(3 X, 1 O | B)

After calculating the likelihood ratio and multiplying it by the prior odds, we get the posterior odds. Unfortunately, we don't know the exact value of n, so we can't provide a specific numerical answer. However, you can calculate the posterior odds for a specific value of n using the formulas provided above.
