To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let A represent the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck A, and X represent the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We want to find the posterior odds of A given X, which is P(A|X)/P(B|X).

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
- P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4C3 (combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from A)
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4C3 (combinations of choosing 3 X's and 1 O from B)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
- P(A|X) = P(A) * P(X|A) / (P(A) * P(X|A) + P(B) * P(X|B))
- P(B|X) = P(B) * P(X|B) / (P(A) * P(X|A) + P(B) * P(X|B))

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:
odds = P(A|X)/P(B|X)

After calculating the above expression, we get:
{odds: 2}

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2:1.
