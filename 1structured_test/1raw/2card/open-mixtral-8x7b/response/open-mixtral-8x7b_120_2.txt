To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, divided by the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27
P(3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2 = 4

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 0.5 * 4 = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is {odds: 2}.
