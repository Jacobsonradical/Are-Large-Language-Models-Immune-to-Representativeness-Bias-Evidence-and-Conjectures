To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Let's assume that both decks have an equal probability of being selected, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Now let's find the likelihood ratio.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
(2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = L(A|X) / L(B|X) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

{odds: 8}
