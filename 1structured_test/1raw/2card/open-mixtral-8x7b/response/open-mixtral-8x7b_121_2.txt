To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
P(A) = 1/2 (both decks have an equal chance of being selected)
P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:
odds(A:B) = P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. We want to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we drew from decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

We're given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, and we want to find the likelihood ratio between these probabilities.

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

To simplify the problem, let's assume that both decks have a large number of cards (N), which allows us to approximate the combinations using the normal distribution (this is known as the De Moivre-Laplace theorem).

P(3X, 1O | A) ≈ (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3) / N^4
P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3) / N^4

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio ≈ ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
Likelihood ratio ≈ 8

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1 : 1) * 8
Posteriod odds = 8 : 1

The posterior odds of having drawn 4 cards from deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 are marked O, are 8:1 compared to deck B.
