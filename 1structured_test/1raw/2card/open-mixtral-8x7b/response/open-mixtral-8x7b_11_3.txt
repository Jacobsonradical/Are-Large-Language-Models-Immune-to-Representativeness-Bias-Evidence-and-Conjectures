To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or Deck B before seeing the cards. We have no reason to prefer one deck over the other, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

1. Deck A: 2/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 2/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 2/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 1/3 (probability of drawing an O) = 16/81
2. Deck B: 1/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 1/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 1/3 (probability of drawing an X) * 2/3 (probability of drawing an O) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = L(A|X3O1) / L(B|X3O1) = (16/81) / (2/81) = 16/2 = 8

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 8:1 or simply 8.
