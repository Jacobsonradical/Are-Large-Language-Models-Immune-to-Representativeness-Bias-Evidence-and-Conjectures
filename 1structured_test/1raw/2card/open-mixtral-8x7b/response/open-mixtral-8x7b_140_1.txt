To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B represents the observed event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|B) / P(not A|B).

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(not A). Since both decks have the same number of cards, the prior probabilities are equal:

P(A) = P(not A) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods P(B|A) and P(B|not A). 

The likelihood P(B|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. This can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3) = 16/81

The likelihood P(B|not A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. This can be calculated as:

P(B|not A) = (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|B) / P(not A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (16/81) * (1/2) / (2/81) * (1/2) = 16/4 = 4

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
