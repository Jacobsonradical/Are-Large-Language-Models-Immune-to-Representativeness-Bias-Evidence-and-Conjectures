To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the two events before any evidence is taken into account, and the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the evidence given each event.

The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are both equal to 1/2 since the decks are chosen randomly. 

Now, let's compute the likelihoods of drawing three X's and one O card from Deck A and Deck B separately. 

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X, the probability of drawing three X's and one O card is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B, where only 1/3 of the cards are marked X, the probability of drawing three X's and one O card is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, compute the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (16/81) / (2/27) = 16 / 2 = 8

Finally, multiply the prior odds with the likelihood ratio to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = (1/2) * 8 = 4

So, the posterior odds are 4. This means that, after observing the evidence of drawing three X's and one O card, it is 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 4}
