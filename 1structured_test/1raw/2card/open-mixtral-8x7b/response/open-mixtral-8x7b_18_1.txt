To solve this problem, we will use the Bayes' theorem, which is a formula in probability theory for determining conditional probability. In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of having drawn the cards from deck A compared to deck B.

Let's first calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability of choosing deck A: P(A) = 1/2
- Probability of choosing deck B: P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A: P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B: P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:
- P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
- P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

To calculate the posterior odds, we need to divide the posterior probabilities:
- Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

We already have all the components calculated:
- P(3X, 1O | A) = 16/81
- P(3X, 1O | B) = 2/81
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the normalization constant, P(3X, 1O), which is the sum of the products of the likelihoods and the prior probabilities:
- P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)
- P(3X, 1O) = (16/81)*(1/2) + (2/81)*(1/2) = 18/162

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities:
- P(A | 3X, 1O) = (16/81)*(1/2) / (18/162) = 16/18
- P(B | 3X, 1O) = (2/81)*(1/2) / (18/162) = 2/18

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
{odds: 16/2}
This means that the odds of having drawn the cards from deck A are 8 times higher than from deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.
