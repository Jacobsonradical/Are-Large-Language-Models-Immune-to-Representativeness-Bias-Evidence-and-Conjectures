To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's start by finding the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2
- The probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2

Next, let's find the likelihoods:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4), where N is the total number of cards in the deck.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

We are interested in the ratio of these likelihoods, which simplifies to:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:
Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
Posterior Odds = (1/2) / (1/2) * 8 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
