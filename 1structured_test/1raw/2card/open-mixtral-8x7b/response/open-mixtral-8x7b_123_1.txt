To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / [P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B)]

In this case:
- P(A|X) is the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed evidence (3 X's and 1 O).
- P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.
- P(A) is the prior probability that Deck A was selected, which is 1/2 since the decks were chosen randomly.
- P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27.
- P(B) is the prior probability that Deck B was selected, which is 1/2 since the decks were chosen randomly.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Substitute the values:

Posterior odds = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(2/27) * (1/2)]

Simplify:

Posteriod odds = 8/2 = 4

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

{odds: 4}
