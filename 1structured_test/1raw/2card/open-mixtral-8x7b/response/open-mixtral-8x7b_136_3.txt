To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of choosing Deck B is also 1/2. The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio:
Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Likelihood ratio L = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2^3 / 3^3) / (2 / 3^4) = (2^2 / 3^2) = 4/9

Posterior odds:
Finally, to find the posterior odds, multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (4/9) = 4/9

In the format requested, the answer is:
{odds: 4/9}
