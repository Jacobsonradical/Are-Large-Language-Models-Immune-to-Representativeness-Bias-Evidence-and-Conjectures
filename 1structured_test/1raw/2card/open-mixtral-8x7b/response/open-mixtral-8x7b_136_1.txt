To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as selecting Deck B, so the prior odds are 1:1 or just 1.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B, and use these probabilities to calculate the likelihood ratio.

Deck A:
P(3X, 1O in Deck A) = P(X) * P(X) * P(X) * P(O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.296

Deck B:
P(3X, 1O in Deck B) = P(X) * P(X) * P(X) * P(O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.027

Now calculate the likelihood ratio using these probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O in Deck A) / P(3X, 1O in Deck B) ≈ 0.296 / 0.027 ≈ 11

Finally, calculate the posterior odds using the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 11 ≈ 11

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 11.
