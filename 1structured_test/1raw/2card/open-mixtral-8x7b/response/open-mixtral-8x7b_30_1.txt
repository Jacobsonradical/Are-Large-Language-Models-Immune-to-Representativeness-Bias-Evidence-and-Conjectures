To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
We have no information suggesting that one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other, so we assume equal probabilities for both:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2
Thus, the prior odds are:
prior_odds = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio. We know that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O. The likelihood of observing this outcome depends on whether the deck is A or B:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:
likelihood_ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Substituting the values, we get:
likelihood_ratio = (8/27) / (8/243) = 27/3

Finally, we calculate the posterior odds using the prior odds and likelihood ratio:
posterior_odds = prior_odds * likelihood_ratio

posterior_odds = 1 * (27/3)
posterior_odds = 9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 9. This means that, after observing the outcome (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A is now 9 times greater than the probability of them being drawn from Deck B.

{odds: 9}
