To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: What is the probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards? There are two decks, so the prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2.

Likelihood ratio: We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O if we select Deck A and Deck B, and then divide them. We are given that the probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3. Similarly, the probability of drawing an O from Deck A is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O from Deck B is 2/3.

* Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) \* 4! / (3! \* 1!) = 8/9
* Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) \* 4! / (3! \* 1!) = 2/27

Likelihood ratio = Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A / Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = 8/9 / 2/27 = 12/1

Posterior odds: Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio = (1/2) \* (12/1) = 12/2 = 6

{odds: 6}
