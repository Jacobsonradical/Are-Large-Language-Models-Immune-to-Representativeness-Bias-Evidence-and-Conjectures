To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Since the decks are very large and identical except for the markings, we can assume that the probability of selecting either deck is equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

So, the prior odds are:
{odds: 1/1 or 1}

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. We want to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324 / 4

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= (1) * (324/4)
= 81

{odds: 81}

The posterior odds are 81:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A. This indicates that, given the observed outcome, it is highly likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with a higher proportion of cards marked X.
