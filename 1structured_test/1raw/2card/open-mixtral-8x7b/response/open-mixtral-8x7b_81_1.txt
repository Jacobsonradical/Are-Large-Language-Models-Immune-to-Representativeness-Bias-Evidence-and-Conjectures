To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the prior probabilities as follows:

P(A) = P(selecting Deck A) = 1/2
P(B) = P(selecting Deck B) = 1/2

Let's also denote the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn from decks A and B:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

The posterior odds are then:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

Substituting the values we get:

odds = ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2) ) / ( (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2) )

Simplifying:

odds = (2^3 * 3) / (1^3 * 1) = 24

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 24:1.

Answer: {odds: 24}
