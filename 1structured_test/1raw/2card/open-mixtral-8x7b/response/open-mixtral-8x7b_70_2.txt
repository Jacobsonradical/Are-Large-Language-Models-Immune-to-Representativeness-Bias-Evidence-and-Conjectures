To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (1/2) since the decks are chosen by chance. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and given Deck B.

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = 8/27 / 2/243 = 27

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 27 = 13.5

{odds: 13.5}
