To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. 

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of selecting each deck:

P(A) = 1/2 (both decks are equally likely to be selected)
P(B) = 1/2

So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio.  The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is the likelihood of the data given Deck A divided by the likelihood of the data given Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 16/2 = 8

Finally, the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1/2) * 8 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 4.
