To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, and then multiply them together.

Prior odds for Deck A: 1 (both decks are equally likely to be chosen at the beginning)

Likelihood ratio:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = (8/27) / (2/243) = 324/54 â‰ˆ 6

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 6 = 6

{odds: 6}
