To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is also 1/2, so the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4)

where N is the total number of cards in each deck. Since N is very large, we can simplify the likelihood ratio by considering only the probabilities of drawing X's and O's:

LR = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2^3 * 3^2) / (3^3 * 2) = 8:1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (8:1) = 8:1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1 compared to Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 8}
