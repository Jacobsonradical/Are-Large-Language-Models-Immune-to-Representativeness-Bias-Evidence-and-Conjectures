To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds:
The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of choosing Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio:
Let's assume that we have chosen Deck A. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is the probability of the evidence given Deck A divided by the probability of the evidence given Deck B:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Posterior odds:
Finally, the posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4.
