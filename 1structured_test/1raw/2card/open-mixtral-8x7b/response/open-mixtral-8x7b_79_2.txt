To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: The ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B.

1. For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = P(X)³ \* P(O) = (2/3)³ \* (1/3) ≈ 0.26

2. For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = P(X) \* P(X) \* P(X) \* P(O|X) = (1/3) \* (1/3) \* (1/3) \* (1/3) ≈ 0.01

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) ≈ 26

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio = 0.5 \* 26 = 13

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 13.
