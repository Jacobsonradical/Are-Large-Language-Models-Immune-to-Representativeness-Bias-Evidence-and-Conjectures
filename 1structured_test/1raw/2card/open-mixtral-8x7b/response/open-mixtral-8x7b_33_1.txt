To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of the deck being A versus B, given that we've observed 3 X's and 1 O. 

Let A and B be the events that the deck is A or B, respectively, and let X and O be the events of drawing an X or O card, respectively. What we want to find is P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO), the posterior odds.

First, let's find P(XXXO), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, regardless of the deck. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to order the cards, and since there are 3 X's and 1 O, there are 4 ways to arrange them: XXXO. Therefore, P(XXXO) = 4/((2/3)^3 * 1/3) = 81/2 for Deck A, and 4/((1/3)^3 * 2/3) = 108/7 for Deck B.

Next, we'll find P(XXXO|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards are X's, and 1/3 are O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 \* (1/3). So, P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27.

Similarly, P(XXXO|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards are X's, and 2/3 are O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 \* (2/3). So, P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243.

Now we can calculate P(A|XXXO) and P(B|XXXO) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) \* P(A) / P(XXXO) = (8/27) \* (1/2) / (81/2)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) \* P(B) / P(XXXO) = (2/243) \* (1/2) / (108/7)

Finally, we can compute the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO) = ((8/27) \* (1/2) / (81/2)) / ((2/243) \* (1/2) / (108/7))

The posterior odds are:
{odds: 1458/4}

In other words, the odds favor Deck A by a factor of 1458 to 4.
