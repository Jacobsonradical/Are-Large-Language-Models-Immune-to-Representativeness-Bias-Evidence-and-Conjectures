To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A or B before seeing the drawn cards is 1:1 since we have no information about the selection.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we've drawn from Decks A and B.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3) * (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 4) = 64/2187

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 4) * (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3) = 128/19683

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (64/2187) / (128/19683) = 95/14

Finally, multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = 1 * (95/14) = 95/14 â‰ˆ 6.79 (rounded to two decimal places)

{odds: 6.79}
