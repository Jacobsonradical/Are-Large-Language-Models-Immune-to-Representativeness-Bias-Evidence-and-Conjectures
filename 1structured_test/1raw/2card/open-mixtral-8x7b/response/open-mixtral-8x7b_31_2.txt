To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 / 2/243 = 729/54

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 729/54 = 13.5

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 13.5.
