To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's start by calculating the prior probabilities. Since we don't know which deck was selected, we can assume that there is an equal probability of selecting either deck, so:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods for each deck. We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 2/3 of the cards in deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, and 1/3 of the cards in deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.

For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1

For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) / [P(3X, 1O | A) \* P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) \* P(B)]

Substituting in the values we calculated above, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 1/2 / [(2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 \* 1/2 + (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 \* 1/2]

Simplifying, we get:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = 8 / (8 + 2) = 8 / 10 = 0.8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are:

odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = 0.8 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are 4:1.
