To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are selecting Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck. Let's denote these events as follows:

A: Deck A is selected
B: Deck B is selected
X: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|X), the probability of selecting Deck A given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O. To calculate this, we need to know the following quantities:

1. P(A): The probability of selecting Deck A, which is 1/2 since the decks are chosen randomly.
2. P(X|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
3. P(B): The probability of selecting Deck B, which is also 1/2.
4. P(X|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probabilities using combinations:

P(X|A) = C(2/3*52, 3) * C(1/3*52, 1) / C(52, 4) = (32760 * 169) / 270725 = 5591616 / 270725 ≈ 20.65

P(X|B) = C(1/3*52, 3) * C(2/3*52, 1) / C(52, 4) = (2330 * 688) / 270725 ≈ 0.66

Now we can compute P(A|X) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B))
P(A|X) = (5591616 / 270725) * (1/2) / ((5591616 / 270725) * (1/2) + (0.66 * 1/2))
P(A|X) ≈ 0.965

The posterior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the events, so we can calculate the odds as:

{odds: 96.5}
