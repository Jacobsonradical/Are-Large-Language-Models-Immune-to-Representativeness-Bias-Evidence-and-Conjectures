To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and the prior probability of choosing Deck B is also 1/2. Therefore, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O if we draw 4 cards from Deck A versus drawing the same from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3 * 4, 3) * C(1/3 * 4, 1) / C(4, 4) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 4) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 4

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3 * 4, 3) * C(2/3 * 4, 1) / C(4, 4) = (1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 4) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 12

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 4/12 = 1/3

Posterior odds: The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds with the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (1/3) = 1/3

{odds: 1/3}
