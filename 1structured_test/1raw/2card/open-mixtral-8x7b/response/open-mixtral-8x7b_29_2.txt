To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that we know 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O. We can express this as:

P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)

Let's first find the prior probabilities, P(A) and P(B):
- P(A) = 1/2, since either deck A or B is equally likely to be chosen
- P(B) = 1/2

Next, let's find the likelihoods, P(X=3, O=1|A) and P(X=3, O=1|B):
- P(X=3, O=1|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) × C(12, 4), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. This is because there are C(12, 4) ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 12 X's and 6 O's.
- P(X=3, O=1|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) × C(18, 4), where C(18, 4) is the number of combinations of 18 items taken 4 at a time. This is because there are C(18, 4) ways to choose 4 cards from a deck of 6 X's and 18 O's.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) × P(A) / P(X=3, O=1)
P(B|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|B) × P(B) / P(X=3, O=1)

The posterior odds are then given by:

odds = P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)

Calculating the above values, we get:

odds ≈ 2.29

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are approximately 2.29.
