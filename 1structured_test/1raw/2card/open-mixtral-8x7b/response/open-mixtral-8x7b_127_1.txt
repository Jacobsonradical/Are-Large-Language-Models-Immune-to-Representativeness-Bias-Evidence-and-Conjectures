To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's define some events:
- A: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find P(A|X), the probability of A given X.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X).

We know that P(X|A) = 1/({4 choose 3}) = 1/4, because if we draw 4 cards from Deck A (where 2/3 are marked X), the probability of getting 3 X's is 1/4.

Similarly, P(X|B) = 1/({4 choose 3}) = 1/4, because if we draw 4 cards from Deck B (where 1/3 are marked X), the probability of getting 3 X's is also 1/4.

We're looking for the posterior odds, which are given by P(A|X)/P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|B) * P(B)).

We don't have the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), but they cancel out in the odds, so we don't need to know them.

The likelihood ratio is P(X|A)/P(X|B) = 1/4 / 1/4 = 1.

Therefore, the posterior odds are 1, meaning that the cards are equally likely to have come from Deck A or Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 1}
