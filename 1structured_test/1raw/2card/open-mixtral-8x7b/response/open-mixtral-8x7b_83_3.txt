To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O without knowing the deck's composition. The probability of choosing Deck A is 1/2, and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243. The prior odds are then:

Prior odds = P(A) * P(3X, 1O|A) / P(B) * P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/2) * (8/27) / ((1/2) * (2/243)) = 32 / 1 = 32

Likelihood ratio: The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 32

Posterior odds: The updated odds after observing the data.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 32 * 32 = 1024

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 1024.
