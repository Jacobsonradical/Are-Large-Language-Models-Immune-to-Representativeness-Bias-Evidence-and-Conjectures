To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O in Deck A, divided by the probability of selecting Deck B and drawing 3 X's and 1 O in Deck B.

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(3X,1O in A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O in B) * P(B)]

Let's calculate the terms individually:

P(3X,1O in A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O in B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (by assumption)

Now, we can calculate the prior odds:

Prior odds = (8/27) * (1/2) / (2/243) * (1/2) = 8/27 * 121.5/2 = 324/54 = 6^3 / 3^3 * 2

Next, we'll calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the probability of the data given Deck A divided by the probability of the data given Deck B.

Likelihood ratio = P(3X,1O in A) / P(3X,1O in B) = 8/27 / 2/243 = 8/27 * 243/2 = 9

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 6^3 / 3^3 * 2 * 9 = 6^3 * 3^2 * 2 = 6^5

{odds: 6^5}
