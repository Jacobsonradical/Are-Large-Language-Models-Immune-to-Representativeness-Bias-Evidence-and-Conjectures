To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "selecting deck A" and "selecting deck B", and we are interested in the probability of each given that we have observed 3 X's and 1 O in a sample of 4 cards.

Let A and B be the events of selecting deck A and deck B, respectively, and let X and O be the events of drawing a card marked X and O, respectively. Then, using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A | X(3)O(1)) = P(X(3)O(1) | A) \* P(A) / P(X(3)O(1))

P(B | X(3)O(1)) = P(X(3)O(1) | B) \* P(B) / P(X(3)O(1))

To calculate these probabilities, we need to know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), which are the probabilities of selecting each deck before any cards are drawn. Since the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods P(X(3)O(1) | A) and P(X(3)O(1) | B), which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have selected each deck.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(X(3)O(1) | A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(X(3)O(1) | B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 2/243

Finally, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from either deck, which is the sum of the two likelihoods weighted by the prior probabilities:

P(X(3)O(1)) = P(X(3)O(1) | A) \* P(A) + P(X(3)O(1) | B) \* P(B)

P(X(3)O(1)) = (8/27) \* (1/2) + (2/243) \* (1/2) = 46/486

Now we can calculate the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from deck A versus deck B:

posterior odds = P(A | X(3)O(1)) / P(B | X(3)O(1))

posterior odds = (8/27) \* (1/2) / (2/243) \* (1/2)

posterior odds = 81 / 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is {odds: 81/2}.
