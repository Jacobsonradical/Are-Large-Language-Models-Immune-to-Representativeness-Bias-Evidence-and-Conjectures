To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)
Since the decks are very large, we can assume that the probability of selecting either deck is equal, so:
Prior odds = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, given that 2/3 of the cards in deck A are X's and 1/3 are O's, while 1/3 of the cards in deck B are X's and 2/3 are O's.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.2222
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0139

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 15.92

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = (1/2) * 15.92 ≈ 7.96

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 7.96.
