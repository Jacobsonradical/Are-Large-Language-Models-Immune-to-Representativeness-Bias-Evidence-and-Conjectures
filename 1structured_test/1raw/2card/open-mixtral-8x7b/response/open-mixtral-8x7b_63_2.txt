To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A is the same as the probability of selecting Deck B, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = 16/81 / 2/81 = 8

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 0.5 * 8 = 4

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4.
