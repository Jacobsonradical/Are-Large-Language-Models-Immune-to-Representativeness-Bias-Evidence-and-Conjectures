To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are selecting Deck A and drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

Let A be the event of selecting Deck A, and B be the event of selecting Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds of A given the observed outcome, which is drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) * P(A) / P(X=3, O=1)

We want to find the odds of A over B, which is:

Odds(A:B|X=3, O=1) = P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)

Since the selection of the deck is random, the prior probabilities of A and B are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's find the likelihood probabilities P(X=3, O=1|A) and P(X=3, O=1|B).

In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(X=3, O=1|A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3)

In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(X=3, O=1|B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)

Next, we compute the joint probability P(X=3, O=1) as:

P(X=3, O=1) = P(X=3, O=1|A) * P(A) + P(X=3, O=1|B) * P(B)

Finally, we compute the posterior odds:

Odds(A:B|X=3, O=1) = P(A|X=3, O=1) / P(B|X=3, O=1)
= P(X=3, O=1|A) * P(A) / P(X=3, O=1|B) * P(B)
= P(X=3, O=1|A) / P(X=3, O=1|B)

Now, substitute the likelihood probabilities:

Odds(A:B|X=3, O=1) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
= 2^3 / 1
= 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of having drawn the 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, are 8:1.

The answer is:

{odds: 8}
