To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of choosing Deck A and Deck B are equal, so the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B. 

- Deck A has 2/3 probability of X and 1/3 probability of O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.
- Deck B has 1/3 probability of X and 2/3 probability of O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27.

The likelihood ratio is the probability of Deck A's data divided by the probability of Deck B's data, i.e., (8/27) / (2/27) = 4.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4.

In the requested format, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
