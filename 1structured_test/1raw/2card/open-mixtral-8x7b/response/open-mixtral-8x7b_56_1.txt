To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before looking at the cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior_Odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1

Now, let's find the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

LR_A = ((2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3)) = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

LR_B = ((1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:

LR = LR_A / LR_B = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Finally, the posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior_Odds = Prior_Odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are:

{odds: 4}
