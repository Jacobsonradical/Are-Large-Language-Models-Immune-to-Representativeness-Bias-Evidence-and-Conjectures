To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (1/2) since the choice of deck is made at random.

Next, we compute the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B.

Let P(A) be the probability of selecting Deck A, P(B) = 1 - P(A), and P(X|A) and P(O|A) be the probabilities of drawing an X or an O from Deck A, and similarly for Deck B. We are given P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3, P(X|B) = 1/3, and P(O|B) = 2/3.

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(4,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) = 4 \* (8/81) = 32/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(4,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3) = 4 \* (2/27) = 8/27

The likelihood ratio is then:
LR = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B) = (32/81) / (8/27) = 16/3

Finally, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * LR = (1/2) * (16/3) = 8/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8/3.
