To solve this problem, we'll first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, then use these probabilities to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote the number of cards in each deck as n (n >> 4). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3) / n^4

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3) / n^4

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

posterior_odds = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

posterior_odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)]

posterior_odds = [(2/3)^4 / (1/3)^4] = 256/1

{odds: 256}
