To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A in relation to B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, let's find the prior probabilities of A and B:
- P(A) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks)
- P(B) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X:
- P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X:
- P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

- P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) * P(A) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
- P(B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | B) * P(B) / P(3 X's and 1 O)

We can simplify the calculation by finding the ratio of the posterior probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds:

odds = P(A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(B | 3 X's and 1 O)

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out some terms:

odds = [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]

Calculating the cube and the square, we get:

odds = (4/9) / (1/9)

Finally, to express the odds as a single number, we divide the probabilities:

odds = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
