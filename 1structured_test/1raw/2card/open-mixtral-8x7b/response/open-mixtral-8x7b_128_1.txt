To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Likelihood ratio: We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn from Deck A, and divide it by the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that we have drawn from Deck B.

Likelihood(A) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) / (total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck A)
= (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3 * 4C1) / (44/3)
= (128/19683) / (44/3)

Likelihood(B) = (number of ways to choose 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) / (total number of ways to draw 4 cards from Deck B)
= (1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 4C1) / (22/3)
= (8/6561) / (22/3)

Likelihood ratio = Likelihood(A) / Likelihood(B) = (128/19683) * (3/22) / (8/6561) * (3/44) = 27/4

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1 : 1) * (27 : 4) = 27 : 4

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 27:4.
