To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, we need to determine the prior odds. Since there are no preferences given in the problem statement about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we'll assume a uniform distribution, meaning that there's a 50% chance of selecting either deck. Thus, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio. We know that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O in the sample. We need to determine the probability of this happening, given that Deck A or Deck B was selected.

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.2963
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0278

The likelihood ratio is then:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 10.67

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 10.67 ≈ 10.67

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 10.67 compared to Deck B.

{odds: 10.67}
