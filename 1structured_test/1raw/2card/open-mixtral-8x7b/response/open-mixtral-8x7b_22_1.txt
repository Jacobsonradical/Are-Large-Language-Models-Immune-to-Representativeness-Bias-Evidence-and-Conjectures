To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the prior odds as O(A:B), the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A as L(X|A), and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B as L(X|B). We want to find the posterior odds O(A:B|X).

First, we need to calculate the prior odds O(A:B). Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods L(X|A) and L(X|B).

In deck A, there are 2/3 probability of drawing an X and 1/3 probability of drawing an O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

L(X|A) = C(12,3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 + C(12,1) \* C(11,2) \* (2/3)^1 \* (2/3)^2 \* (1/3)^2
= 220/2187 + 132/729
= 352/2187

In deck B, there are 1/3 probability of drawing an X and 2/3 probability of drawing an O. So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

L(X|B) = C(16,3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 + C(16,1) \* C(13,2) \* (1/3)^1 \* (2/3)^2 \* (1/3)^2
= 560/6561 + 416/729
= 976/6561

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds O(A:B|X) = O(A:B) \* L(X|A) / L(X|B) = 1 \* (352/2187) / (976/6561) = 2112/976.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2112:976}.
