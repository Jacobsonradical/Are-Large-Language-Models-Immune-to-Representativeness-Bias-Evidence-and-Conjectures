To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, which are equal (since the decks are equally likely to be chosen). So, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Now let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4/81

The likelihood ratio is then the likelihood of the evidence given Deck A divided by the likelihood of the evidence given Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 * 81/4 = 64/1

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 64/1 = 64

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 64:1 compared to Deck B.
