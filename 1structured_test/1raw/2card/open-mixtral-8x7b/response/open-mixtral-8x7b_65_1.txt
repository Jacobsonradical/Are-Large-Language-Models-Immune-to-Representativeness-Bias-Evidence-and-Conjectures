To find the answer, we first need to calculate the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, and then use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting Deck A: 1/2
- Probability of selecting Deck B: 1/2

Likelihoods:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) = 16/81
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/81

Posterior odds:
odds = (prior odds * likelihood of A) / (prior odds * likelihood of B)
= ((1/2) * (16/81)) / ((1/2) * (2/81))
= 16/2
= 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8.
