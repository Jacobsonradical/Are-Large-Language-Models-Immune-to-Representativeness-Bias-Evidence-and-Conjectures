To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's find the prior odds. Since the two decks are very large, the fact that 4 cards were drawn doesn't affect the proportion of decks A and B. So, the prior odds are simply the ratio of the number of ways to choose deck A to the number of ways to choose deck B:

prior odds = 1 (since there are only two decks)

Next, let's find the likelihood ratio. We'll use the fact that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O. The likelihood of this happening if the 4 cards were drawn from deck A is:

P(3 X, 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1

The likelihood of this happening if the 4 cards were drawn from deck B is:

P(3 X, 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is then the ratio of these two probabilities:

likelihood ratio = P(3 X, 1 O | A) / P(3 X, 1 O | B) = (2/3)^2 × (1/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 × (2/3)^2 = 1

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio = 1 × 1 = 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are:

{odds: 1}
