To find the posterior odds, we first need to determine the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The probability of selecting Deck A before seeing any cards is 1/2, and the probability of selecting Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

Prior odds = P(A)/P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's determine the likelihood ratio. We want to find the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O from A) / P(3 X's and 1 O from B) = 8/27 * 131/2 = 524/54

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (524/54) = 524/54

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, where most cards are marked O, are 524:54.

{odds: 524/54}
