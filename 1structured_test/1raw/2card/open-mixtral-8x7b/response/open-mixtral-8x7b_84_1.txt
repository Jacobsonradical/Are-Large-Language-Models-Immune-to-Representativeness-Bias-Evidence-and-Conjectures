To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities for selecting decks A and B:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks are selected randomly)

Next, let's determine the likelihoods for observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards were drawn from decks A and B. We'll use the hypergeometric distribution to calculate these probabilities.

- P(3X, 1O | A) = (10 choose 3) * (26 choose 1) / (56 choose 4) ≈ 0.345
- P(3X, 1O | B) = (17 choose 3) * (39 choose 1) / (56 choose 4) ≈ 0.142

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:
- LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) ≈ 0.345 / 0.142 ≈ 2.43

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
- Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio = (1/2) * 2.43 ≈ 1.22

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are approximately 1.22. This means that, given the observed data, it is slightly more likely that the cards came from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) than from Deck B (where most cards are marked O). However, this difference is not very large, indicating that the data does not provide strong evidence for which deck the cards came from.
