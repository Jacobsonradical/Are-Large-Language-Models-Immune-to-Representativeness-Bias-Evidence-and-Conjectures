To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let A represent the event of drawing 4 cards from Deck A, and B represent the observed event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O. We want to find the odds of A given B, which is:

odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(not A|B)

First, we need to find the prior probabilities, P(A) and P(not A). Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior probabilities are:

P(A) = P(not A) = 1/2

Next, we need to find the likelihoods, P(B|A) and P(B|not A). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(B|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(B|not A) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (8/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27) * (1/2) + (2/27) * (1/2)] = 8/10

P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (2/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27) * (1/2) + (2/27) * (1/2)] = 2/10

Finally, we can find the odds of A given B:

odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(not A|B) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4

So, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given the observed outcome, are 4:1 or simply 4.
