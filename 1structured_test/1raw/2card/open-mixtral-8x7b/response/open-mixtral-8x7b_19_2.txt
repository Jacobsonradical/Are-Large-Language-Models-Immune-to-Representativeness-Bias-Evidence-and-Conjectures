To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of having drawn the cards from deck A compared to deck B, given that we have 3 X's and 1 O.

Let A and B be the events of drawing from deck A and deck B respectively. Let X3O1 be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to find P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1), which are the posterior probabilities of drawing from deck A and deck B given the observed outcome X3O1.

Bayes' theorem will help us to find these posterior probabilities:

P(A|X3O1) = P(X3O1|A) * P(A) / P(X3O1)
P(B|X3O1) = P(X3O1|B) * P(B) / P(X3O1)

To find the posterior odds, we can divide these two equations:

(P(A|X3O1) / P(B|X3O1)) = (P(X3O1|A) * P(A)) / (P(X3O1|B) * P(B))

Now, let's find the terms for this equation:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since there are only two decks and we choose one randomly)

P(X3O1|A) = C(2/3N, 3) * C(1/3N, 1) / C(N, 4) (combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
P(X3O1|B) = C(1/3N, 3) * C(2/3N, 1) / C(N, 4) (combinations of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

Here, N is the total number of cards in each deck, and C(a, b) denotes the number of combinations of choosing b items from a items set.

Since the number of cards is very large, we can approximate the probabilities as follows:

P(X3O1|A) ≈ (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * N^4 / N!
P(X3O1|B) ≈ (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * N^4 / N!

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds = (P(X3O1|A) / P(X3O1|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))
odds ≈ ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))) * (1/2 / 1/2)
odds ≈ (8 / 2)

{odds: 4}

So, the posterior odds of having drawn the cards from deck A is 4 times higher than that of deck B.
