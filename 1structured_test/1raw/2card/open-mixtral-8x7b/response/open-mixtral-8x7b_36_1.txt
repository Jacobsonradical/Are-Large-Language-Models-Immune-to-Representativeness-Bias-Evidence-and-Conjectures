To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of two hypotheses (H1 and H2) given some observed evidence (E) is equal to the prior odds of those hypotheses multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the evidence given the two hypotheses:

posterior odds(H1:H2|E) = prior odds(H1:H2) × likelihood ratio(E|H1):(E|H2)

In this case, our hypotheses are that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (H1) or Deck B (H2). The evidence is that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O. We want to find the posterior odds of H1 and H2 given this evidence.

First, let's calculate the prior odds of H1 and H2. Since the two decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are simply 1:1 or just 1.

Next, we'll calculate the likelihood ratio of the evidence given the two hypotheses. We need to find the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the 4 cards came from Deck A, and divide that by the probability of observing the same evidence given that the 4 cards came from Deck B.

Let's calculate the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. There are 2/3 chance of drawing an X and 1/3 chance of drawing an O. So the probability of this specific sequence (XXXO) is:

P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 8/27

Now let's calculate the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. That probability is:

P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 2/27

The likelihood ratio is then:

likelihood ratio = P(XXXO|A) : P(XXXO|B) = 8/27 : 2/27 = 4:1

Finally, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds:

posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio = 1 × 4:1 = 4:1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4:1.
