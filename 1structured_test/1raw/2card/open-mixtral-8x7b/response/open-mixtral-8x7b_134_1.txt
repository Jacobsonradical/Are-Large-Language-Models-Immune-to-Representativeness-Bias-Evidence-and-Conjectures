To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: The prior probability of selecting Deck A is 1/2, and Deck B is also 1/2. So, the prior odds are:

P(A) / P(B) = 1/2 : 1/2 = 1 : 1

Now, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Decks A and B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Now, calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/81) = 12

Finally, multiply the prior odds and the likelihood ratio to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 12 = 12

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 12:1.

Answer: {odds: 12}
