To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B before drawing any cards. If we assume that the two decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (2/243) = 72

Now, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 72 = 72

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 72. This means that, after observing the outcome of 3 X's and 1 O, the odds for Deck A being the selected deck have increased by a factor of 72 compared to Deck B.
