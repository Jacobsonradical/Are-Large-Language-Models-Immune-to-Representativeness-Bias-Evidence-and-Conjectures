To find the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Prior odds: This is the ratio of the probabilities of the events before observing any evidence. In this case, since both decks have an equal chance of being selected, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.

Likelihood ratio: This is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the evidence (3 X's and 1 O) under each hypothesis.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. There are 2/3 probability of drawing an X and 1/3 probability of drawing an O. Since there are 4 cards being drawn, the order matters, so we need to account for all possible orders:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)*(1/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 8/27

Similarly, for Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4/81

Now, we calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/27) / (4/81) = 2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 2 = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 2:1 or simply 2.
