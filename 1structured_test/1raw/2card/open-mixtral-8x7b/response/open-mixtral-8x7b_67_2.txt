To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's denote the prior probabilities as P(A) and P(B), and the probability of drawing three X's and one O given decks A and B as P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B), respectively. Then, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)

Since the decks are very large, we can assume that drawing 4 cards does not significantly affect the proportion of X's and O's in the decks, so the prior probabilities are equal:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Next, we calculate the probabilities P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B).

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/27 * 27/2 = 8/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds = (8/2) * (1/2) = 4/2 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 2}
