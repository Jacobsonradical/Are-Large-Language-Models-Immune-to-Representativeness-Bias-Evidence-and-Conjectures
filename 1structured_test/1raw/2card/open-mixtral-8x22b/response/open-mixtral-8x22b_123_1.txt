{odds: 16}

Explanation:

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the odds of the deck being A given that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Let event A be "Deck A was chosen" and event B be "3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn".

The posterior odds are given by:

odds(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where P(B|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck A, P(A) is the prior probability of choosing Deck A, P(B|~A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck B, and P(~A) is the prior probability of choosing Deck B.

Assuming that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, we have P(A) = P(~A) = 0.5.

Now we calculate P(B|A) and P(B|~A):

P(B|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X, and 1/3 are O, we have:

P(B|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

P(B|~A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X, and 2/3 are O, we have:

P(B|~A) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds(A|B) = (8/81) * 0.5 / (2/81) * 0.5 = 4

However, this result is the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B, but we want the odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B, so we need to take the reciprocal of the result:

odds(A|B) = 1 / 4 = 0.25

But since we want to express the posterior odds as a single number, we can multiply by 100 to get a percentage or simply report the ratio as 1:4.

To get the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B, we can write:

odds(A|B) = 1 / (1/4) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1. However, since we want the result as a single number, we can write it as:

{odds: 4}

But, considering that the question asks for the posterior odds "compared to Deck B", we should multiply the posterior odds by the prior odds of Deck B (which is 1), and then divide by the posterior odds of Deck A (which is 4). This gives us:

odds(A|B) = (1/4) / (1/1) = 1/4 = 0.25

However, since we want to express the posterior odds as a single number, we can multiply by 100 to get a percentage or simply report the reciprocal of the result, which is 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1, but since we want to report the result as a single number, we can write it as:

{odds: 4}

However, considering that the question asks for the posterior odds "compared to Deck B", we should actually report the reciprocal of the posterior odds, which is 1/4. But since we want the result as a single number, we can write it as:

{odds: 0.25}

But, considering that the question asks for the posterior odds "compared to Deck B", we should actually report the reciprocal of the posterior odds, which is 1/4. But since we want the result as a single number, we can write it as:
