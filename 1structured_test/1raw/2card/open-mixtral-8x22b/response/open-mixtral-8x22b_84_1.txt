To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can use a more direct approach by considering the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

Let's denote P(A|D) as the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the data (D), and P(B|D) as the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck B given the data. We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio P(A|D) / P(B|D).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, the posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = L(A) / L(B)

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (3/1)^2

Posterior odds = (4/9) * (1/9) * 9

Posterior odds = 4/9

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4/9.

{odds: 4/9}
