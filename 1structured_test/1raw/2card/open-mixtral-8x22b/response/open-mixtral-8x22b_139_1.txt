{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

2. For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
   - The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.
   - The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

3. For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
   - The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.
   - The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

4. Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
   - The odds of drawing from Deck A given the evidence (3 X, 1 O) is the likelihood ratio of drawing from Deck A to Deck B.
   - This is calculated as [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1].

5. Performing the calculation, we get:
   - Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4.

6. However, since the problem asks for the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B, we should square the odds to account for drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card:
   - Posterior odds = 4^2 = 16.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 16.
