To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the prior odds (the odds before observing the data) to the posterior odds (the odds after observing the data). In this case, the prior odds are 1:1, since the selection of the deck was random.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let D be the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of A to B is equal to the prior odds of A to B times the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

The likelihood ratio is the probability of the observed data given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, divided by the probability of the observed data given that the cards were drawn from Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = P(D | A) / P(D | B)

To calculate the probabilities of the observed data given each deck, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is the probability of getting k successes (in this case, X's) in n trials (in this case, 4 cards drawn) with a probability of success p (in this case, the proportion of X's in each deck):

P(D | A) = binomial(3, 4, 2/3) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D | B) = binomial(3, 4, 1/3) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = [(4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3 = 2^3 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of A to B are:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8 = 8

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
