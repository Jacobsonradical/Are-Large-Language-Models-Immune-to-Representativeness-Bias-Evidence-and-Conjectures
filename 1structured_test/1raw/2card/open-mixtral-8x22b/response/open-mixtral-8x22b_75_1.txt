{odds: 81}

Explanation:

Let's denote the event of drawing from deck A as event E and the observed data, i.e., drawing 3 X's and 1 O, as event D.

The prior odds of drawing from deck A vs deck B is 1/1 or 1, as both decks are equally likely to be chosen.

The likelihood of observing D given E (i.e., drawing from deck A) is:
P(D|E) = P(drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
       = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
       = 8/81

The likelihood of observing D given not E (i.e., drawing from deck B) is:
P(D|not E) = P(drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)
           = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
           = 2/81

The posterior odds are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
               = 1 * (P(D|E) / P(D|not E))
               = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
               = 81

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 81.
