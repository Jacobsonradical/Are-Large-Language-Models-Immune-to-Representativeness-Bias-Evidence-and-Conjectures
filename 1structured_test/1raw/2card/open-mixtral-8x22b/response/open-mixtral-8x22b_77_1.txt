{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning:

To find the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then compare the two likelihoods.

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O. The probability is calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now that we have the probabilities for both decks, we can calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A compared to deck B:

Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

However, this calculation assumes that the prior probability of selecting either deck A or deck B is equal. If the prior probabilities are not equal, you would need to adjust the calculation accordingly. Since the question does not provide the prior probabilities, I've assumed they are equal, and the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of deck A.

Since you asked for the answer as a single number, the posterior odds are 81 (4 in favor of deck A for every 1 in favor of deck B).
