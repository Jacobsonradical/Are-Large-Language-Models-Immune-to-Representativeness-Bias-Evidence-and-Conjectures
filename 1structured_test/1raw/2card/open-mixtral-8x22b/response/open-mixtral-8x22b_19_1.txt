To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, for this problem, we can also use the likelihood ratio, which will give us the odds directly.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X|A) * P(1O|A)
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
= 8/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X|B) * P(1O|B)
= (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
= 2/81

The posterior odds of Deck A given the data is the ratio of these two probabilities:
Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)
= (8/81) / (2/81)
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
