To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that Deck A was selected and B as the event that Deck B was selected. We are given that the prior odds of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(data|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

P(data|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values we have:

Posterior odds = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 * 0.5/0.5 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
