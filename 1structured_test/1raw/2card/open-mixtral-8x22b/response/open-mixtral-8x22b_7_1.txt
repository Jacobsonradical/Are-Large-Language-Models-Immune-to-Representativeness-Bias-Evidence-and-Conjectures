To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A as the event that Deck A is chosen.
B as the event that Deck B is chosen.
X as the event that 3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn.

We want to find the posterior odds of A given X, which is P(A|X) / P(B|X).

First, let's find the prior odds, which is the odds of choosing Deck A or Deck B without any other information:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B)

Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, and the prior odds are 1/1 or simply 1.

Now let's find the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B), which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (since we have a 2/3 chance of drawing X from Deck A and 1/3 chance of drawing O)
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (since we have a 1/3 chance of drawing X from Deck B and 2/3 chance of drawing O)

Now we can find the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (P(X|A) / P(X|B))

Substituting the values we found for P(X|A) and P(X|B):

Posterior odds = 1 * ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)

Simplifying the expression:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^0 / (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^0
Posterior odds = 4/1 * 1/1
Posterior odds = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
