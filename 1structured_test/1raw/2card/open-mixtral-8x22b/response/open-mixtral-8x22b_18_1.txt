{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
- Probability of drawing an X card: 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O card: 1/3
- The probability of the observed outcome (3 X cards and 1 O card) is given by the binomial coefficient, which is calculated as:
P(A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
- Probability of drawing an X card: 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O card: 2/3
- The probability of the observed outcome is:
P(B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Next, we calculate the prior odds, which are the odds that Deck A was chosen over Deck B, assuming no information about the cards drawn. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio (P(A) / P(B)):
Posterior odds = Prior odds * (P(A) / P(B)) = 1 * (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 * 1 = 16/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 16:1.
