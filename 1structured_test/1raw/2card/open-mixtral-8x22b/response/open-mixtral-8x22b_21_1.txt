{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in order is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.
However, since the order in which we draw the cards doesn't matter, we need to account for the different ways to arrange 3 X's and 1 O, which is 4 (i.e., X-X-X-O, X-X-O-X, X-O-X-X, O-X-X-X).
So the total probability is 4 * (8/81) = 32/81.

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in order is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.
Again, since the order doesn't matter, we need to account for the different arrangements, which is 4.
So the total probability is 4 * (2/81) = 8/81.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds. The prior odds of selecting either deck is 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen). The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. In this case, the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A to Deck B, which is (32/81) / (8/81) = 4.

So the posterior odds are 1 * 4 = 4. However, the question asks for the odds in favor of Deck A, not the odds ratio. Since the odds ratio is 4, the odds in favor of Deck A are 4:1, or simply 4.

But since we are asked for the posterior odds "that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B," we need to consider the odds in favor of Deck A over Deck B, which is 4. To get the posterior odds, we need to multiply the prior odds (which is 1, since both decks are equally likely) by the likelihood ratio (which is 4), giving us 1 * 4 = 4. However, since we want the odds in favor of Deck A over Deck B, we need to adjust the odds ratio to reflect this. Since the odds ratio is 4:1 in favor of Deck A, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A over Deck B are 4:1, or simply 4.

But since we want the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to adjust for the fact that the prior odds are equal (i.e., 1:1), and the likelihood ratio is 4:1 in favor of Deck A. Therefore, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1 * 1:1 = 4:1, or simply 4.

But since we want the final answer to be in the format {odds: your answer as a single number}, we can simplify this to {odds: 4}. However, since we are looking for the odds in favor of Deck A over Deck B, we need to adjust the odds ratio to reflect this.
