{odds: 11}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in that order is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
However, there are 4 different orders in which we could draw 3 Xs and 1 O, so we multiply by 4:
4 * (8/81) = 32/81.

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in that order is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81.
Similarly, there are 4 different orders in which we could draw 3 Xs and 1 O, so we multiply by 4:
4 * (2/81) = 8/81.

Now we have the likelihoods for both decks:
L(A|data) = 32/81
L(B|data) = 8/81

The prior odds of selecting either deck are 1:1, as both decks were equally likely to be chosen.

So, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = L(A|data) / L(B|data) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81) * 1
Posterior odds = 32 / 8
Posterior odds = 4

However, this calculation assumes that the order of the draws matters. If we consider that the order does not matter, we should not multiply by 4. In that case:

L(A|data) = 8/81
L(B|data) = 2/81

Posterior odds = L(A|data) / L(B|data) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1
Posterior odds = 8 / 2
Posterior odds = 4

But since we are asked for the odds compared to Deck B, we need to invert this value:

Posterior odds = 1 / (4/1)
Posterior odds = 1 / 4

However, this is still comparing Deck A to Deck B, not the other way around. To compare Deck B to Deck A, we need to invert the value again:

Posterior odds = 1 / (1/4)
Posterior odds = 4

Since we are asked for the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we should invert this value:

Posterior odds = 1 / 4

L(B|data) = 2/81

Posterior odds = L(A|data) / L(B|data) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1
Posterior odds = 8 / 2
Posterior odds = 4
