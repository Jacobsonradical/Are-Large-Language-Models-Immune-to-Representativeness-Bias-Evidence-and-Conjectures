{odds: 81}

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H1 as the hypothesis that Deck A was chosen
- H2 as the hypothesis that Deck B was chosen
- D as the data that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of H1 to H2 given D is equal to the likelihood of D given H1 multiplied by the prior odds of H1 to H2.

We know that the prior odds of H1 to H2 is 1 (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen). Let's calculate the likelihoods:

- Likelihood of D given H1: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
- Likelihood of D given H2: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds (H1:H2|D) = Likelihood (D|H1) / Likelihood (D|H2) * Prior odds (H1:H2)

Posterior odds (H1:H2|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1 = 81/2 = 81

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 81 to 1.
