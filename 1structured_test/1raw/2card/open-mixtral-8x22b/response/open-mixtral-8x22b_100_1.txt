To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B are given by the formula:

Posterior odds = Prior odds Ã— Likelihood ratio

Assuming that Deck A and Deck B were equally likely to be chosen before drawing any cards (i.e., the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1), we can focus on calculating the likelihood ratio.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the given data (3 X's and 1 O) under each deck:

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

Here, (2/3)^3 is the probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck A, (1/3)^1 is the probability of drawing 1 O, and (4 choose 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 4 cards.

Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

Here, (1/3)^3 is the probability of drawing 3 X's from Deck B, (2/3)^1 is the probability of drawing 1 O, and (4 choose 3) is the same as before.

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)]

The (4 choose 3) terms cancel out, and we are left with:

Likelihood ratio = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Likelihood ratio = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2

Likelihood ratio = (4/9) / (1/9)

Likelihood ratio = 4

Since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1 compared to Deck B.
