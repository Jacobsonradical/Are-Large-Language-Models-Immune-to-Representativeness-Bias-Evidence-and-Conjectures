To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define our events:

A: Deck A is selected
B: Deck B is selected
X: 3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X) and P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X).

Since A and B are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B):

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Using the binomial distribution, we get:

P(X|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. Using the binomial distribution, we get:

P(X|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
Posterior odds = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
Posterior odds = 32/8 * 1/1 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
