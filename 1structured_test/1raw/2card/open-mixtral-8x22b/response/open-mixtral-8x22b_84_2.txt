To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A (P(A|data)) is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, and the probability of the same outcome from deck B (P(B|data)) is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1. The prior odds of selecting deck A or B is 1 (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from deck A is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) * Prior odds

Plugging in the values, we get:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] * 1
Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27)
Posterior odds = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A, compared to deck B, is 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
