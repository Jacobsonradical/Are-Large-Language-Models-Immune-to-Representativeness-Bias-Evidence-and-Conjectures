To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that Deck A was chosen, and B as the event that Deck B was chosen. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where "data" represents the observation of 3 X cards and 1 O card.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of observing the data given each deck.

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's assume that the prior probabilities of choosing each deck are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

Since the prior probabilities are equal, we can simplify the calculation by directly comparing the likelihoods:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = P(data|A) / P(data|B)

Now, let's plug in the values we found earlier:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = (4/9) / (1/9) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
