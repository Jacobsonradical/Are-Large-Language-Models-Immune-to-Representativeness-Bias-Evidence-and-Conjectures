To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. We are given that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of A and B:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we want the posterior odds of A compared to B, we can calculate the ratio of P(A|D) and P(B|D):

Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

We know that P(D) = P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B), so let's calculate it:

P(D) = (8/81 * 0.5) + (2/81 * 0.5) = 10/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds = [(8/81 * 0.5) / (10/81)] / [(2/81 * 0.5) / (10/81)] = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
