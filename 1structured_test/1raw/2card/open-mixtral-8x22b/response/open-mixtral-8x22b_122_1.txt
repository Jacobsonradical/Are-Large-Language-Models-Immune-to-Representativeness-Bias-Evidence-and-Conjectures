To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing one X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing one O card is 1/3. Since the draws are independent, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in that order is:

(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/81

However, since the order in which we draw the cards does not matter, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the positions of the O card among the 4 draws. There are 4 possible positions for the O card, so the overall probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:

4 * (8/81) = 32/81

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing one X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing one O card is 2/3. Using the same reasoning as above, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

4 * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now, let's assume that both decks were equally likely to be chosen before drawing any cards, so the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B is 1:1.

The posterior odds of having selected Deck A given the observed card draws is the likelihood ratio multiplied by the prior odds:

Posterior odds = (Likelihood of drawing from Deck A) / (Likelihood of drawing from Deck B) * Prior odds

Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81) * 1 = 32/8 * 1 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
