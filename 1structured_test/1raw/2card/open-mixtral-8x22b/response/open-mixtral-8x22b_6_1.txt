To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are given by the product of the likelihood ratio and the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. So the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. So the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from Deck A to the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from Deck B:
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume that the prior odds are equal (i.e., the odds of choosing Deck A are the same as the odds of choosing Deck B). Therefore, the prior odds are 1:1, or simply 1.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds:
Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds = 4 * 1 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
