To calculate the posterior odds, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O), where X and O represent the observed cards.

First, let's compute the likelihoods P(X,O|A) and P(X,O|B), where X represents drawing 3 X-marked cards and O represents drawing 1 O-marked card.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 (probability of drawing 3 X-marked cards)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing 1 O-marked card)

P(X,O|A) = P(X|A) * P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 (probability of drawing 3 X-marked cards)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing 1 O-marked card)

P(X,O|B) = P(X|B) * P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's compute the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):
P(A) = 1/2 (since either deck can be chosen with equal probability)
P(B) = 1/2

Finally, we can compute the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)
= [P(X,O|A) * P(A)] / [P(X,O|B) * P(B)]
= {[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] * (1/2)} / {[(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] * (1/2)}
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 2] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 2]
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
= 8 / 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are $8:1$ .
