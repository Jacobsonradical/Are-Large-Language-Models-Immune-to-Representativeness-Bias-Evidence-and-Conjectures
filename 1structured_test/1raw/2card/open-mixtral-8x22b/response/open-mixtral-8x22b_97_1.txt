To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds of A given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O, which can be written as P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O).

First, we calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Next, we need the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) of selecting each deck. Since the decks are chosen by chance, we assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities of A and B:

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

To find the posterior odds, we take the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

We don't need to compute the exact probabilities, as we can simplify the expression by canceling out common terms:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

Simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]

Posterior odds = (4/9) / (1/9)

Posterior odds = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
