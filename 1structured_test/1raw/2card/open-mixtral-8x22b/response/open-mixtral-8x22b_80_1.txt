To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities.

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given the observation (3 X's and 1 O) is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B:

Posterior odds = P(A|Observation) / P(B|Observation)

The posterior probability P(A|Observation) is the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given the observation, and P(B|Observation) is the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B given the observation.

We can calculate these posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|Observation) = P(Observation|A) * P(A) / P(Observation)
P(B|Observation) = P(Observation|B) * P(B) / P(Observation)

Since we are interested in the ratio of these probabilities, we can simplify the calculation by dividing these two equations:

Posterior odds = [P(Observation|A) * P(A)] / [P(Observation|B) * P(B)]

The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A is:

P(Observation|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B is:

P(Observation|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Since the decks were chosen by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Plugging in these values, we get:

Posterior odds = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
