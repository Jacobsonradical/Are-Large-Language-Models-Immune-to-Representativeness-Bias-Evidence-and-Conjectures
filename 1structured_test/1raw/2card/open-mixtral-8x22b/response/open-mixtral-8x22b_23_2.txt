{odds: 81}

Here's how to calculate that:

Let event A be "the 4 cards were drawn from deck A" and event B be "the 4 cards were drawn from deck B". Let E be the event "3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O".

We want to find the posterior odds of event A given event E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

First, calculate the prior odds: P(A) / P(B). Since the decks are chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, so the prior odds are 1.

Next, calculate the likelihoods: P(E|A) and P(E|B).

Using the binomial probability formula, P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81.

Similarly, P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81.

Now, use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * (P(E|A) / P(E|B))
= 1 * (32/81) / (8/81)
= 32/8.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 32:8, or simplified to 81.
