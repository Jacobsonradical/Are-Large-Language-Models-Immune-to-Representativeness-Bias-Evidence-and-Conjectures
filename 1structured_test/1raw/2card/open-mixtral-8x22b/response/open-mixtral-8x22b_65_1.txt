{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (with 2/3 X and 1/3 O):
- The probability of drawing an X is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in that order is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.
- However, since the order doesn't matter, we need to account for the different ways to arrange the Xs and O. In this case, there are 4 ways to choose the position of the O card (XXXX, XOXX, XXOX, XXXO). So the overall probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

For Deck B (with 1/3 X and 2/3 O):
- The probability of drawing an X is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in that order is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.
- Again, since the order doesn't matter, we need to account for the different ways to arrange the Xs and O. In this case, there are 4 ways to choose the position of the O card (XXXO, XXOX, XOXX, OXXX). So the overall probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds. The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1, since they are chosen by chance. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the given data (3 Xs and 1 O) from Deck A and Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = [4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Calculating this, we get:

Likelihood ratio = (2^3) / (1^3) = 8

The posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 8
Posterior odds = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are 81.
