{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O):
- P(A) = probability of picking Deck A = 1/2 (since there's an equal chance of picking either deck)
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O):
- P(B) = probability of picking Deck B = 1/2
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A) * Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A] / [P(B) * Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B]

Posterior odds = [(1/2) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/2) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Posterior odds = [(8/27) * (1/3)] / [(1/27) * (2/3)]

Posterior odds = [8/81] / [2/81]

Posterior odds = 8/2

Posterior odds = 4

However, this calculation only gives the ratio of probabilities, not the odds. To convert this ratio into odds, we subtract 1:

Posterior odds = 4 - 1 = 3

This means that the odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. But since we're asked for the odds of Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to express this as a single number:

Posterior odds = 3 (in favor of Deck A) + 1 (Deck B) = 4

So the final answer is:

{odds: 8}

This means that the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
