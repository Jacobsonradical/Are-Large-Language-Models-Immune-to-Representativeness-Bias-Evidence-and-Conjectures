To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We know that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A or Deck B are equal (1:1), since one of the decks has been selected by chance.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(X=3, O=1 | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(X=3, O=1 | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * P(X=3, O=1 | A) / P(X=3, O=1 | B)

Substitute the values of likelihoods:
Posterior odds = 1 * [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplify the expression:
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/27 * 1/3) / (1/27 * 2/3)
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/2)
Posterior odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
