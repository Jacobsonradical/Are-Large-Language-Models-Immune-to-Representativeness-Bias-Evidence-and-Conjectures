{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. So, the likelihood is given by the multinomial coefficient: (4 choose 3,1) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
2. Next, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. So, the likelihood is given by the multinomial coefficient: (4 choose 3,1) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81
3. Since the decks were chosen by chance, the prior odds for drawing from Deck A or Deck B are equal, i.e., 1:1.
4. The posterior odds are given by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio. So, the posterior odds are given by (1:1) * (32/81) / (8/81) = 1 * (32/8) = 16.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 16:1.
