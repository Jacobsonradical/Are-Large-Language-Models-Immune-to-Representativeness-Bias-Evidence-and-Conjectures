To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of being from deck A versus deck B given the evidence (3 X's and 1 O) is the likelihood of the evidence given deck A multiplied by the prior odds of deck A, divided by the likelihood of the evidence given deck B multiplied by the prior odds of deck B.

The prior odds of drawing from deck A and deck B are equal, since the decks were chosen by chance, so the prior odds are 1.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, and the likelihood of the same outcome from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

So the posterior odds are:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

= (8/27) / (2/27)

= 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
