To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D as the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A vs Deck B is 1:1 (since we have no information about which deck was chosen). The likelihood of observing D given A (P(D|A)) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Similarly, the likelihood of observing D given B (P(D|B)) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.

The likelihoods can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * (P(D|A) / P(D|B))
= ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ) / ( (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 )
= (8/27) / (2/27)
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1. In other words, it is 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed data.

Answer: {odds: 4}
