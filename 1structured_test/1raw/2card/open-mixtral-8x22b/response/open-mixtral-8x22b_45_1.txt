To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data).

First, let's compute the likelihoods P(data|A) and P(data|B). Assuming the draws are independent, we have:

P(data|A) = P(3 X and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(data|B) = P(3 X and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen beforehand (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2). Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2

Simplifying further, we get:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (4/9) / (1/9) = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
