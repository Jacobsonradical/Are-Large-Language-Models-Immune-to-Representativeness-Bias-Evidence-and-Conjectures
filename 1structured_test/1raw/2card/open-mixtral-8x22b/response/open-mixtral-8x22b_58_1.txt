To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can use a simplified version of the theorem since we are only interested in the ratio of probabilities of drawing the observed samples from the two decks.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the odds of A given the evidence E, which is the observed sample of 3 X cards and 1 O card.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Odds(A|E) = P(E|A) / P(E|B)
          = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
          = (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^2
          = 4/1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
