To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. Let X be the event that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X.

First, let's compute the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B. Since both decks are selected by chance, the prior odds are 1 (i.e., the decks are equally likely to be chosen).

Next, we need to compute the likelihood of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 32/81

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

Now, we can compute the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
= 1 * (P(X|A) / P(X|B))
= (32/81) / (8/81)
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 of them are marked X and 1 is marked O, are 4:1 compared to Deck B.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
