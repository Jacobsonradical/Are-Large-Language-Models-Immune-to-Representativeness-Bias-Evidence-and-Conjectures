To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- B as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- X as the evidence that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X.

We want to find the posterior odds O(A|X) / O(B|X), which can be calculated as:

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5]

Simplifying this, we get:

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = [(2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3] * [(1/3)^1 / (2/3)^1]

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = (8/27) / (1/27) * (1/3) / (2/3)

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = 8 * 1/2

O(A|X) / O(B|X) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
