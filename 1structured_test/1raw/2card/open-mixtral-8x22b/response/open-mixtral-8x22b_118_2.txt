To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (8/27) * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/27) * (4/9) = 4/243

Since the decks were chosen by chance, we can assume a uniform prior, meaning that each deck has an equal probability (1/2) of being chosen.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds (Deck A : Deck B) = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)
= [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
= [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(4/243) * (1/2)]
= (16/81) / (4/243)
= 16 * 243 / (81 * 4)
= 3648 / 324
= 11.26 (approximately)

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 11.26 to 1.

{odds: 11.26}
