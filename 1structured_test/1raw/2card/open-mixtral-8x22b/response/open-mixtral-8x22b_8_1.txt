To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. We are looking for the posterior odds of the decks given the observed cards.

Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.
So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.
So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the prior odds. Since we don't have any information about which deck is more likely to be selected, we assume that the decks are equally likely to be chosen. So, the prior odds of A to B is 1:1.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the ratio of the likelihoods.

Posterior odds (A:B) = Prior odds (A:B) * Likelihood ratio (A:B)
Posterior odds (A:B) = 1 * (P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B))
Posterior odds (A:B) = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds (A:B) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
