To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal (1:1), since there is no additional information provided about the selection process.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = likelihood ratio * prior odds
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1
Posterior odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
