To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds in favor of deck A given the evidence (4 cards drawn, 3 of which are X) is the prior odds in favor of deck A multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For deck A, the probability of drawing one X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing one O card is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For deck B, the probability of drawing one X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing one O card is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Assuming that the prior odds in favor of deck A and deck B are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B)), the posterior odds in favor of deck A given the evidence is equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are:

{odds: 4}
