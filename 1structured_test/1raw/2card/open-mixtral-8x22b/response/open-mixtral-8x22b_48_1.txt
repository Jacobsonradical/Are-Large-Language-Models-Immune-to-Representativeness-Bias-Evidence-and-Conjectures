To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the posterior odds of the deck being A given that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card. The posterior odds are defined as:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

where A and B are the events that deck A and deck B were chosen, respectively, and D is the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Note that these are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, given that that deck was chosen.

Next, we need to find the prior odds of choosing deck A versus deck B. Since we have no information about which deck was chosen, we can assume that the decks were chosen with equal probability:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * Prior odds
= (4/27) / (2/27) * 1
= 2/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A are 2:1 compared to deck B.

Answer:
{odds: 2}
