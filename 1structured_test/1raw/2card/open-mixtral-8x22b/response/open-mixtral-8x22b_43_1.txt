{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

From Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

From Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
- The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal since both decks were chosen by chance (1:1).
- The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of the observed data given each deck, i.e., 8/81 : 2/81.
- So, the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are (1:1) * (8/81 : 2/81) = 8/2 = 4.

However, since we want the odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, the answer is 8 (not 4), as we need to compare the probability of having drawn from Deck A to the probability of having drawn from Deck B.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are $8:1$ .
