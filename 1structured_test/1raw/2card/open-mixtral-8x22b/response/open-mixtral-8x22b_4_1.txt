To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|Data) / P(B|Data).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(Data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/27 * 4 = 32/27
P(Data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 1/27 * 4 = 4/27

The prior odds are equal since either deck A or deck B is equally likely to be chosen:

P(A) / P(B) = 1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = (P(Data|A) / P(Data|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))
Posterior Odds = (32/27) / (4/27) * 1
Posterior Odds = 32/4
Posterior Odds = 8

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8 to 1.

{odds: 8}
