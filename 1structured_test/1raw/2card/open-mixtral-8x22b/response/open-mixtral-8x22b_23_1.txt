To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of A (deck A) versus B (deck B) given the observed outcome can be expressed as:

odds(A|X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) / P(X,O|B) * P(B)

In this case, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, as each deck was equally likely to be chosen.

Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Plug these into Bayes' theorem:

odds(A|X,O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5]

Simplify the expression:

odds(A|X,O) = [(2/3)^3] / [(1/3)^3]

odds(A|X,O) = (2^3) / (1^3)

odds(A|X,O) = 8 / 1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is $8:1$ .
