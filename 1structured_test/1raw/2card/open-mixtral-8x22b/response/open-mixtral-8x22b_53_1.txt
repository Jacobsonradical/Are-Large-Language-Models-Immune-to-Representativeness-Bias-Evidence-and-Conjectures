To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the deck is Deck A
- B as the event that the deck is Deck B
- D as the event that 3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which is the posterior odds of A over B.

First, let's find P(A), P(B), P(D|A), and P(D|B).

Since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's find P(D|A) and P(D|B), which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

P(D|A) = (Probability of drawing an X from A) ^ 3 * (Probability of drawing an O from A) ^ 1
P(D|A) = (2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) ^ 1

P(D|B) = (Probability of drawing an X from B) ^ 3 * (Probability of drawing an O from B) ^ 1
P(D|B) = (1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) ^ 1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
Posterior odds = [(2/3) ^ 3 * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3) ^ 3 * (2/3) * 0.5]
Posterior odds = [(8/27) * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/27) * (2/3) * 0.5]
Posterior odds = (32/243) / (2/243)
Posterior odds = 32/2
Posterior odds = 16

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 16:1.

{odds: 16}
