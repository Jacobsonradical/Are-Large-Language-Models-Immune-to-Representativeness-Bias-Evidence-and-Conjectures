{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use the law of total probability and Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B. Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn from the selected deck.

We want to find the posterior odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since either deck can be selected with equal probability)

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probabilities:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since P(A) = P(B), the posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

However, this is the posterior probability ratio, not the odds. To find the posterior odds, we need to divide the posterior probability ratio by the prior odds ratio, which in this case is 1 (since the prior probabilities are equal).

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 (the posterior probability ratio). However, since we're looking for the odds in favor of Deck A, we take the reciprocal of the odds in favor of Deck B, which gives us an odds of 9 in favor of Deck A.
