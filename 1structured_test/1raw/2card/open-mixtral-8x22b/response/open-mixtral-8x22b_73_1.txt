{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let event E be "the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A" and event F be "3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn".

First, we need to find the prior odds, which is the ratio of P(E) to P(not E). Since both decks were equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1.

Next, we need to find the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of P(F|E) to P(F|not E).

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by:

P(F|E) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/81

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is given by:

P(F|not E) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/81

Now, we can find the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(F|E) / P(F|not E) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

Finally, we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

However, this is the odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A vs Deck B. Since the question asks for the odds of drawing from Deck A vs Deck B, we need to square the likelihood ratio (because we're comparing the odds of drawing 3 out of 4 X cards vs 1 out of 4 X cards).

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (Likelihood ratio)^2 = 1 * 4^2 = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 16 to 1.
