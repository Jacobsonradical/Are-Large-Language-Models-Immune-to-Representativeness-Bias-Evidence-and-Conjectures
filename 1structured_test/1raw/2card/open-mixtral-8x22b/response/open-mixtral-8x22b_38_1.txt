{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

2. For Deck A, the probability is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

3. For Deck B, the probability is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

4. The likelihood ratio (LR) for Deck A versus Deck B is: 8/81 / 2/81 = 4

5. Since both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially, the prior odds were 1:1, or just 1.

6. The posterior odds are obtained by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio: 1 * 4 = 4

7. However, since we're comparing the odds of Deck A to Deck B, we need to express this as the odds of Deck A relative to Deck B. So, the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are: 4:1, which is equivalent to 16 when expressed as a single number.
