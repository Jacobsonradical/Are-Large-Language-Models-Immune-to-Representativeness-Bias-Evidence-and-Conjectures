{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.

   So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

2. Next, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.

   So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

3. Now, let's calculate the posterior odds. Since the odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B initially are equal (1:1), we only need to consider the likelihoods calculated in steps 1 and 2.

   The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is the ratio of the likelihoods: (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

4. However, we're asked for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, not the ratio of likelihoods. Since the initial odds are equal, the posterior odds are simply the odds of drawing the observed combination from Deck A compared to Deck B, which is 4 * 4 = 16.

Therefore, the posterior odds are 16:1 in favor of Deck A.
