To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A (given that we have observed 3 X cards and 1 O card) compared to Deck B is given by the formula:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio

First, let's calculate the prior odds, which is simply the ratio of the probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds is 1:

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the ratio of the probabilities of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

P(Observation | Deck A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A, which has 2/3 X cards and 1/3 O cards. The probability is given by the binomial distribution:

P(Observation | Deck A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(Observation | Deck B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B, which has 1/3 X cards and 2/3 O cards. The probability is given by the binomial distribution:

P(Observation | Deck B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(Observation | Deck A) / P(Observation | Deck B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
