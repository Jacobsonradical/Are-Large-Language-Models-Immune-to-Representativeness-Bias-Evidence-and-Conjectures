To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the product of the likelihood and the prior odds.

First, let's calculate the likelihood. The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1. The same probability for Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

So, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = 8

Since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen, we can assume equal prior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B. The prior odds are therefore 1:1, or just 1.

The posterior odds are then the product of the likelihood ratio and the prior odds:

Posterior odds = LR * Prior odds = 8 * 1 = 8

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8:1.

{odds: 8}
