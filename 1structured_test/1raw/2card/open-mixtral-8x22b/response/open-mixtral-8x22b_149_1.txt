To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The prior probability of selecting either deck is 1/2 (since the decks are chosen by chance).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of having selected Deck A:

P(Deck A | 3 Xs and 1 O) = P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 Xs and 1 O)

The denominator P(3 Xs and 1 O) is the sum of the probabilities of the event happening given each deck:

P(3 Xs and 1 O) = P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)

Now let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3 Xs and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 Xs and 1 O)

Substitute the expressions we found earlier:

Posterior odds = [P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 Xs and 1 O)] / [P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / P(3 Xs and 1 O)]

Simplify the expression by canceling out P(3 Xs and 1 O) and P(Deck A) and P(Deck B) since they are equal:

Posterior odds = P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 Xs and 1 O | Deck B)

Now, substitute the values we calculated earlier:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Posterior odds = [(8/27) * (1/3)] / [(1/27) * (2/3)]

Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
