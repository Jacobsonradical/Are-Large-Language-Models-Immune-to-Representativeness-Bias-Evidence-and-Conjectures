To calculate the posterior odds, we use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of A given the evidence (E) is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B. The posterior probability of A is the product of the prior probability of A and the likelihood of E given A, divided by the total probability of E.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A,
- P(B) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B,
- P(E|A) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A,
- P(E|B) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B,
- P(E) as the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Given that one deck is selected by chance, we assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

The total probability of E is:

P(E) = P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) = (4/27)*0.5 + (2/27)*0.5 = 6/27 = 2/9

The posterior probability of A is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A)P(A) / P(E) = (4/27)*0.5 / (2/9) = 2/3

The posterior probability of B is:

P(B|E) = P(E|B)P(B) / P(E) = (2/27)*0.5 / (2/9) = 1/3

Finally, the posterior odds of A compared to B is:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2.

Answer:
{odds: 2}
