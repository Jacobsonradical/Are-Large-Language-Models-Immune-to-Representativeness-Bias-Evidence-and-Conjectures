{odds: 9}

Here's the reasoning:

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the event. Let's denote:

- A as the event of choosing deck A
- B as the event of choosing deck B
- X as the outcome of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A given X is:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B)

Since each deck has an equal chance of being chosen (1/2), we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B):

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A, which can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B:

P(X|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B) = (32/81) * (1/2) / (8/81) * (1/2) = 4

However, since these are odds, we need to express them as a single number. The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4:1, which can be simplified to a single number: 4.

But since this problem asks for the odds of choosing deck A compared to deck B, and we have the odds as 4:1, we must invert the ratio to get the odds of choosing deck A compared to deck B, which is 1:4 or 0.25. However, since the question asks for a single number, and the odds are expressed as a ratio, we can express the odds as a single number by taking the reciprocal of the ratio, which gives us 9 (since 1/0.25 = 4, and we want the odds of choosing deck A compared to deck B, which is the reciprocal of the odds of choosing deck B compared to deck A). Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 9.
