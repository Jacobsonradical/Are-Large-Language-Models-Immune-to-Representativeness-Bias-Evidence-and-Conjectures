{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

2. Similarly, we can calculate the likelihood of drawing the same combination from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

3. The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1, as they are chosen by chance.

4. The posterior odds are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data given each deck, which is (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

5. Therefore, the posterior odds are 1 * 4 = 4, which means that it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.

6. However, the question asks for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. Since the posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are 4:1, the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:(1/4) = 16, or 8 when expressed as a single number.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8.
