{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (with 2/3 X and 1/3 O cards):
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

For Deck B (with 1/3 X and 2/3 O cards):
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume equal prior probabilities for both decks (i.e., P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2).

The posterior odds of Deck A given the evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card) are:
Posterior odds = P(Deck A | evidence) / P(Deck B | evidence)
               = [P(evidence | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / [P(evidence | Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
               = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
               = 81.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 81:1.
