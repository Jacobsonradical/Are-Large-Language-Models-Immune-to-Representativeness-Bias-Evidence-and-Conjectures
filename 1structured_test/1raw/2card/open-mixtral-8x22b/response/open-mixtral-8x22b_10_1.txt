To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event A given an observation B is equal to the prior odds of A times the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A and the event of drawing from Deck B as B. The prior odds of A and B are equal since we selected one of the decks by chance, so the prior odds are 1:1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is given by:

L(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

L(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is then:

L(A) / L(B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

L(A) / L(B) = (2^3 * 1^1) / (1^3 * 2^1)

L(A) / L(B) = 8 / 2

L(A) / L(B) = 4

So, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A given the observation of 3 Xs and 1 O is 4 times the prior odds. Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
