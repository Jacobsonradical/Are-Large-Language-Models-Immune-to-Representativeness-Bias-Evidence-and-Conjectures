To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given the evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card) is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- E as the evidence that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn.

The prior odds of A to B is the ratio of the probabilities of A and B before observing any cards. Since both decks were equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1, or simply 1.

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the evidence E given A and given B.

The probability of observing E given A is:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 1)

The probability of observing E given B is:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 1)

Now, the likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

LR = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2

LR = (4/9) / (1/9)

LR = 4

Finally, the posterior odds of A to B given the evidence E is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
