To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the priors and likelihoods:

Prior odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = 1 / 1 = 1 (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen)

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A / Likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B)

Posterior odds = 1 * [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Posterior odds = 1 * [(8/27) / (1/27) * (1/3) / (2/3)]

Posterior odds = 1 * [8 / 2 * 1 / 2]

Posterior odds = 1 * [4 / 2]

Posterior odds = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 2:1.

{odds: 2}
