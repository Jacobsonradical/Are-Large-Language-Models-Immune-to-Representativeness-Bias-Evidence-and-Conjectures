To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are interested in the odds of the hypothesis (deck A) given the evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Let's denote:
H1: The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from deck A
H2: The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from deck B
E: The evidence that we observed (3 X cards and 1 O card)

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of H1 over H2 given the evidence E is:

odds(H1:H2 | E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) / P(E | H2) * P(H2)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume that P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E | H1) and P(E | H2).

For H1 (deck A), the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(E | H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For H2 (deck B), the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(E | H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
odds(H1:H2 | E) = (8/81) * 0.5 / (2/81) * 0.5 = 4/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4:1.
