To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(data|A) and P(data|B) using the binomial distribution. The probability of drawing k successes (X's) in n trials (draws), given a probability p of success on each trial, is given by:

P(k; n, p) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

For Deck A, p = 2/3, and for Deck B, p = 1/3. The number of successes k = 3 and the number of trials n = 4.

P(data|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^(4-3) = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
P(data|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^(4-3) = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now let's calculate the prior odds P(A) / P(B). Since one of the decks is chosen by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. The prior odds are therefore:

P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

Finally, the posterior odds are given by:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) / P(B)

Plugging in the values we found:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (32/81) * (1/2) / (8/81) / (1/2) = 32/8 * 1/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
