To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- B as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- E as the evidence that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are X and 1 is O.

We want to find the posterior odds O(A:B | E), which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|E) and P(B|E).

First, we calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B):

- P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X and 1/3 are O, we can calculate this using the binomial probability formula:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

- P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X and 2/3 are O, we can calculate this as:

P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Next, we need the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), which are the probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since both decks are chosen by chance, we can assume:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities P(A|E) and P(B|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The term P(E) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B) = (32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2) = 20/81

Now we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|E) = (32/81) * (1/2) / (20/81) = 32/40 = 4/5
P(B|E) = (8/81) * (1/2) / (20/81) = 8/40 = 1/5

Finally, we calculate the posterior odds O(A:B | E):

O(A:B | E) = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
