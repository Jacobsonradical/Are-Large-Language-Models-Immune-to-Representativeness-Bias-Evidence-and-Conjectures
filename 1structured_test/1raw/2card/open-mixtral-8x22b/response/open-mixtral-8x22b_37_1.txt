To find the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, since we are only interested in the ratio of the probabilities (odds), we can simplify the calculation by considering the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the deck is Deck A
- B as the event that the deck is Deck B
- D as the data observed (3 X's and 1 O)

The prior odds of picking Deck A versus Deck B is 1:1, since both decks are chosen by chance.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of observing D given A (P(D|A)) and the likelihood of observing D given B (P(D|B)).

For Deck A:
- P(X) = 2/3
- P(O) = 1/3

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial distribution:
P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

For Deck B:
- P(X) = 1/3
- P(O) = 2/3

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now, we can find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)
               = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
               = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
               = 32/8 * 1/1
               = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
