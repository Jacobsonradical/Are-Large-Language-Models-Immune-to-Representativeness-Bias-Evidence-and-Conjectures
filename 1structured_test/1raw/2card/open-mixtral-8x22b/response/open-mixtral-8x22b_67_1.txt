To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in that order is:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

However, since the order in which the cards are drawn does not matter, we need to account for the different ways we can arrange 3 X cards and 1 O card. There are 4 choose 3 ways to do this, which is equal to 4. So the actual probability is:
P(3X,1O|A) = 4 * (8/81) = 32/81

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. Using the same reasoning as above, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(3X,1O|B) = 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds. Assuming that Deck A and Deck B were equally likely to be chosen before drawing any cards (i.e., the prior probability is 1/2 for each deck), the posterior odds of Deck A given the evidence is:
Posterior Odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)
= P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)
= (32/81) / (8/81) * (1/2) / (1/2)
= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is $4:1$ .

Answer:
{odds: 4}
