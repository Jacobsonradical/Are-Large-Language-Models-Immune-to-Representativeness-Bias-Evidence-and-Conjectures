To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A: The event that Deck A was chosen.
B: The event that Deck B was chosen.
D: The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A given the data.

First, let's find the likelihood of observing the data given that each deck was chosen:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, let's assume that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen a priori (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify the posterior odds to the ratio of the likelihoods:

Odds = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (4/27) / (2/27) = 2/1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 2:1.
