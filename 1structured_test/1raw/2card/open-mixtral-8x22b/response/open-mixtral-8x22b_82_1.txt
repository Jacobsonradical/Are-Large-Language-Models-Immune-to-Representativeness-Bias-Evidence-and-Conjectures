To approach this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. We are asked to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of decks A and B given the observed data.

Let's denote the following events:
- A: The selected deck is Deck A.
- B: The selected deck is Deck B.
- D: The observed data, which is drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

The posterior odds we want to find is given by:

odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior probabilities as:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the decks are selected by chance, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(D|A) and P(D|B), which are the probabilities of observing the data given that we are drawing from Deck A or Deck B, respectively.

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A is given by:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B is given by:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

The term (4 choose 3) is the binomial coefficient, which accounts for the different ways we can choose 3 cards marked X out of the 4 drawn cards.

Since the term (4 choose 3) is the same for both decks, we can simplify the calculation of the posterior odds as follows:

odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
odds = [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]
odds = (4/9) / (1/9)
odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

Here's the final answer in the requested format:

{odds: 4}
