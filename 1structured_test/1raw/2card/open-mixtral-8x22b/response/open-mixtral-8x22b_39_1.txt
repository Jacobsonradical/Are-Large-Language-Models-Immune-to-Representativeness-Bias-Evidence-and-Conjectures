To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the formula:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume that the prior odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B is 1:1, or simply 1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
= (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^1
= (2/3)^2
= 4/9

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
= 1 × 4/9
= 4/9

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:9, or simply 4/9.

{odds: 4/9}
