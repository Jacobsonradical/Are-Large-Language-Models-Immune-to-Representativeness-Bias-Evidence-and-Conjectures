To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the posterior odds to the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds of drawing from Deck A vs. Deck B are 1:1, since we don't have any information about which deck was chosen.

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the two probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X's, 1 O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

The posterior odds are then the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
