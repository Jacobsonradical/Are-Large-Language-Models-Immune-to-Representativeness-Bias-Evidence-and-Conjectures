To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The odds in favor of deck A given the observed data can be expressed as:

Odds(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) * P(B)

Let's assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing the given data from each deck, P(data|A) and P(data|B).

For deck A:
P(data|A) = P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For deck B:
P(data|B) = P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A|data) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Odds(A|data) = [(2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3] * [(1/3) / (2/3)] * [(1/2) / (1/2)]

Odds(A|data) = [8/27] / [1/27] * [1/2] / [1/2]

Odds(A|data) = 8 * 1 * 1

Odds(A|data) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8 to 1, compared to Deck B.

Answer: {odds: 8}
