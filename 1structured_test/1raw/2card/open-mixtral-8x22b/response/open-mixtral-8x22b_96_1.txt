To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define our prior probabilities and likelihoods:

Prior probabilities:
P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5 (since either deck can be chosen with equal probability)

Likelihoods (probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given a deck):
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) / P(3 X's and 1 O)
P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) / P(3 X's and 1 O)

The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O is:
P(3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)
                 = (4/27 * 0.5) + (2/27 * 0.5)
                 = 6/27 * 0.5
                 = 1/9

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) = (4/27 * 0.5) / (1/9) = 4/6 = 2/3
P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O) = (2/27 * 0.5) / (1/9) = 2/6 = 1/3

Finally, the posterior odds are:

Odds(Deck A : Deck B) = P(Deck A | 3 X's and 1 O) / P(Deck B | 3 X's and 1 O)
                      = (2/3) / (1/3)
                      = 2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2:1.

{odds: 2}
