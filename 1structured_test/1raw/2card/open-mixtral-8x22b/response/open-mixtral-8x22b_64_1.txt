To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the two hypotheses:

H1: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
H2: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Let's denote the evidence E as "3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn".

We are interested in finding the posterior odds O(H1:H2 | E), which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(H1 | E) and P(H2 | E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H1 | E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) / P(E)
P(H2 | E) = P(E | H2) * P(H2) / P(E)

We know that P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5, since the deck was chosen by chance.

Now, let's calculate P(E | H1) and P(E | H2).

P(E | H1) = (probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A) * (probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck A)
P(E | H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

P(E | H2) = (probability of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B) * (probability of drawing 1 O card from Deck B)
P(E | H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

O(H1:H2 | E) = P(H1 | E) / P(H2 | E)
O(H1:H2 | E) = [(P(E | H1) * P(H1)) / P(E)] / [(P(E | H2) * P(H2)) / P(E)]
O(H1:H2 | E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) / P(E | H2) * P(H2)
O(H1:H2 | E) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5]
O(H1:H2 | E) = [(2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3] * [(1/3) / (2/3)]
O(H1:H2 | E) = 8 * (1/2)
O(H1:H2 | E) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
