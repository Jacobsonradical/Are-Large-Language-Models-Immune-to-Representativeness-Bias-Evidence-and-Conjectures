To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as event A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as event B. We are given that the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since one of the decks was chosen by chance.

Let's denote the observed data as event D, where D is the event that 3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn. The likelihood of observing D given that we are drawing from Deck A is:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of observing D given that we are drawing from Deck B is:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can find the posterior odds by taking the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D):

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)
= [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
= P(D|A) / P(D|B)
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= 8/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8:1.

{odds: 8}
