To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- A: The deck chosen is Deck A.
- B: The deck chosen is Deck B.
- E: The observed outcome of drawing 4 cards, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

First, let's compute the likelihoods of the observed outcome (E) given each deck (A or B):

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

We also need the prior probabilities of choosing each deck, which is assumed to be equal (1/2 for each deck).

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since we are looking for the odds ratio, we can simplify the problem by considering only the numerators, as the denominator (P(E)) is common to both and will cancel out:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(4/27) * (1/2)] / [(2/27) * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (4/27) / (2/27) = 4/2 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 2:1.
