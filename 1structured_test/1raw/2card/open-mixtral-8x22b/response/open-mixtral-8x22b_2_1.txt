To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let E be the evidence, which is that 3 out of 4 cards drawn were marked X.

First, we calculate the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B, which is 1:1 since either deck is equally likely to be chosen.

Next, we calculate the likelihood of observing E given A and B. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(E|A) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] * [(4 choose 3) / (total_cards choose 4)]

where (2/3)^3 is the probability of drawing 3 X's, and (1/3)^1 is the probability of drawing 1 O. The term [(4 choose 3) / (total_cards choose 4)] is the probability of drawing any 4 cards out of the deck, and it is the same for both decks, so it cancels out when we take the ratio of the likelihoods.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(E|B) = [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] * [(4 choose 3) / (total_cards choose 4)]

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

posterior odds = prior odds * likelihood ratio
               = 1 * [P(E|A) / P(E|B)]
               = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
               = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2
               = 4/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1.
