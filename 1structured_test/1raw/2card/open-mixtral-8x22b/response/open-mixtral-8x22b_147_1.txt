To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X as the event that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X.

We want to find the posterior odds for A given X, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|X) and P(B|X).

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since we don't have any information about which deck was more likely to be chosen, we can assume that both decks were equally likely to be selected:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Next, let's find the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B). These are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, respectively.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the posterior probabilities P(A|X) and P(B|X) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The normalizing constant P(X) is the sum of the numerators of the posterior probabilities:
P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (8/81) * 0.5 + (2/81) * 0.5 = 10/81

Finally, we can find the posterior odds for A given X:

Odds(A|X) = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)] / [P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)]

Plugging in the values we found:

Odds(A|X) = [(8/81) * 0.5 / (10/81)] / [(2/81) * 0.5 / (10/81)] = (8/20) / (2/20) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
