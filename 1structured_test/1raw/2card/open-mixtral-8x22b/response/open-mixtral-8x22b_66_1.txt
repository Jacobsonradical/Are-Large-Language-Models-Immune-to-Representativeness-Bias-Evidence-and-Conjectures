To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the decks as A and B, and the observed data as D. We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D).

First, let's compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's assume that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, which means P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now compute the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The denominator P(D) is the same for both probabilities, so we can ignore it when computing the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values we computed earlier:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3] * [(1/3) / (2/3)] * [(1/2) / (1/2)]

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (1/27) * (1/2) / (2/2)

Posterior odds = 8/1 * 1/4

Posterior odds = 2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2:1.

Answer: {odds: 2}
