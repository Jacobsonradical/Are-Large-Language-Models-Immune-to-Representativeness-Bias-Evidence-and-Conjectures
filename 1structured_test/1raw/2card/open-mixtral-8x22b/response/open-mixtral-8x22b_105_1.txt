To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- E as the evidence, which is the outcome of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find the posterior odds O(A:B | E), which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|E)/P(B|E).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, P(E|A), and the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, P(E|B).

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)
        = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4
        = 32/81

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)
        = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4
        = 8/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. Then, the posterior probability of A given the evidence E is:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
        = (32/81) * (1/2) / [(32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2)]
        = 32/40
        = 8/10

Similarly, the posterior probability of B given the evidence E is:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)
        = (8/81) * (1/2) / [(32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2)]
        = 8/40
        = 2/10

Finally, the posterior odds O(A:B | E) is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|E)/P(B|E):
O(A:B | E) = (8/10) / (2/10)
           = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
