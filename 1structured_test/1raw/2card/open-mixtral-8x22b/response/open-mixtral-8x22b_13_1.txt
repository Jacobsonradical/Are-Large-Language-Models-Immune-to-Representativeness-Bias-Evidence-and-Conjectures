To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing from Deck B as B. We want to find the odds of A given the evidence E (drawing 3 X's and 1 O), which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

P(E|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/81

P(E|B), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probabilities for drawing from Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2). We can now calculate the posterior odds.

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Since we assumed P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, the posterior odds simplify to:

Posterior odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 * 81/81 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
