To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that we drew from deck A
- B: the event that we drew from deck B
- D: the observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds are given by:

odds(A|D) / odds(B|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)

We are given that the prior odds P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen by chance).

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. The probability of drawing an X from deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So, the probability of the observed data is:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Similarly, P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. The probability of drawing an X from deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. So, the probability of the observed data is:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

odds(A|D) / odds(B|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)
                                 = (8/81) * 0.5 / (2/81) * 0.5
                                 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Final answer:
{odds: 4}
