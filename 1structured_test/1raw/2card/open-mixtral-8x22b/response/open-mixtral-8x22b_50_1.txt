To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we don't have any explicit prior probabilities for selecting either deck, so we can assume that each deck is equally likely to be chosen (prior odds = 1).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. Since we're drawing 4 cards without replacement, the probabilities will change slightly after each draw, but for simplicity, we'll use the initial probabilities as an approximation.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/27 * 1/3 * 4 = 32/81

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 1/27 * 2/3 * 4 = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by dividing the likelihood of the outcome given Deck A by the likelihood of the outcome given Deck B:

Posterior odds = Likelihood(Deck A) / Likelihood(Deck B)
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81)
Posterior odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed outcome, are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
