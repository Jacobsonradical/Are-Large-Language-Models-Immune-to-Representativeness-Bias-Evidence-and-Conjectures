To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that we are drawing from Deck A
- B: the event that we are drawing from Deck B
- D: the observed data, i.e., drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probability of A given D to the probability of B given D:

odds(A:B|D) = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

First, let's calculate P(A|D) and P(B|D) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we chose the deck by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 2/81

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

odds(A:B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)) / (P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D))
odds(A:B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81)
odds(A:B|D) = 4/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
