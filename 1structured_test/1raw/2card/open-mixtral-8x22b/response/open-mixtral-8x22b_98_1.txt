To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen, and B be the event that Deck B was chosen. We are interested in finding the posterior odds of A given the evidence E (3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn).

First, we calculate the likelihood of observing E given each deck:

P(E | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(E | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we assume a uniform prior (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A | E) = P(E | A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B | E) = P(E | B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since P(E) is the same for both calculations and cancels out, we can directly compare the likelihoods:

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = (P(E | A) * P(A)) / (P(E | B) * P(B))

Plugging in the values:

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

Simplifying the expression:

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = (8/27) * (1/3) / (1/27) * (2/3)

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = 8 * 1 / 1 * 2

P(A | E) / P(B | E) = 16/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 16:1.

{odds: 16}
