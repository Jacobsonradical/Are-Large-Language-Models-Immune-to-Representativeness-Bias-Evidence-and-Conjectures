To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H1 as the hypothesis that deck A was chosen.
H2 as the hypothesis that deck B was chosen.
E as the evidence that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of H1 to H2 given the evidence E is:

Odds(H1:H2 | E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) / P(E | H2) * P(H2)

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume that P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5, so these terms will cancel out.

Now we need to calculate P(E | H1) and P(E | H2).

P(E | H1) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. So the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in that order is:

P(E | H1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

But the order in which we draw the cards doesn't matter, so we need to consider the number of ways to choose the positions of the 3 X cards out of 4 draws. This is a combination problem, and the number of combinations is C(4,3) = 4. So the total probability is:

P(E | H1) = 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, P(E | H2) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. So the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in that order is:

P(E | H2) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

And again, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the positions of the 3 X cards out of 4 draws, which is C(4,3) = 4. So the total probability is:

P(E | H2) = 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(H1:H2 | E) = P(E | H1) / P(E | H2)
= (4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / (4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
= (2^3 * 3) / (3^3)
= 8 / 9

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8:9.

{odds: 8/9}
