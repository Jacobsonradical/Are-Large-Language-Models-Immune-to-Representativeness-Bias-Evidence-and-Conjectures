To calculate the posterior odds, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We are given that the prior odds of choosing Deck A or Deck B are equal (since one of the decks has been selected by chance), so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values we found:
Posterior odds = (4/27 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = (4/27) / (2/27) = 2

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are $2:1$ .
