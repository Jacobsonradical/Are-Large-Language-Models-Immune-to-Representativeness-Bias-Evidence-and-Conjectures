To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can also use a more intuitive approach.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

The ratio of these two likelihoods is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/1.

Since the decks were chosen by chance, the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 8/1 = 8.

So, the posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of Deck A.
