To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are given by the product of the likelihood ratio and the prior odds.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

First, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the given data (3 X's and 1 O) under each deck.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is:
LR = P(3 X's and 1 O | A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | B)
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2
= 4/1

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The prior odds are:
PO = P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1/1

Finally, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = LR * PO = 4/1 * 1/1 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
