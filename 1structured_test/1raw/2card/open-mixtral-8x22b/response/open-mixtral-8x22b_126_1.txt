To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as event A, and the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B as event B.

First, we calculate the prior odds, which are the odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B before any cards are drawn. Since the decks are chosen by chance, the prior odds are 1:1.

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is therefore:
(8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Finally, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio to obtain the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
