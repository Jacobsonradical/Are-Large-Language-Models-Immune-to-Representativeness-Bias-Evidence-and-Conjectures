To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given the observed data is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote the prior probability of drawing from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). Since there is no reason to believe one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. So the prior odds of A to B (P(A)/P(B)) is 1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3 and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. So the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

For Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3 and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. So the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two likelihoods, which is (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

So the posterior odds of A to B is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, which is 1 * 4 = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
