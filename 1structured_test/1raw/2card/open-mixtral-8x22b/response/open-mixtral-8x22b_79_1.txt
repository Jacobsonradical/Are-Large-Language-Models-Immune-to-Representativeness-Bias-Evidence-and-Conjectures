To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

Let A be the event that we drew from Deck A, and B be the event that we drew from Deck B.

P(3X, 1O | A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. Since the draws are independent, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in any order is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1. However, since the order in which we draw the cards does not matter, we need to account for all possible orders in which we could draw 3 X cards and 1 O card. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose which of the 4 cards will be the O card, so the total probability is 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

Similarly, P(3X, 1O | B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. Again, since the draws are independent, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in any order is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose which of the 4 cards will be the O card, so the total probability is 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
= [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Assuming that the prior odds P(A) / P(B) are 1 (i.e., we have no reason to believe that one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other), we can simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = [4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= [4 * (8/27) * (1/3)] / [4 * (1/27) * (2/3)]
= [32/81] / [2/27]
= [32/81] * [27/2]
= 16/3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 16:3.

{odds: 16/3}
