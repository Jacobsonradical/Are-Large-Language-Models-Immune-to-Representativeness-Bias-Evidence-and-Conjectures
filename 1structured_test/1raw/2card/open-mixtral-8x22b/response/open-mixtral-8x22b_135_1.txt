To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X), where X is the evidence that we observed (3 X cards and 1 O card).

First, let's compute the likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck. Recall that the likelihood is the probability of observing the evidence given a hypothesis.

P(X|A) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck A. Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, we can calculate this likelihood as follows:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

P(X|B) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck B. Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, we can calculate this likelihood as follows:

P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is 1 (i.e., both decks are equally likely to be chosen). Then, the posterior odds can be computed as follows:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds
               = P(X|A) / P(X|B) * 1

Let's compute the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(X|A) / P(X|B)
                  = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
                  = (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^0 / (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^0
                  = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2
                  = (4/9) / (1/9)
                  = 4

Since the prior odds is 1, the posterior odds is equal to the likelihood ratio, which is 4.

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
