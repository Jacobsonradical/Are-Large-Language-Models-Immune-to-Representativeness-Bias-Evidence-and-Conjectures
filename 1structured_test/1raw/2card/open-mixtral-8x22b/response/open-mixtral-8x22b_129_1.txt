{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

2. For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is:
   (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/27 * 1/3 * 4 = 32/81

3. For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is:
   (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 1/27 * 2/3 * 4 = 8/81

4. Since we don't have any prior information on which deck is more likely, we can assume equal prior probabilities (1/2 for each deck).

5. Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B is the ratio of their probabilities given the evidence:
   Posterior odds (A/B) = P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence) = [P(evidence|A) * P(A)] / [P(evidence|B) * P(B)]

6. Plugging in the values, we get:
   Posterior odds (A/B) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 / 8/8 = 4 / 1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1, or simply 4. However, since the question asks for "odds" and not "odds ratio", we need to provide the odds as a single number. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8 (which is the numerator of the odds ratio).
