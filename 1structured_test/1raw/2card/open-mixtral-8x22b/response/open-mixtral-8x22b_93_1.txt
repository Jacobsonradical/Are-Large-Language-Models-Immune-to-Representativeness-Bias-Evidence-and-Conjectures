To calculate the posterior odds, we will use Bayes' theorem. We are given that the prior odds of selecting either deck is 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen). We are also given the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(D = A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(D = B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(D = A|3X,1O) / P(D = B|3X,1O) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A, compared to deck B, are 4:1.
