To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|E)/P(B|E), where E is the evidence that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X.

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are both equal to 1/2, since the deck is chosen randomly.

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values we have:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) * (1/2)]

The (4 choose 3) terms cancel out, as do the (1/2) terms. Simplifying the expression, we get:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3 = 2^3 = 8

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 8:1.

Answer:
{odds: 8}
