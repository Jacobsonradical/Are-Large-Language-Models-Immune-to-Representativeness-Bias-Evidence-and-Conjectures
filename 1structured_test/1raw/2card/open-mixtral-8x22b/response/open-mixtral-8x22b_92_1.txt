To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. Let D represent the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

The posterior odds of A to B are given by:

Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)

Since the decks were chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, let's compute P(D|A) and P(D|B).

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Assuming a large number of cards in Deck A, this can be approximated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can compute the posterior odds:

Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)
= [(4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2] / [(4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2]
= [(2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3] * [(1/3) / (2/3)]
= 8 * (1/2)
= 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
