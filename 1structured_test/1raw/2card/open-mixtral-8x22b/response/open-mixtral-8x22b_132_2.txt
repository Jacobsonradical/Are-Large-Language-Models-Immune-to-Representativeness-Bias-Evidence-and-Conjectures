{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.
2. For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.
3. For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.
4. The odds of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A compared to Deck B is the ratio of their probabilities: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8.
5. Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
