To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- C as the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find P(A|C) / P(B|C), the posterior odds of A given C compared to B given C.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since one of the decks is selected by chance, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods P(C|A) and P(C|B).

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(C|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(C|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|C) = P(C|A) * P(A) / P(C)
P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / P(C)

Since P(C|A) = P(C|B), the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|C) / P(B|C) = P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

However, since we know that one deck has a higher proportion of X cards, we can update our calculation by considering the fact that drawing 3 X cards is more likely from Deck A than Deck B. Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from each deck:

P(3X|A) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
P(3X|B) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X|A) / P(3X|B) = (8/27) / (1/27) = 8

Multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds = 8 * 1 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8:1.

{odds: 8}
