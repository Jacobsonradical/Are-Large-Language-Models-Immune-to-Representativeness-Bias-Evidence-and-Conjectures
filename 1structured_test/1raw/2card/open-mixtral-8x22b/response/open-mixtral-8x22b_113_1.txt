To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
The probability of drawing one O card is (1/3).
The probability of drawing three X cards is (2/3)^3.
So, the likelihood of drawing this particular combination from Deck A is:
(1/3) * (2/3)^3

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
The probability of drawing one O card is (2/3).
The probability of drawing three X cards is (1/3)^3.
So, the likelihood of drawing this particular combination from Deck B is:
(2/3) * (1/3)^3

The prior odds for Deck A and Deck B are 1:1, since either deck could have been chosen with equal probability.

So, the posterior odds for Deck A compared to Deck B are:
(likelihood of drawing 3X,1O from Deck A) / (likelihood of drawing 3X,1O from Deck B)
= [(1/3) * (2/3)^3] / [(2/3) * (1/3)^3]
= (8/27) / (2/27)
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
