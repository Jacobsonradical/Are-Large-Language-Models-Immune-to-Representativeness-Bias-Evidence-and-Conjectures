To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can use a simplified version of it since we are dealing with a discrete case and we are only interested in the ratio of probabilities.

The posterior odds are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The prior odds are simply the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, which is 1/1 since both decks are chosen with equal probability (by chance).

To calculate the likelihood ratio, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The likelihood ratio, LR, is given by:
LR = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Since the prior odds are 1/1, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
