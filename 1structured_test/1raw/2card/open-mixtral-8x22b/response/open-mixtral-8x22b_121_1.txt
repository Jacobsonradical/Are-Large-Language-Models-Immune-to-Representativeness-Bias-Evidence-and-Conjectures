To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
   P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

2. Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
   P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

3. Calculate the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B:
   Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1 (which can also be written as 1/1).

4. Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
   Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds
   Likelihood ratio = P(3 X, 1 O | Deck A) / P(3 X, 1 O | Deck B)
   Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] * 1

5. Calculate the posterior odds:
   Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
   Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27)
   Posterior odds = 8/2 * 27/27
   Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
