To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

The prior odds for drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is 1:1, since either deck has an equal chance of being selected.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O card from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihood of the data given A to the likelihood of the data given B:
Likelihood ratio = (Likelihood of 3 X and 1 O given A) / (Likelihood of 3 X and 1 O given B)
Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Since the prior odds is 1:1, the posterior odds is also equal to the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
