To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Let's denote:
- D_A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- D_B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- E as the evidence that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X.

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is 1:1, since the decks were chosen by chance. So, the prior odds ratio is:
P(D_A) / P(D_B) = 1 / 1 = 1

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the probability of the evidence given each deck divided by the probability of the evidence given the other deck:

P(E | D_A) / P(E | D_B)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(E | D_A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (8/27) * (1/3) * 4 = 32/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(E | D_B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = (1/27) * (2/3) * 4 = 8/81

So, the likelihood ratio is:
P(E | D_A) / P(E | D_B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

Finally, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 4:1.
