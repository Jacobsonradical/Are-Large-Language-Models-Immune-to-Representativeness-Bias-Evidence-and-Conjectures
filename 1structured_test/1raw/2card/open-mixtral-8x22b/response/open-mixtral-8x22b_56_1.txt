To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the posterior odds, which are defined as the ratio of the probabilities of the two hypotheses (deck A and deck B) given the observed data (three X cards and one O card).

Let's denote the two hypotheses as A and B, where A represents the event that deck A was selected, and B represents the event that deck B was selected. The observed data, which we'll call D, consists of drawing three X cards and one O card.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) * P(A) / P(B)

This equation tells us that the posterior odds (P(A|D) / P(B|D)) are equal to the likelihood ratio (P(D|A) / P(D|B)) multiplied by the prior odds (P(A) / P(B)). Since the decks were chosen by chance, the prior probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B are both 1/2, so the prior odds are 1.

Now we need to calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the data given each hypothesis. The probability of drawing three X cards and one O card from deck A is:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

The probability of drawing the same configuration from deck B is:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

The likelihood ratio is:

P(D|A) / P(D|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (3/1)^3 * (3/2) = 4

Since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
