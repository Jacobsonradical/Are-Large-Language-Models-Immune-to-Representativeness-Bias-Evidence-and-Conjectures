To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. The observed data is that 3 out of 4 cards are marked X, which we'll denote as D.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of A given D is equal to the prior odds of A times the likelihood ratio:

posterior odds = prior odds * likelihood ratio

Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds of A is 1 (or 1:1).

The likelihood ratio is the probability of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given Deck A, divided by the probability of observing the data given Deck B.

Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate these probabilities.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The likelihood ratio is then:

likelihood ratio = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = 8:1

Multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio gives the posterior odds:

posterior odds = 1 * 8 = 8:1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data, are 8:1 compared to Deck B.
