{odds: 8}

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote A as the event of drawing from Deck A, and B as the event of drawing from Deck B. Let's denote X as the evidence of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) / P(X|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since both decks have an equal chance of being selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

[P(X|A) / P(X|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)] = (8/81) / (2/81) * (1/2) / (1/2) = 8/2 = 4

However, since the question asks for the odds and not the ratio, the posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of Deck A.

Therefore, the answer is {odds: 8}.
