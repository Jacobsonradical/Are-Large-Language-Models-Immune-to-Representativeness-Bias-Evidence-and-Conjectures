To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of Deck A (A) given the evidence (E) is the likelihood of the evidence given Deck A (P(E|A)) multiplied by the prior odds of Deck A (P(A)), divided by the likelihood of the evidence given Deck B (P(E|B)) multiplied by the prior odds of Deck B (P(B)).

Since Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen, their prior odds are equal, and the prior odds ratio P(A)/P(B) is 1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence given Deck A and Deck B.

For Deck A, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds ratio:
Posterior odds = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B) = (8/81) * 1 / (2/81) * 1 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
