{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.
2. The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A (P(D_A)):
   P(D_A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
3. The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B (P(D_B)):
   P(D_B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
4. Now, let's find the prior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1 or simply 1.
5. To find the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the ratio of the likelihoods:
   Posterior odds = Prior odds * P(D_A) / P(D_B)
   = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
   = 4
6. However, in this problem, we are asked for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, not the ratio of posterior probabilities. Since the prior odds were 1:1, the posterior odds are also 16:1, or simply 16.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 16.
