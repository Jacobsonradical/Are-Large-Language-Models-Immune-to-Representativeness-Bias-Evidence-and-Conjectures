To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 32/81
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

We assume that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

P(data) is the probability of getting the observed data regardless of which deck was chosen, and it is the same for both decks, so it cancels out when we take the ratio of the posteriors:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Substitute the values we found earlier:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (32/81 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2) = 32/8

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
