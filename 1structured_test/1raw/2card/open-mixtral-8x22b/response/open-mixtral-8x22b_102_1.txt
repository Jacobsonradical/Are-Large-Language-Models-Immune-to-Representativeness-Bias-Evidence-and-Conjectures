To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are defined as the product of the likelihood ratio and the prior odds.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of observing the given data (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck. For Deck A, the probability is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, and for Deck B, the probability is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B before observing any data. Since both decks are equally likely to be selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1.

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] * 1
= [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]
= 4/1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
