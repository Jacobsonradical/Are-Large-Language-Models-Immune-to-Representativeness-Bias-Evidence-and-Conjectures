To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(A) = 1/2 (since there's an equal chance of choosing either deck)
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (since 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O)

For Deck B:
P(B) = 1/2
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (since 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of having chosen Deck A given the drawn cards:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)

Since P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B), we have:

P(3X, 1O) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2) = 10/162

So, P(A | 3X, 1O) = (8/81) * (1/2) / (10/162) = 8/10 = 4/5

Similarly, we can find the posterior probability of having chosen Deck B:

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O) = (2/81) * (1/2) / (10/162) = 2/10 = 1/5

Finally, the posterior odds of having chosen Deck A compared to Deck B are:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

So the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A.
