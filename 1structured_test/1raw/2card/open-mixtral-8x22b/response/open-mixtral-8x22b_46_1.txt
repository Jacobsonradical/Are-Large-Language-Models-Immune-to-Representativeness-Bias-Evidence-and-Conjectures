{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. The probability of the observed outcome (3 X cards and 1 O card) is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. The probability of the observed outcome is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

Now, let's calculate the prior odds. Since each deck has an equal chance of being selected, the prior odds are 1:1.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = prior odds * (likelihood of Deck A / likelihood of Deck B)
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds = 81

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 81:1.
