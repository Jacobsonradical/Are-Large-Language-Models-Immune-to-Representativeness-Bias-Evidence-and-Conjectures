To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A as the event that deck A was chosen
B as the event that deck B was chosen
E as the evidence that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

First, we calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, assuming we draw 4 cards.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/27 * 1/3 * 4 = 32/81

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 1/27 * 2/3 * 4 = 8/81

Since each deck was chosen by chance, the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Substitute the values we found:

Posterior odds = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 * 81/81 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
