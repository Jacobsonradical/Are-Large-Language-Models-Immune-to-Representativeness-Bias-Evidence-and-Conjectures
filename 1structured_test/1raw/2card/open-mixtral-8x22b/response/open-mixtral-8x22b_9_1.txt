To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that Deck A is chosen, and B be the event that Deck B is chosen. Let X be the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X. We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities P(A|X) and P(B|X).

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), which are both 0.5 since either deck can be chosen with equal probability.

Next, we calculate the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B). Since Deck A has 2/3 X cards and 1/3 O cards, and Deck B has 1/3 X cards and 2/3 O cards, we have:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * Choose(4,3) = 32/81
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * Choose(4,3) = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities P(A|X) and P(B|X):

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Since P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, and P(X) is the sum of the probabilities of event X occurring given either deck is chosen (which is the same as the sum of the likelihoods), we have:

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2) = 20/81

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)] / [P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)]
= [(32/81) * (1/2) / (20/81)] / [(8/81) * (1/2) / (20/81)]
= (32/40) / (8/40) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
