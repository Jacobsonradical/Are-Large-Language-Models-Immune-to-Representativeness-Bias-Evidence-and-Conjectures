To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let D be the observed data, which is that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of A given D is equal to the prior odds of A times the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

The prior odds of A is simply the ratio of the probability of A to the probability of B, which is 1, since we have no prior information about which deck was chosen.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of observing D given A to the probability of observing D given B.

Let's calculate the probability of observing D given A:

P(D|A) = (Probability of drawing an X from Deck A)^3 * (Probability of drawing an O from Deck A)^1
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Now let's calculate the probability of observing D given B:

P(D|B) = (Probability of drawing an X from Deck B)^3 * (Probability of drawing an O from Deck B)^1
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(D|A) / P(D|B)
Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
Likelihood ratio = (2^3 / 3^3) * (1/3) / (1/3^3) * (2/3)
Likelihood ratio = (8/27) * (1/3) / (1/27) * (2/3)
Likelihood ratio = (8/27) * (27/3) / (2/3)
Likelihood ratio = 4/1

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 4/1

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 4:1, compared to Deck B.
