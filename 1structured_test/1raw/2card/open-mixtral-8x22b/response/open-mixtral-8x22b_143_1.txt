To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the evidence (E) of 3 X cards and 1 O card can be written as:

Odds(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B)

Here, P(E|A) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck A was chosen, and P(E|B) is the probability of observing the same given that Deck B was chosen. P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the decks were chosen by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now let's calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B):

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

However, since the combinations are the same for both decks, we can simplify the expression:

Odds(A|E) = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = 1

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 1:1, meaning that given the evidence, the probability of having chosen Deck A is the same as the probability of having chosen Deck B.
