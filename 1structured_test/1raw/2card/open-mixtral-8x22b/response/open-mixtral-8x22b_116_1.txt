To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, since the decks were chosen by chance, we can assume equal prior probabilities for both decks, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability for each deck:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Since P(3X, 1O) is the same for both calculations, we can ignore it for the purpose of calculating the posterior odds. Thus, we have:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values we have:

Posterior odds = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

In the requested format:
{odds: 4}
