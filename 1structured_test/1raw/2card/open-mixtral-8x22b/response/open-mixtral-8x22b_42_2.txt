To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are looking for the ratio of the probabilities of Deck A and Deck B, given the evidence of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A, which is 1/2 since one deck is chosen at random.
- P(B) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B, which is also 1/2.
- P(E|A) as the probability of observing the evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card) given that Deck A was chosen.
- P(E|B) as the probability of observing the evidence given that Deck B was chosen.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A over B is given by:

Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [P(A) * P(E|A)] / [P(B) * P(E|B)]

First, let's calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B):

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 1) = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 1) = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [(1/2) * (8/81)] / [(1/2) * (8/81)] = 1

However, the calculation above is incorrect because the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is not the same as from Deck B. Let's correct this:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 32/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

Now the posterior odds are:

Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [(1/2) * (32/81)] / [(1/2) * (8/81)] = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

Final answer:
{odds: 4}
