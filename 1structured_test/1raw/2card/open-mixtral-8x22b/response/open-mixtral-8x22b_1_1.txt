To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that Deck A is chosen.
- B: The event that Deck B is chosen.
- E: The evidence that 3 out of 4 cards are X and 1 is O.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|E) and P(B|E). According to Bayes' theorem, these are:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since the decks were chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now we need to find P(E|A) and P(E|B), the probability of observing the evidence given that Deck A or Deck B was chosen, respectively.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in 4 draws is given by the binomial distribution:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in 4 draws is:

P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can compute the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E)
     = [P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)]
     = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|B) * P(B)
     = [(4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
     = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3
     = 2^3
     = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8:1 compared to Deck B.

Final answer:
{odds: 8}
