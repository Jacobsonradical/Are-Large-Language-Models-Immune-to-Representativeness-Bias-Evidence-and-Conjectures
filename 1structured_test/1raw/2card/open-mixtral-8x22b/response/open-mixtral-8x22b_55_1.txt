To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given that 3 out of 4 cards are marked X, is equal to the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck A multiplied by the prior odds of Deck A, divided by the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards from Deck B multiplied by the prior odds of Deck B.

The prior odds of Deck A and Deck B are equal since each deck was chosen with equal probability (1/2).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:
P(A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
P(B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) * Prior odds
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81) * (1/2) / (1/2)
Posterior odds = 32/8 * 1/1
Posterior odds = 4

So the posterior odds are 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A, compared to Deck B.
