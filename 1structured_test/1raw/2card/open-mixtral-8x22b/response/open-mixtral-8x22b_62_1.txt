{odds: 9}

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D as the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card)

The posterior odds of A to B is given by:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) \* P(A)] / [P(D|B) \* P(B)]

Assuming that Deck A and Deck B were equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B).

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. It can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) \* (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 4 \* 8/27 \* 1/3 = 32/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. It can be calculated similarly:

P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) \* (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 4 \* 1/27 \* 2/3 = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) \* P(A)] / [P(D|B) \* P(B)] = (32/81 \* 1/2) / (8/81 \* 1/2) = 4

However, we are asked for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, which is the reciprocal of the posterior probability ratio:

Posterior odds = 1 / (P(A|D) / P(B|D)) = 1 / 4 = 9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 9 to 1.
