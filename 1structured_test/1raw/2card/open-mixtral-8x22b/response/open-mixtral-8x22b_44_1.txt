To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

P(E|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

P(E|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now, assuming that the prior odds of selecting either deck were equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(E|A) / P(E|B) * P(A) / P(B) = (32/81) / (8/81) * (1/2) / (1/2) = 32/8 * 1 * 1 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.
