To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A and the event of drawing from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data), where "data" refers to the observation of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

The likelihood of observing this data given that we drew from Deck A, P(data|A), is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Similarly, P(data|B) is the probability of observing the same data given that we drew from Deck B.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are both equal to 1/2, since we are selecting one of the decks by chance.

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

Since we don't know the overall probability of observing the data, P(data), we can leave it out when calculating the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

Posterior odds = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
