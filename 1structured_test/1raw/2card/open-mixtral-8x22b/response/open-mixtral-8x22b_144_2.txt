To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is 1 (since no additional information is given, we assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen).

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A to the probability of drawing the same combination from Deck B.

Let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A versus Deck B is:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
