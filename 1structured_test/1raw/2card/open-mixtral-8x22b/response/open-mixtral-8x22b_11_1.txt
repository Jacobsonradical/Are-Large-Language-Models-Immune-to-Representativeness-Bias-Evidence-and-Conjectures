{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the odds for P(A|D) / P(B|D).

First, let's find the likelihood of observing the data D given that the cards were drawn from Deck A (P(D|A)) and Deck B (P(D|B)):

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Next, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting either deck is equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the prior probabilities are equal, we can focus on the likelihood ratios:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)

The 1/2 terms cancel out, and we are left with:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 8/2 = 4

However, since we are looking for odds, we need to compare the probability of the event A happening (selecting Deck A) to the probability of the event A not happening (selecting Deck B). Therefore, we compare P(A|D) to P(B|D):

Odds = P(A|D) / (1 - P(A|D))

Since P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4, this means that P(A|D) = 4 * P(B|D). Plugging this into the odds formula, we get:

Odds = 4 * P(B|D) / (1 - 4 * P(B|D))

Given that P(B|D) + P(A|D) = 1, we can express P(B|D) as 1/(1 + 4) = 1/5. Substituting this into the odds formula, we get:

Odds = 4 * (1/5) / (1 - 4 * (1/5)) = 4/5 / (1/5) = 4

Since the odds are expressed as a single number, we have:
