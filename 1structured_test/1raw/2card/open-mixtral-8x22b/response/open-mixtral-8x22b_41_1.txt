To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of A (deck A was chosen) versus B (deck B was chosen) given the evidence (4 cards drawn, 3 marked X, 1 marked O) is:

Odds(A|evidence) / Odds(B|evidence) = P(evidence|A) * P(A) / P(evidence|B) * P(B)

Assuming that each deck was equally likely to be chosen a priori, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now we calculate the likelihood of the evidence given each deck.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:
P(evidence|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:
P(evidence|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The posterior odds are:
Odds(A|evidence) / Odds(B|evidence) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

This simplifies to:
Odds(A|evidence) / Odds(B|evidence) = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
