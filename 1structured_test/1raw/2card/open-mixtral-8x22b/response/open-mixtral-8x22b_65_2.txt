To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- A: Event that deck A is chosen.
- B: Event that deck B is chosen.
- E: Event that 3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of A and B given event E:

Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Given that either deck A or deck B is chosen with equal probability:

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Now let's calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B).

For deck A:
P(E|A) = P(3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn from deck A)
= (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * [4! / (3! * 1!)]
= 8/27

For deck B:
P(E|B) = P(3 X cards and 1 O card are drawn from deck B)
= (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * [4! / (3! * 1!)]
= 2/27

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [(8/27) * 0.5] / [(2/27) * 0.5]
= 8/2
= 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
