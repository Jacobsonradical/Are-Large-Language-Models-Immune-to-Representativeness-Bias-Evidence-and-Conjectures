{odds: 81}

To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where the data is the observation of 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find the likelihood of the data given A and B:

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, let's find the prior probabilities for A and B:

P(A) = 1/2 (since either deck is chosen with equal probability)
P(B) = 1/2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

Since P(data) is the same for both A and B, it will cancel out when we take the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|B) * P(B))

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

= ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2))

= 81

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 81:1.
