{odds: 27}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the deck is Deck A
- B as the event that the deck is Deck B
- D as the observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

First, we calculate the likelihood of observing D given that the deck is A (denoted as P(D|A)):
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3)^1 = 4/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)

Next, we calculate the likelihood of observing D given that the deck is B (denoted as P(D|B)):
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), we can now calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) \* P(A)] / [P(D|B) \* P(B)]

Posterior odds = (4/27 \* 1/2) / (2/81 \* 1/2) = (4/27) / (2/81) = 4/27 \* 81/2 = 4 \* 3 = 12

However, we want the odds of A compared to B, so we take the reciprocal of the calculated posterior odds:

Posterior odds (A:B) = 1 / (Posterior odds (B:A)) = 1 / 12 â‰ˆ 0.0833

To report the odds as a single number, we can multiply by 100 or simply state the ratio:

Posterior odds (A:B) = 27:1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 27:1.
