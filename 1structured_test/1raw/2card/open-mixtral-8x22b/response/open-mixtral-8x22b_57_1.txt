To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we're interested in the posterior odds of the decks given the drawn cards.

Let's denote:
- A as the event of choosing Deck A,
- B as the event of choosing Deck B,
- E as the evidence (3 X cards and 1 O card being drawn).

We want to find P(A|E)/P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of choosing Deck A given the evidence E, compared to choosing Deck B given the same evidence.

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = P(E|A)P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B)P(B) / P(E)

Since the decks are chosen by chance, it's reasonable to assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence given each deck:

- P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

- P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A)P(A) / P(E)] / [P(E|B)P(B) / P(E)] = P(E|A)P(A) / P(E|B)P(B) = (8/81) * 0.5 / (2/81) * 0.5 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
