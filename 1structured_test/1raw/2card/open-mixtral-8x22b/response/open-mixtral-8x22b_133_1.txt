{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. We want to find the ratio of the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the evidence (P(A|E)) to the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck B given the evidence (P(B|E)).

1. Prior odds: Since either deck can be chosen with equal probability, the prior odds of choosing Deck A or Deck B are even (1:1).

2. Likelihood ratio: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81.

3. Posterior odds: Multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds = 8/2
Posterior odds = 4

So, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.

However, since the question asks for a single number, we can express this as the ratio 8 (4:1 reduced to its simplest form).
