To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, as the deck was chosen by chance.

Let D represent the data, which consists of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data.

First, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 1/3. Using the binomial distribution, we get:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. The probability of drawing an X card from Deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O card is 2/3. Using the binomial distribution, we get:

P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) = P(A) * P(D|A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(B) * P(D|B) / P(D)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can cancel out P(D) and P(B) from the equation, and we get:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(A) * P(D|A) / (P(B) * P(D|B)) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
