To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the odds in favor of Deck A given the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81.

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81.

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal (1:1), since no additional information is given.

Then, the posterior odds can be calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio of the evidence for each deck.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihood of the evidence given Deck A to the likelihood of the evidence given Deck B:

Likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are also 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

So, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
