To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X as the observation that 3 of the 4 cards drawn are X and 1 is O.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|X) / P(B|X).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B).

Since the cards are drawn with replacement (or the decks are very large, so the probabilities remain constant), we can use the binomial distribution.

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which has a probability of 2/3 for X and 1/3 for O.

P(X|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which has a probability of 1/3 for X and 2/3 for O.

P(X|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now let's assume that the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(X|A) / P(X|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Posterior odds = [(32/81) / (8/81)] * [(1/2) / (1/2)]

Posterior odds = (32/8) * 1

Posterior odds = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
