To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that Deck A was chosen
- B as the event that Deck B was chosen
- X as the observation of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We want to find the odds of A given X (posterior odds), which can be expressed as:

Odds(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X|B) * P(B)

Since the deck was chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B):

P(X|A) can be calculated using the binomial distribution. The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:

P(X|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
       = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3)
       = 32/81

P(X|B) can be calculated similarly:

P(X|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
       = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
       = 8/81

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A|X) = (32/81) * 0.5 / (8/81) * 0.5
          = 32/8 * 1/1
          = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
