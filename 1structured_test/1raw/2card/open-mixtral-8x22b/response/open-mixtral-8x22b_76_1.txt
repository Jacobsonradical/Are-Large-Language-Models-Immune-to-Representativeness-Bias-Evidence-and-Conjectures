{odds: 27}

Explanation:

To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can use a shortcut by considering the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Deck A has a higher proportion of X's, so it's more likely to draw 3 X's and 1 O from it than from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

The ratio of these probabilities gives us the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B:

((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1) = 8/1 = 8.

Since the decks were chosen by chance, the prior odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1 (equal probability).

Therefore, the posterior odds is 8 times the prior odds, which is 8 * 1 = 8.

However, this answer assumes that the order of drawing the cards does not matter. Since the order does matter, we need to account for the different ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A, there are 4 ways to draw 3 X's and 1 O (XXXO, XXOX, XOXX, OXXX).

For Deck B, there is only 1 way to draw 3 X's and 1 O (XXXO).

Therefore, the posterior odds is 8 * 4 / 1 = 32.

However, since we are looking for the odds, and not the probability, we need to adjust for the fact that there are 4 cards drawn. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is 4 times higher than from Deck B, but since we are looking for the odds, we need to square this ratio, because the odds of an event is the ratio of its probability to the probability of its complement.

Therefore, the posterior odds is (4^2) * 8 = 128.

However, since we are only asked for the odds, and not the probability, we need to adjust for the fact that there are 4 cards drawn. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is 4 times higher than from Deck B, but since we are looking for the odds, we need to square this ratio, because the odds of an event is the ratio of its probability to the probability of its complement.

Therefore, the posterior odds is (4^2) * 8 = 128.
