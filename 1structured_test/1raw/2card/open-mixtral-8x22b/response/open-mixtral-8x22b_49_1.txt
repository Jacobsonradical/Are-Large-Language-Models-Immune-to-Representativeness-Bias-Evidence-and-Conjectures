To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the events:

A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
E: 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn.

We want to find P(A|E)/P(B|E), the posterior odds of A given E, compared to B given E.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A)P(A)/P(E), and similarly for P(B|E). So we have:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A)P(A)/P(E)] / [P(E|B)P(B)/P(E)] = P(E|A)P(A) / P(E|B)P(B)

Since the decks were chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we need to calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B). These are the probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A, the probability of drawing an X card is 2/3 and an O card is 1/3. Using the binomial distribution, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3)(2/3)^3(1/3)^1 = 4*(8/27)*(1/3) = 32/81

For Deck B, the probability of drawing an X card is 1/3 and an O card is 2/3. Using the binomial distribution:

P(E|B) = (4 choose 3)(1/3)^3(2/3)^1 = 4*(1/27)*(2/3) = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = P(E|A)P(A) / P(E|B)P(B) = (32/81)*0.5 / (8/81)*0.5 = 32/8 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Final answer: {odds: 4}
