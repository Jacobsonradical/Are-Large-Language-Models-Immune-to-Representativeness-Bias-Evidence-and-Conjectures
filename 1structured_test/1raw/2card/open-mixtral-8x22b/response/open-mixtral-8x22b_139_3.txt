To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that Deck A is chosen
- B as the event that Deck B is chosen
- X as the observation that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities P(A|X) and P(B|X).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B). These are the probabilities of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that we are drawing from Deck A or Deck B, respectively.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Here, P(X) is the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, regardless of which deck is chosen. We can calculate P(X) as:

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2) = 5/81

Now we can find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|X) = (8/81) * (1/2) / (5/81) = 8/10
P(B|X) = (2/81) * (1/2) / (5/81) = 2/10

Finally, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4/1

Therefore, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.
