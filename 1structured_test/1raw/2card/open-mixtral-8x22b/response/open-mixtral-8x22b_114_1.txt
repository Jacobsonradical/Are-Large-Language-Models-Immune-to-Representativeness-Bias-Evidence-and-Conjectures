To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

A: The event that deck A was chosen.
B: The event that deck B was chosen.
D: The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds are given by:

Odds(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, as deck A and deck B are equally likely to be chosen (by chance).
2. P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

3. P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. Similarly, this can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)
= (32/81) * 0.5 / (8/81) * 0.5
= 32/8 / 8/81
= 32 * 81 / 8 * 8
= 4 * 81 / 64
= 324 / 64
= 162 / 32
= 5.0625

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are approximately 5.0625 to 1.

Answer: {odds: 5.0625}
