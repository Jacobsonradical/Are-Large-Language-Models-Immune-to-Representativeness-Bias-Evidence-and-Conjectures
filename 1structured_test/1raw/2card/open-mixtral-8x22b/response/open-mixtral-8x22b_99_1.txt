{odds: 81}

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the likelihood ratio (LR). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, and from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

LR = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = 8

Since the decks are equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds are 1:1.

The posterior odds are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 81 = 81

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 81:1.
