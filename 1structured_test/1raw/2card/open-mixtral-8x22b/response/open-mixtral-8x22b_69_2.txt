To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. The probabilities of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = P(3 X cards and 1 O card | Deck A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D|B) = P(3 X cards and 1 O card | Deck B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values we have:

Posterior odds = [(4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]

The (4 choose 3) and (1/2) terms cancel out since they are common to both the numerator and the denominator:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2] = [(4/9)] / [(1/9)] = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
