{odds: 81/1}

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start by setting up the likelihood and prior probabilities.

Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The prior probabilities are:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen by chance, there's an equal probability for both decks)

The likelihoods are calculated as follows:
- For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O), the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
- For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O), the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [P(A) * Likelihood(3X,1O|A)] / [P(B) * Likelihood(3X,1O|B)]

Plugging in the values:
Posterior odds = [0.5 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [0.5 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplifying:
Posterior odds = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4/1

However, since we are drawing 4 cards, we need to square the odds for each draw:
Posterior odds = (4/1)^4 = 81/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 81:1.
