To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that Deck A was chosen.
- B as the event that Deck B was chosen.
- D as the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

We want to find the posterior odds O(A:B|D), which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of observing the data D given that either Deck A or Deck B was chosen:

P(D|A) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck A)
       = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3)  (C(4,3) is the number of combinations of 3 X's out of 4 cards)
       = 8/27 * 4/3
       = 32/81

P(D|B) = P(3 X's and 1 O | Deck B)
       = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3)
       = 1/27 * 4/3
       = 4/81

Now, let's assume that Deck A and Deck B were equally likely to be chosen a priori, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
       ≈ P(D|A) * P(A) / (P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B))
       = (32/81) * (1/2) / ((32/81) * (1/2) + (4/81) * (1/2))
       = 32 / (32 + 4)
       = 8 / 9

P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)
       ≈ P(D|B) * P(B) / (P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B))
       = (4/81) * (1/2) / ((32/81) * (1/2) + (4/81) * (1/2))
       = 4 / (32 + 4)
       = 1 / 9

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

O(A:B|D) = P(A|D) / P(B|D)
          = (8/9) / (1/9)
          = 8

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 8:1.

Answer: {odds: 8}
