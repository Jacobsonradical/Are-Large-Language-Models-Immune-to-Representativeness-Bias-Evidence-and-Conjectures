To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities P(A|data) and P(B|data).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Assuming that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

Since P(A) = P(B), the common factor P(data) in the denominator cancels out, and the posterior odds are simply the ratio of the likelihoods:
Posterior odds = P(data|A) / P(data|B)

Substituting the likelihoods we calculated earlier:
Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Simplifying the expression:
Posterior odds = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 = 4/1

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
