To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can also use a more intuitive approach because the odds of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card are vastly different between the two decks.

Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the likelihood ratio (also known as the Bayes factor) is:
Likelihood ratio = P(A) / P(B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

This means that observing 3 X cards and 1 O card is 4 times more likely if the cards were drawn from Deck A than if they were drawn from Deck B.

Since the decks were chosen by chance with equal probability (1/2 for each deck), the prior odds are 1 (or 1:1). Multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio gives us the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
