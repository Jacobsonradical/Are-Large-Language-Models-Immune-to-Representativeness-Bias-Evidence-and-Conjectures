To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds of an event A (deck A being chosen) given an observation (3 X's and 1 O) is equal to the prior odds of the event A, multiplied by the likelihood ratio. In this case, we have two competing hypotheses: deck A and deck B.

First, let's find the prior odds of picking deck A vs deck B. Since there's no prior information, we can assume that the odds of picking either deck are equal, so the prior odds are 1 (or 1:1).

Next, let's compute the likelihood ratio. This is given by the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O when deck A is chosen, divided by the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O when deck B is chosen.

Let's first compute the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. The probability of drawing an X from deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Now let's compute the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. The probability of drawing an X from deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

P(3X, 1O | deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now we can compute the likelihood ratio:

Likelihood ratio = P(3X, 1O | deck A) / P(3X, 1O | deck B)

Plugging in the values we found earlier, we get:

Likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = 8/1

Now we can find the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio

Posterior odds = 1 * 8/1 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A, given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O, are 8:1.

Answer:
{odds: 8}
