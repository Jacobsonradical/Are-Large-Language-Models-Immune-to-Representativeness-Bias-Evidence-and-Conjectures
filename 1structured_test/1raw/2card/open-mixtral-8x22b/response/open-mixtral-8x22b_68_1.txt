To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The odds are defined as the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. In this case, the events are drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- Event A: Deck A is chosen
- Event B: Deck B is chosen
- Event X: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the odds of event A given event X, denoted as O(A|X). This is equivalent to the ratio of the probabilities P(A|X)/P(B|X).

First, let's find the likelihoods P(X|A) and P(X|B), which are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since either deck can be chosen with equal probability, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

O(A|X) = P(A|X) / P(B|X)
       = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
       = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)
       = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
