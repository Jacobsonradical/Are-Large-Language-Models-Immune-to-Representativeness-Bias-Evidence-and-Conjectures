{odds: 81}

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the deck is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck is Deck B. Also, let X be the event that we draw 3 X cards and 1 O card.

The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B before drawing any cards, which is 1:1 or simply 1, since both decks are selected with equal probability.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(X|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is given by:

P(X|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

The posterior odds are then given by:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
               = 1 * (P(X|A) / P(X|B))
               = 1 * (32/81) / (8/81)
               = 32/8 * 81/81
               = 4 * 1
               = 4

Since the posterior odds are 4:1, this means the probability of having drawn from Deck A is 4 times the probability of having drawn from Deck B. However, since we are asked for the odds, not the probability, the answer is:

{odds: 81}

This is because the odds are calculated as the ratio of probabilities, which in this case is 4:1, but the odds are usually expressed in the form of a single number, where the numerator is the probability of the desired event and the denominator is the probability of the alternative event. So the odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 81:1.
