To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds of an event A, given evidence B, is equal to the likelihood of B given A, times the prior odds of A.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- E as the observed evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

The likelihood of E given A, P(E|A), is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. Using the binomial probability formula, this is:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

Similarly, the likelihood of E given B, P(E|B), is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

The prior odds of A, P(A)/P(B), is the ratio of the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, which is 1/1 = 1, since both decks were chosen with equal probability.

Therefore, the posterior odds of A given E, P(A|E)/P(B|E), is:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A)/P(E|B)] * [P(A)/P(B)] = (32/81) / (8/81) * 1 = 32/8 = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the evidence, is 4.
