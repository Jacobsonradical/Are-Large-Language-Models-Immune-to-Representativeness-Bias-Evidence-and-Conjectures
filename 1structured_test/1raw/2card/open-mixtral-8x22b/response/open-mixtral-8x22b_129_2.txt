To calculate the posterior odds, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that Deck A was chosen and B as the event that Deck B was chosen. We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|data) / P(B|data).

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X card is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing an O card is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X card is 1/3.
- The probability of drawing an O card is 2/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the two likelihoods:

likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Since the decks are chosen by chance, the prior probabilities are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2). Therefore, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio.

likelihood ratio = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]
= [(2/3)^2] / [(1/3)^2]
= (4/9) / (1/9)
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
