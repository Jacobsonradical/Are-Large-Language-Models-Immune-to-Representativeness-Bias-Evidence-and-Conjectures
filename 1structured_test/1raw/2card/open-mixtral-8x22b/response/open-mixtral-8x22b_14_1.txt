To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of A (deck A) versus B (deck B) given the evidence (4 cards drawn with 3 X's and 1 O) is:

odds = P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence)

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(evidence|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 32/81
P(evidence|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/81

Now, let's assume that the prior probability of selecting either deck is equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), since the deck is chosen by chance.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability of each deck given the evidence:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|A) * P(A) / P(evidence)
P(B|evidence) = P(evidence|B) * P(B) / P(evidence)

Since P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we can simplify the formula:

P(A|evidence) = P(evidence|A) / (P(evidence|A) + P(evidence|B))
P(B|evidence) = P(evidence|B) / (P(evidence|A) + P(evidence|B))

Substituting the values we found earlier:

P(A|evidence) = 32/81 / ((32/81) + (8/81)) = 32/40
P(B|evidence) = 8/81 / ((32/81) + (8/81)) = 8/40

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

odds = P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence) = (32/40) / (8/40) = 32/8 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
