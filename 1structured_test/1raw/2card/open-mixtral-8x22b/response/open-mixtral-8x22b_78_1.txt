To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of being from Deck A versus Deck B is given by the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from Deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from Deck B, adjusted by the prior odds of Deck A and Deck B.

Let's assume that the prior odds of Deck A and Deck B are equal, since there is no additional information given about the selection of the decks. Therefore, the prior odds are 1:1, or just 1.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Since we assumed that the prior odds P(A) and P(B) are equal, they cancel out, and we are left with:

Posterior odds = P(X|A) / P(X|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data, is 4:1 compared to Deck B.
