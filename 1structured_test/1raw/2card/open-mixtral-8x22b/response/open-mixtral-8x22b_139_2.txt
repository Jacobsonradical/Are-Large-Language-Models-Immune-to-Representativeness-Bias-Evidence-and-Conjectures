To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A: Deck A was chosen
B: Deck B was chosen
X: 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn

We are asked to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), the posterior odds of A given X compared to B given X.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Since the decks were chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now we need to find P(X|A) and P(X|B), the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X)
= [P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)] / [P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)]
= [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
= [[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] * (1/2)] / [[(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] * (1/2)]
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
= (2/3)^3 * 2
= 8/27 * 2
= 16/27

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 16/27.

{odds: 16/27}
