To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are given by the product of the likelihood and the prior odds.

First, we calculate the likelihood for each deck. The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are 1:1, since both decks are chosen with equal probability.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds (A:B) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) * Prior odds (A:B)

Plugging in the values:

Posterior odds (A:B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] * 1

After simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds (A:B) = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 8:1.

{odds: 8}
