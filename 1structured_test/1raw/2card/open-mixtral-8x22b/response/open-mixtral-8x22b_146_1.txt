{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let A be the event that we drew from Deck A, and B be the event that we drew from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), the posterior odds of A given the observed data.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [ P(data|A) / P(data|B) ] * [ P(A) / P(B) ]

Here, P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since both decks were equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate P(data|A) and P(data|B), the likelihoods of observing the given data from each deck.

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [ (8/81) / (2/81) ] * [ 0.5 / 0.5 ] = 81

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data, are 81 compared to Deck B.
