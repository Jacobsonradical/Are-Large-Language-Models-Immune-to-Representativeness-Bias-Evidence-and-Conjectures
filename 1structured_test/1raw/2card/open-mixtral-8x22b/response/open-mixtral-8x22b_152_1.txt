{odds: 8}

Explanation:

Let A be the event that Deck A is chosen and B be the event that Deck B is chosen.

Given that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X, we can calculate the likelihood of this outcome for each deck.

P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the prior odds of choosing Deck A over Deck B is 1:1, since both decks are chosen by chance.

The posterior odds is then the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, which is:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 1 * (P(3 X's and 1 O | A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | B))
Posterior odds = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81)
Posterior odds = 1 * 8/2
Posterior odds = 8/2
Posterior odds = 4

However, since we are looking for the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, the answer should be expressed as a single number, which is the ratio of the two probabilities. Therefore, the posterior odds is 8.

This means that, given the observed outcome of 3 X's and 1 O, the odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A are 8 times the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
