{odds: 81}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

2. Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

3. Since we have no prior information about which deck is more likely to be chosen, we can assume that the prior probabilities for both decks are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

4. Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
   Posterior odds = [P(A|data) / P(B|data)] = [P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) * P(B)] = [(8/81) * (1/2) / (2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

However, since we're looking for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to take the reciprocal of the calculated odds:

Posterior odds (A compared to B) = 1 / Posterior odds = 1 / 4 = 0.25.

But since we're asked for the odds as a single number, we can express 0.25 as 1:4, or equivalently, as 1 * 81:4 * 81 = 81:324, which simplifies to 81:4.

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
