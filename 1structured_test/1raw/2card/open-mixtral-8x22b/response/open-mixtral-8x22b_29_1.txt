To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds of being from deck A versus deck B is given by the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from deck A divided by the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from deck B.

Let's denote:
- P(A) and P(B) as the prior probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B, which we can assume to be equal since one deck was selected by chance. Thus, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
- P(D|A) and P(D|B) as the probabilities of drawing the observed data (3 X's and 1 O) from deck A and deck B, respectively.

Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate these probabilities:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, the prior probabilities cancel out, and we are left with:

Posterior odds = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Calculating the binomial probabilities:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (8/27) * (1/3) = (4/1) * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/27) * (4/3) = (4/1) * (1/27) * (4/3) = 16/81

Finally, the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (32/81) / (16/81) = 32/16 = 2

So, the posterior odds are 2 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
