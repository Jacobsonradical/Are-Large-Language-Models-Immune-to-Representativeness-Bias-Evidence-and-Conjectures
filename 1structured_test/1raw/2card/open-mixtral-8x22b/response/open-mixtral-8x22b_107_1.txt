To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that Deck A was selected.
- B as the event that Deck B was selected.
- X as the evidence that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X), and similarly for P(B|X).

Since either Deck A or Deck B was selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B):

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:

P(X|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

                 = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]

                 = 32/8 * 1/1

                 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
