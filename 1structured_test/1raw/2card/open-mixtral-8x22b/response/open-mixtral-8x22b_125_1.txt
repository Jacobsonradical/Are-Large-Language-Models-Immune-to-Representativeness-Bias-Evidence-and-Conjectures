To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that deck A was chosen, and B as the event that deck B was chosen. We are given that the prior probability of choosing either deck is equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

We are also given the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
- P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
- P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since P(A|E) + P(B|E) = 1, we can find P(E) as follows:
P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)

Finally, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
O(A:B) = P(A|E) / P(B|E)

Let's calculate these probabilities:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
P(E) = (8/81) * 0.5 + (2/81) * 0.5 = 5/81

Now we can find the posterior probabilities:
P(A|E) = (8/81) * 0.5 / (5/81) = 8/10
P(B|E) = (2/81) * 0.5 / (5/81) = 2/10

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
O(A:B) = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4

So the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.
