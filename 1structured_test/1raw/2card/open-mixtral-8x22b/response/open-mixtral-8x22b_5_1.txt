To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (the prior probability of choosing either deck is equal since it is chosen by chance)
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X card from deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O card from deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X card from deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O card from deck B)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A is given by the binomial coefficient:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(D|A) = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3)
P(D|A) = 32/81

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B is given by:

P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
P(D|B) = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
P(D|B) = 8/81

Now, we can compute the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)
Posterior odds = [P(A) * P(D|A)] / [P(B) * P(D|B)]
Posterior odds = [0.5 * (32/81)] / [0.5 * (8/81)]
Posterior odds = (32/81) / (8/81)
Posterior odds = 32/8
Posterior odds = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
