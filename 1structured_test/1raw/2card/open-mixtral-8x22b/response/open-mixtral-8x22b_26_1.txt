To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can also use a more intuitive approach by comparing the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B:
Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
