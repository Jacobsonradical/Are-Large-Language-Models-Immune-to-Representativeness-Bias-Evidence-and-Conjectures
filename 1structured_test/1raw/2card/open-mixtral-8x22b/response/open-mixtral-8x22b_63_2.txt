To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since the deck was chosen by chance.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is given by:

P(3X, 1O | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)

P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Note that the denominator in both expressions is the same, so we can write:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 * 1/1 = 4

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
