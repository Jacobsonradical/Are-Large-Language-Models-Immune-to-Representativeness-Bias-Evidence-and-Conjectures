{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Given the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. First, let's denote the two hypotheses as A (the cards were drawn from Deck A) and B (the cards were drawn from Deck B).

P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since one of the decks was selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)
               = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
               = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5)
               = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card, are 8:1 compared to Deck B.
