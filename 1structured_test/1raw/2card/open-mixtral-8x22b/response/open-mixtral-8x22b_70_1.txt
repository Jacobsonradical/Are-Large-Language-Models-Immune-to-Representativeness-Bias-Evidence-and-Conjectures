To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the deck is A as E_A and the event that the deck is B as E_B. Let's denote the observation of 3 X's and 1 O as O.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of observing O given that the deck is A (P(O|E_A)) and the likelihood of observing O given that the deck is B (P(O|E_B)).

Since the probability of drawing an X from deck A is 2/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 1/3, the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from deck A is:

P(O|E_A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

Similarly, since the probability of drawing an X from deck B is 1/3, and the probability of drawing an O is 2/3, the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from deck B is:

P(O|E_B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, let's assume that the prior odds of the deck being A or B are 1:1, i.e., the decks are equally likely to be chosen. Then, the posterior odds of the deck being A given the observation O are:

Posterior odds = P(O|E_A) / P(O|E_B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4:1 compared to Deck B.
