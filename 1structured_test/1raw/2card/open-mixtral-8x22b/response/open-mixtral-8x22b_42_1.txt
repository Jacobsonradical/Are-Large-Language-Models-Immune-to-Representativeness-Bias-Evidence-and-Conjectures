To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that Deck A was selected and B as the event that Deck B was selected. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, as the decks are chosen by chance.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B | 3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B) / P(3X, 1O)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can simplify the expression for the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Plugging in the values we calculated earlier:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]

Simplifying the expression:

Posterior odds = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3
Posterior odds = (2^3 / 3^3) / (1^3 / 3^3)
Posterior odds = 2^3 / 1^3
Posterior odds = 8 / 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are $8:1$ .
