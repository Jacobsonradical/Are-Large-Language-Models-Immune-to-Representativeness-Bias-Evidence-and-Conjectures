{odds: 16}

Here's the reasoning:

First, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A, the probability would be:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B, the probability would be:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, since both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially, the prior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B are 1:1.

Next, we'll calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed outcome (3 X and 1 O) from both decks, which is:
(8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Multiplying the prior odds (1:1) by the likelihood ratio (4), we get the posterior odds of 4:1, which can also be expressed as a single number, 16 (since 4/1 = 16).

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 16.
