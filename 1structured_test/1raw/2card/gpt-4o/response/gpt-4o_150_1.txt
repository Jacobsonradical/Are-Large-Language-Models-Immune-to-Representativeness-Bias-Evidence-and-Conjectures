Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

1. **Define Events and Probabilities:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that Deck A was chosen.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that Deck B was chosen.
   - Let \( D \) be the event that 3 cards are X and 1 card is O.

   Given:
   - \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \)  (equal chance of picking Deck A or Deck B)
   - In Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - In Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

2. **Compute the Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is computed using the binomial distribution:
     \[
     P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1
     \]
     \[
     P(D | A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is similarly computed:
     \[
     P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1
     \]
     \[
     P(D | B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Compute the Posterior Odds using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - The posterior odds are given by:
     \[
     \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)}
     \]
   - Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\{odds: 4\}
