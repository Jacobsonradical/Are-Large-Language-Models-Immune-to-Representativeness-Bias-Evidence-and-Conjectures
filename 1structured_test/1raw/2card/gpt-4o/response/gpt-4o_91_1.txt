To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \( P(E|A) \) as the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(E|B) \) as the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B.

Since either deck is selected at random, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the likelihoods:
For Deck A:
\[ P(X) = \frac{2}{3}, \quad P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \]
So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck A is:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(X) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \]
So, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32/2}{8/2} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
