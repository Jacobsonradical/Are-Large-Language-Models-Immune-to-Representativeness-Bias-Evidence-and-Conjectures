To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We'll need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use these to find the posterior odds.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the prior probability of selecting deck \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) be the prior probability of selecting deck \( B \).
- \( P(E|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck \( A \).
- \( P(E|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck \( B \).

Assuming no preference for either deck, the priors are:
\[
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 
\]

Now, compute \( P(E|A) \):
- Probability of drawing an X from deck \( A \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O from deck \( A \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The combination of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by:
\[
P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1
\]

Calculating this:
\[
P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

Next, compute \( P(E|B) \):
- Probability of drawing an X from deck \( B \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O from deck \( B \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

\[
P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1
\]

Calculating this:
\[
P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability ratio:
\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
