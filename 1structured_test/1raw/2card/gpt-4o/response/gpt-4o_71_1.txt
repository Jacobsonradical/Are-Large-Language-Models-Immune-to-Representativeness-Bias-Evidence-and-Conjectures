To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. We need to compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck, then compare these likelihoods given the prior probabilities of selecting either deck.

First, let's denote the following:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of selecting Deck A = \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( P(B) \): Prior probability of selecting Deck B = \( \frac{1}{2} \)

Next, we will calculate the likelihood probabilities:
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A (\( L_A \)):
  \[
  L_A = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- Likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B (\( L_B \)):
  \[
  L_B = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

The posterior odds are given by:
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(\text{Deck A} \mid \text{data})}{P(\text{Deck B} \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid \text{Deck A}) \cdot P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{data} \mid \text{Deck B}) \cdot P(\text{Deck B})}
\]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), the odds simplify to the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{L_A}{L_B} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
