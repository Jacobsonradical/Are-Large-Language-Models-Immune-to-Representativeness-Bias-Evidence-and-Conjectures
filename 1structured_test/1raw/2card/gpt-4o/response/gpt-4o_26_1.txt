To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' Theorem and the likelihood ratio.

First, let's define the events:
- \( H_A \): The event that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \): The event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the deck.

We know:
- \( P(H_A) = 0.5 \) (since the deck was selected by chance)
- \( P(H_B) = 0.5 \)

We need to calculate \( P(E|H_A) \) and \( P(E|H_B) \).

**For Deck A:**
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{1}{3}\)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, considering the order is not important:

\[ P(E|H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ P(E|H_A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]

\[ P(E|H_A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**For Deck B:**
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{2}{3}\)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, considering the order is not important:

\[ P(E|H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ P(E|H_B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]

\[ P(E|H_B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(H_A|E)}{P(H_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|H_A)P(H_A)}{P(E|H_B)P(H_B)} \]

Since \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \):

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|H_A)}{P(E|H_B)} \]

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
