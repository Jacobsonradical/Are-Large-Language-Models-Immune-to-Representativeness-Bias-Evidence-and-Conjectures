To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability. We are given a specific drawing result and want to find the odds that the deck used was Deck A compared to Deck B. 

Given:
- Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O)
- Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O)
- Observation: 4 cards drawn with 3 X and 1 O

First, we calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B.

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:**

   The probability for one specific order (3 X, 1 O) is:
   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O}|A) = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1
   \]
   However, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) different ways to draw 3 X and 1 O. So, the total probability:

   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O}|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:**

   The probability for one specific order (3 X, 1 O) is:
   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O}|B) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1
   \]
   Again, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) different ways to draw 3 X and 1 O. So, the total probability:

   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O}|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the odds:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(\text{Data}|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Data}|B) \cdot P(B)}
\]

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting either deck:

\[
P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Then:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
