To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Probability of selecting Deck A, P(A) = 1/2.
   - Probability of selecting Deck B, P(B) = 1/2.

2. **Calculate the likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
     - Deck A has 2/3 X and 1/3 O.
     - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
       \[
       P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
       \]

   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
     - Deck B has 1/3 X and 2/3 O.
     - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
       \[
       P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
       \]

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   - We need the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} \):
   \[
   \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]

   Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \):

   \[
   \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
