To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote the following events:
- \( A \): the event that the selected deck is Deck A
- \( B \): the event that the selected deck is Deck B
- \( D \): the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We need to compute the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B | D) = \frac{P(D | B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

So the posterior odds can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D | B) P(B)} \]

Assume the prior odds are equal, meaning \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \):

For Deck A (where the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \)):
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (where the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \)):
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, compute the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
