To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' Theorem and the likelihoods of drawing the observed cards from each deck.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck selection is by chance and we are not given specific priors, we can assume equal probability for selecting each deck.
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**

Given:
- Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (deck with mostly X's) is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (deck with mostly O's) is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. **Posterior Odds:**

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are calculated by the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
