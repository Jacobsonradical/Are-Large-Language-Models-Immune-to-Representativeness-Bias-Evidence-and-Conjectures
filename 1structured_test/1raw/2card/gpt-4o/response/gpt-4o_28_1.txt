To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- P(A) = Probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5
- P(B) = Probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5

We need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck. 

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card,
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card,
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

To find the posterior odds (Odds of Deck A given the four cards drawn versus Deck B):
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data} | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since P(A) = P(B) = 0.5,
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot 0.5}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \]

Now, substituting the values we calculated:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
