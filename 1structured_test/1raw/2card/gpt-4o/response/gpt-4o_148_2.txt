To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \( P(E|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- \( P(E|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card regardless of the deck.

By the principle of indifference (since there's no evidence to favor one deck over the other initially), \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we need to find:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{P(E | A) P(A)}{P(E)} \bigg/ \frac{P(E | B) P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E | A)}{P(E | B)}
\]

Considering each deck in turn:
1. For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
   \[
   P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
   \[
   P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

The posterior odds are then:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E | A)}{P(E | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds are:

\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
