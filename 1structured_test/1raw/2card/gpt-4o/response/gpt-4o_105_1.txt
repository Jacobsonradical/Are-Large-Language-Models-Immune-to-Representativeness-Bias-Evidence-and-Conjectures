To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- In Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- In Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

We drew 3 X's and 1 O. 

Using the binomial distribution, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck is calculated as follows:

For Deck A:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

If we assume both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

The posterior odds are the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A \mid 3X, 1O)}{P(B \mid 3X, 1O)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A \mid 3X, 1O) = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O)} \]
\[ P(B \mid 3X, 1O) = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid B) P(B)}{P(3X, 1O)} \]

To form the ratio, the nuisance terms \( P(3X, 1O) \) cancel out:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[ {odds: 4} \]
