To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step outline of the calculation:

1. **Define Hypotheses**:
   - \(H_A\): The deck chosen is Deck A.
   - \(H_B\): The deck chosen is Deck B.

2. **Define Likelihoods**:
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Assume the priors are equal: \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \).

4. **Posterior Probabilities**:
   - We want the odds ratio:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(H_A | \text{data})}{P(H_B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(\text{data} | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)}
     \]
   - Using the likelihoods and priors calculated:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
