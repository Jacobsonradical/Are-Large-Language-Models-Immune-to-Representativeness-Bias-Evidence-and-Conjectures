To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem and calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( H_A \): The cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \): The cards are drawn from Deck B.
  
The prior probability of choosing either deck is equal, so:
\[ P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \]

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is calculated using the binomial distribution. In Deck A, the probability \( p_A \) of drawing an X card is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O card is \( \frac{1}{3} \). The likelihood \( P(E|H_A) \) is:
\[ P(E|H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|H_A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is calculated similarly. In Deck B, the probability \( p_B \) of drawing an X card is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O card is \( \frac{2}{3} \). The likelihood \( P(E|H_B) \) is:
\[ P(E|H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|H_B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_A | E) = \frac{P(E | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_B | E) = \frac{P(E | H_B) P(H_B)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing the odds, we just need to find the ratio of these probabilities:
\[ \text{Odds of Deck A compared to Deck B} = \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(E | H_B) P(H_B)} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
