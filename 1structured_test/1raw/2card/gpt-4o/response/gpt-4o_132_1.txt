To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is chosen at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

2. Let \( P(E|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(E|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

3. Using the binomial distribution, compute \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X (success) = \(\frac{2}{3}\) and O (failure) = \(\frac{1}{3}\),
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = \({{4}\choose{3}} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}\).

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X (success) = \(\frac{1}{3}\) and O (failure) = \(\frac{2}{3}\),
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = \({{4}\choose{3}} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}\).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \].

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.

{odds: 4}
