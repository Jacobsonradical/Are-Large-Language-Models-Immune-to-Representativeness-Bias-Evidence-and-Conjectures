To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O, we use Bayes' theorem.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step solution:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\) (since either deck is equally likely to be chosen initially).


2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]


3. **Posterior Odds:**
   - The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods multiplied by the prior odds:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} / \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
