To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihoods.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event of drawing 4 cards of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We are interested in the ratio of the posterior probabilities \(\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}\). By Bayes' theorem, this can be written as:

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} \]

Since Deck A and Deck B are equally likely to be chosen initially, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the ratio simplifies to:

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, let's compute \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):

For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O):
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial coefficient multiplied by the probabilities:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O):
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is similarly given by:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds are then:

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
