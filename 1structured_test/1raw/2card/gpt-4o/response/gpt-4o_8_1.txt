To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's denote the following events:
- \( D_A \) : The deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( D_B \) : The deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( E \) : The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

We need to calculate \( \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} \), which is the posterior odds of Deck A given the event \( E \). According to Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[
\frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E|D_B) \cdot P(D_B)}
\]

Assuming the prior odds \( \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} \) are equal (i.e., both decks are equally likely to be selected initially), we have \( \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} = 1 \). Therefore, the posterior odds become:

\[
\frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)}
\]

Next, we need to compute \( P(E|D_A) \) and \( P(E|D_B) \):

1. **For Deck A**:
   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
   \[
   P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} ( \frac{2}{3} )^3 ( \frac{1}{3} )^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. **For Deck B**:
   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
   \[
   P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} ( \frac{1}{3} )^3 ( \frac{2}{3} )^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

Finally, we compute the ratio of these probabilities:

\[
\frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
