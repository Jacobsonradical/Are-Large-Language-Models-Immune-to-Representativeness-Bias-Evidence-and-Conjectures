To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and apply it to the given information.

Let:
- \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \(P(E|A)\) and \(P(E|B)\) be the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \(P(E)\) be the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.
- \(O(A:B)\) be the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B given the evidence.

Assume \(P(A) = P(B) = 1/2\) (since the selection of the deck is by chance).

We need to find the likelihoods:
- \(P(E|A)\) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \(P(E|B)\) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

**Calculation for Deck A:**
In Deck A, the probability of drawing X is \(2/3\) and the probability of drawing O is \(1/3\). The likelihood \(P(E|A)\) is calculated as a combination of drawing 3 X's out of 4 cards, with 1 O:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}. \]

**Calculation for Deck B:**
In Deck B, the probability of drawing X is \(1/3\) and the probability of drawing O is \(2/3\). The likelihood \(P(E|B)\) is calculated similarly:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}. \]

**Finding the posterior odds:**
The posterior odds \(O(A:B)\) is given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities, which simplifies to the ratio of the likelihoods since the prior probabilities are equal:
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)}. \]

Thus,
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
