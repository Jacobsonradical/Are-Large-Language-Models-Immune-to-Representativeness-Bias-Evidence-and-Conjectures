To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem and compute the likelihoods for both decks.

Let's define:
- \( H_A \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( D \): The data that 4 cards have been drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(H_A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( P(H_B) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- In Deck A, \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- In Deck B, \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

We need to calculate \( P(D | H_A) \) and \( P(D | H_B) \), the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

### Likelihood for Deck A:
\[ P(D | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D | H_A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Likelihood for Deck B:
\[ P(D | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D | H_B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds:
The odds in favor of \( H_A \) compared to \( H_B \) given the data can be calculated using the likelihood ratio:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(H_A | D)}{P(H_B | D)} = \frac{P(D | H_A)}{P(D | H_B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4}
