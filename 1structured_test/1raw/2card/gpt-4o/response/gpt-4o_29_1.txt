To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

1. First, let's define some terms:
   - \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A, which is 1/2.
   - \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B, which is also 1/2.
   - \( P(E | A) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O from Deck A.
   - \( P(E | B) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O from Deck B.
   - \( E \) represents the event of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O.

2. Calculate \( P(E | A) \):
   - In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   - The combinations for drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order (total of 4 cards) can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:

     \[
     P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

3. Calculate \( P(E | B) \):
   - In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - The combinations for drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated similarly:

     \[
     P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

4. Calculate the posterior odds (ratio of posterior probabilities):
   - According to Bayes' theorem, we need the ratio \( \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} \):

     \[
     \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{P(E | A) P(A)}{P(E | B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{2}{8} = 4
     \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
