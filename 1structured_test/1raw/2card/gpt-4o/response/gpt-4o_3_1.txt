To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem and calculate the likelihoods for both scenarios.

Given:
- In Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards are X and \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards are O.
- In Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards are X and \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards are O.

We want to find the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(\text{Deck A} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})}{P(\text{Deck B} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})} \]
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ \frac{P(\text{Deck A} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})}{P(\text{Deck B} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})} = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} \mid \text{Deck A}) \cdot P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} \mid \text{Deck B}) \cdot P(\text{Deck B})} \]

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially:
\[ P(\text{Deck A}) = P(\text{Deck B}) = 0.5 \]

The likelihoods are:
\[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O} \mid \text{Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O} \mid \text{Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

So the odds are calculated as:
\[ \frac{P(\text{Deck A} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})}{P(\text{Deck B} \mid \text{3 X, 1 O})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
