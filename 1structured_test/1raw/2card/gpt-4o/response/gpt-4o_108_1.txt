To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the data (drawing 3 X's and 1 O).

We are interested in finding the posterior odds \(\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}\).

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{1}{3}\)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (using binomial distribution) is:
\[
P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27 \times 3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{2}{3}\)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[
P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27 \times 3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, i.e., \(P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\), by Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:

\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
