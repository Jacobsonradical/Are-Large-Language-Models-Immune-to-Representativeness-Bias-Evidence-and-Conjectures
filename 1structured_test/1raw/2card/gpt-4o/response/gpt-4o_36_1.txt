To determine the posterior odds, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then compare these probabilities.

First, let's assign some variables:
- \(A\) denotes the event of selecting Deck A
- \(B\) denotes the event of selecting Deck B
- \(D\) denotes the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We need to calculate the following probabilities:
- \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\): the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
  Since the selection is by chance, we assume these to be equal: \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\).

- \(P(D | A)\): the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck A was chosen.
- \(P(D | B)\): the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck B was chosen.

- The posterior odds are given by the ratio: \( \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)}\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B | D) = \frac{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Thus:
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), they cancel out:
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} \]

Next, we need \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \):

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X card: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card (in any order) from Deck A:
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X card: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card (in any order) from Deck B:
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we find the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
