To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( H_A \) as the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \) as the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( D \) as the observed data, which is 3 X cards and 1 O card.

First, we need to calculate the likelihoods of the observed data under both hypotheses:
- The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
- The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.

The prior probabilities for selecting either deck are equal since one of them has been chosen by chance:
\[ P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \]

The likelihoods are given by the binomial distribution:
\[
P(D|H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

\[
P(D|H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Bayes' theorem gives us the posterior probabilities:
\[
P(H_A | D) = \frac{P(D | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(H_B | D) = \frac{P(D | H_B) P(H_B)}{P(D)}
\]

The posterior odds are the ratio of these posterior probabilities:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(H_A | D)}{P(H_B | D)} = \frac{P(D | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(D | H_B) P(H_B)}
= \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\{odds: 4\}
