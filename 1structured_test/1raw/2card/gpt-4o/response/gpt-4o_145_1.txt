To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The event that the selected deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We're looking to compute the posterior odds, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} \]

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B | D) = \frac{P(D | B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

So the posterior odds become:
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D | B) P(B)} \]

Let's assume that either deck is equally likely to be selected initially, so:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we need to determine \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \).

### Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

Calculating this:
\[ P(D | A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

Calculating this:
\[ P(D | B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Computing the Posterior Odds
Now we can plug in these probabilities into our posterior odds formula:

\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D | B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{81}{8} \times 2 = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
