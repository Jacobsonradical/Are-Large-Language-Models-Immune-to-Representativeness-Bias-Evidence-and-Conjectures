To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem and the information provided about the decks and the draw.

First, let's define the following events:
- \(A\): The event that the deck selected is Deck A.
- \(B\): The event that the deck selected is Deck B.
- \(D\): The event that 4 cards drawn result in 3 X's and 1 O.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
\]
and
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

We are looking for the posterior odds, which is given by:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}
\]

Since the selection of the deck is by chance and assumes the prior probabilities:
\[
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5
\]

So the odds formula simplifies to:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)}
\]

Next, we need to calculate \(P(D|A)\) and \(P(D|B)\).

For Deck A, the probability \(P(D|A)\) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (from a deck where \(2/3\) of the cards are X and \(1/3\) are O) is given by:
\[
P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B, the probability \(P(D|B)\) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (from a deck where \(1/3\) of the cards are X and \(2/3\) are O) is given by:
\[
P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds are given by:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 drawn cards were from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
{odds: 4}
\]
