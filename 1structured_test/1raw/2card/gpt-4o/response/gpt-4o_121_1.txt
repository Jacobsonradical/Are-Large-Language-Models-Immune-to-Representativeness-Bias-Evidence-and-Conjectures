To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' Theorem and the concept of likelihoods.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The event that the deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( B \): The event that the deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event that 3 of the 4 drawn cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We are looking for the odds ratio:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is common in both the numerator and denominator when calculating the odds, it cancels out, so:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} \]

Assume the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) for choosing decks are equal, so:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus, we have:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Next, determine \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \). 

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X ( \( P(X|A) \) ) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O ( \( P(O|A) \) ) = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

Using the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X ( \( P(X|B) \) ) = \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O ( \( P(O|B) \) ) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Similarly:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus, the odds are:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
