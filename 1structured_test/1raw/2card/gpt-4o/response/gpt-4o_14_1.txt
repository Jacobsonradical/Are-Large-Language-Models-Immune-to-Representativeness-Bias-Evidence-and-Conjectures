To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds. Let's define the following:

- \( P(D_A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(D_B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.

Since the deck was selected by chance, \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5 \).

We need the likelihoods:
- \( P(XXXO | D_A) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(XXXO | D_B) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability for drawing any combination of 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial distribution formula:
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability for drawing any combination of 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | D_B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D_A | XXXO)}{P(D_B | XXXO)} = \frac{P(XXXO | D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(XXXO | D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
