To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the principles of conditional probability.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A. Since it's chosen by chance, \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B. Similarly, \( P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(X|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( P(X) \) as the overall probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, which can be computed using the law of total probability.

We need to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(A|X) \) and \( P(B|X) \), and then find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} \).

Step 1: Calculate \( P(X|A) \) and \( P(X|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(X|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \]
\[ P(X|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(X|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(X|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(X|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \]
\[ P(X|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(X|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(X|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Step 2: Calculate \( P(X) \) using the law of total probability.

\[ P(X) = P(X|A) P(A) + P(X|B) P(B) \]
\[ P(X) = \left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \]
\[ P(X) = \frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162} \]
\[ P(X) = \frac{40}{162} \]
\[ P(X) = \frac{20}{81} \]

Step 3: Calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(A|X) \) and \( P(B|X) \).

\[ P(A|X) = \frac{P(X|A) P(A)}{P(X)} \]
\[ P(A|X) = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{20}{81}\right)} \]
\[ P(A|X) = \frac{32}{40} \]
\[ P(A|X) = \frac{4}{5} \]

\[ P(B|X) = \frac{P(X|B) P(B)}{P(X)} \]
\[ P(B|X) = \frac{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{20}{81}\right)} \]
\[ P(B|X) = \frac{8}{40} \]
\[ P(B|X) = \frac{1}{5} \]

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} \).

\[ \text{posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds are 4.
