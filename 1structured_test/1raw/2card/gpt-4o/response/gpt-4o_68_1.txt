To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( D \) be the data that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing this combination from each deck.
1. For Deck A: 
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O when the composition is 2/3 X and 1/3 O:
   \[
   P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. For Deck B:
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O when the composition is 1/3 X and 2/3 O:
   \[
   P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

We assume the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probabilities:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

Since the prior probabilities are equal, the posterior odds are just the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
