We will use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem in terms of odds can be written as:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio}
\]

**Prior Odds:** 

Since each deck is equally likely to be chosen, the prior odds of choosing Deck A over Deck B are 1:1.

**Likelihood Ratio:**

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck A to the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck B.

Let's calculate these probabilities.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (order does not matter):

\[
\binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (order does not matter):

\[
\binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

The likelihood ratio is:

\[
\frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = 1 \times 4 = 4
\]

In our desired format:

\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
