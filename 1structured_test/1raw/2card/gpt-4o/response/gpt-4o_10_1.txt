To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior odds.

Let's define the events:
- \( D_A \): Cards are drawn from Deck A
- \( D_B \): Cards are drawn from Deck B
- \( E \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O out of 4 draws.

We need to calculate the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(D_A|E) = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(D_B|E) = \frac{P(E|D_B) \cdot P(D_B)}{P(E)} \]

First, assume the prior probabilities:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the likelihoods \( P(E|D_A) \) and \( P(E|D_B) \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we substitute these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(D_A|E) = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{P(E)} = \frac{16}{81} \]
\[ P(D_B|E) = \frac{P(E|D_B) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{P(E)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{P(E)} = \frac{4}{81} \]

The posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{\frac{16}{81}}{\frac{4}{81}} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
