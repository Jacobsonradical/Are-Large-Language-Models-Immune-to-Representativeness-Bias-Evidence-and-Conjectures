To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. Let's denote the two hypotheses as:
- Hypothesis A (H_A): The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- Hypothesis B (H_B): The cards were drawn from Deck B.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B. Since the deck is chosen by chance, we assume these probabilities are equal, i.e., P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5.

Next, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given each hypothesis.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X (X_A) = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O (O_A) = 1/3

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot (X_A)^3 \cdot (O_A)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X (X_B) = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O (O_B) = 2/3

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot (X_B)^3 \cdot (O_B)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(H_A | 3X \text{ and } 1O)}{P(H_B | 3X \text{ and } 1O)} \):

First, compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_A | 3X \text{ and } 1O) \propto P(3X \text{ and } 1O | H_A) \cdot P(H_A) \]
\[ \propto \frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ \propto \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(H_B | 3X \text{ and } 1O) \propto P(3X \text{ and } 1O | H_B) \cdot P(H_B) \]
\[ \propto \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ \propto \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds are then:
\[ \frac{P(H_A | 3X \text{ and } 1O)}{P(H_B | 3X \text{ and } 1O)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are {odds: 4}.
