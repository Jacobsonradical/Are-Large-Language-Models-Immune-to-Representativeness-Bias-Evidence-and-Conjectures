To calculate the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and combine this with the prior probabilities for selecting each deck.

Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(E|A) \): The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(E|B) \): The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since the deck was selected by chance, each deck has equal prior probability, so:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

The likelihoods \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \) can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.

For Deck A: \(( \frac{2}{3} X, \frac{1}{3} O ) \)
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B: \(( \frac{1}{3} X, \frac{2}{3} O ) \)
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, use Bayes' theorem to find:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
