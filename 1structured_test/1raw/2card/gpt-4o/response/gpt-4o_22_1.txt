To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem and calculate the posterior odds of having drawn 4 cards from Deck A versus Deck B given that we drew 3 X's and 1 O.

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) represent the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( X \) represent drawing a card marked X.
- \( O \) represent drawing a card marked O.

We are interested in the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \), where \( D \) represents the data of having drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since the decks are chosen at random, we have:

\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the formula simplifies to:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A**:
In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X, and 1/3 are O. Therefore:
\[ P(D|A) = P(\text{3 X's and 1 O from Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B**:
In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X, and 2/3 are O. Therefore:
\[ P(D|B) = P(\text{3 X's and 1 O from Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Finally, we take the ratio of these probabilities:
\[ \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
