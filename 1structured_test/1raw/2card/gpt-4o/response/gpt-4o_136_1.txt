To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O), we need to use Bayes' theorem and the likelihood ratio.

First, let's denote:
- \(P(A)\) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen randomly).
- \(P(B)\) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks:
- For Deck A, where the probability of drawing an X is \(P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3}\) and the probability of drawing an O is \(P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3}\).
- For Deck B, where the probability of drawing an X is \(P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3}\) and the probability of drawing an O is \(P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3}\).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, \(P(3X, 1O | A)\), is given by:
\[
P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, \(P(3X, 1O | B)\), is given by:
\[
P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Next, we calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we look at the ratio of the posterior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B, which is equal to the ratio of the prior probabilities times the ratio of the likelihoods:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
