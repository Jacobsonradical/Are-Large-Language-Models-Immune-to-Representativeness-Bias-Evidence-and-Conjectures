To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): The event that Deck A was selected.
- \( B \): The event that Deck B was selected.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the deck is selected by chance and there are two decks).

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods:
- The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A, where \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B, where \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \):
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem, we need the posterior probability, but here we will directly look for the posterior odds ratio:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)} = \frac{P(3X,1O|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X,1O|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4 to 1.
