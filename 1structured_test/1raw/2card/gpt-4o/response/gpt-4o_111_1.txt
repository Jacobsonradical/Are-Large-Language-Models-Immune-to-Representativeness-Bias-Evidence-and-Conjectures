To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( D_A \): The event that Deck A was selected.
   - \( D_B \): The event that Deck B was selected.
   - \( E \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   Since the deck is chosen by chance, the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are both 0.5.
   - \( P(D_A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(D_B) = 0.5 \)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - For Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws is calculated using the binomial distribution.
     \[
     P(E | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - For Deck B: Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws is:
     \[
     P(E | D_B) = \binom{4}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

4. **Posterior Odds:**
   The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities \( P(D_A | E) / P(D_B | E) \).

   By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B) \cdot P(D_B)}
   \]

   Substituting the respective values:
   \[
   \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
