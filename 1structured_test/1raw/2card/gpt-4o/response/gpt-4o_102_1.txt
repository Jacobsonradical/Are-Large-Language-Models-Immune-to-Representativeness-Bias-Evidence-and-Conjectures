To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards drawn were from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we will use Bayes' Theorem and the odds form of the theorem.

First, let's denote our events:
- \(D_A\): The deck selected is A.
- \(D_B\): The deck selected is B.
- \(E\): 4 cards drawn, 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We need the probabilities:
- \(P(D_A)\) and \(P(D_B)\), which are equal and given by chance selection, so \(P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2}\).
- \(P(E|D_A)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \(P(E|D_B)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Using the probabilities of drawing cards from each deck, we calculate \(P(E|D_A)\) and \(P(E|D_B)\) using combinations.

For Deck A (\(X\) = 2/3, \(O\) = 1/3):
\[ P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (\(X\) = 1/3, \(O\) = 2/3):
\[ P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem in terms of odds:
\[ \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E|D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \times \frac{1}{2}}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.

Hence, the final answer is:
{odds: 4}
