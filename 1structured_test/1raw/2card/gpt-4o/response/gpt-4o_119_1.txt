To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \(A\) as the event that we selected Deck A.
- \(B\) as the event that we selected Deck B.
- \(E\) as the event that we drew 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to calculate \(P(A|E) / P(B|E)\). Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

So the posterior odds are:

\[
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E|B) P(B)}
\]

We need the prior probabilities \(P(A) = P(B) = 1/2\) (since the deck was selected by chance), and we need to calculate \(P(E|A)\) and \(P(E|B)\).

Given that 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (using the multinomial distribution) is:

\[
P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

Given that 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (using the multinomial distribution) is:

\[
P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now substituting back into our posterior odds formula:

\[
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32/81 \cdot 1/2}{8/81 \cdot 1/2} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds are:
\[
{odds: 4}
\]
