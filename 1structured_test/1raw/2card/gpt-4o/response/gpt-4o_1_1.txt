To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the selected deck is Deck B.

First, calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

### Deck A
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

\[ P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

Calculate this:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27} \]
\[ \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = \frac{1}{3} \]

So the probability is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Deck B
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

\[ P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

Calculate this:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27} \]
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = \frac{2}{3} \]

So the probability is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Prior Probabilities
The decks are chosen at random, so \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

### Posterior Odds
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B given the observed data \( D \) (3 X's and 1 O) is:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} \times 1 = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
