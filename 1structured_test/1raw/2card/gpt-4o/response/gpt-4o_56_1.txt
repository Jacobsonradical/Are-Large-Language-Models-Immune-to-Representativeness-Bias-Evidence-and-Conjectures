To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayes' Theorem and the given information.

We need the following probabilities:
1. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, denoted \( P(E|A) \)
2. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, denoted \( P(E|B) \)
3. The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, which are both \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

First, we calculate \( P(E|A) \):
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A = \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The order of drawing doesn't matter, so we use combinations. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose which of the 4 cards is an O.

\[ P(E|A) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E|B) \):
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Similarly, the number of ways of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is still 4.

\[ P(E|B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E|A) P(A) + P(E|B) P(B)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E|A) P(A) + P(E|B) P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) we can simplify to:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|A) + P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{40}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)}{P(E|A) + P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81}}{\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}} = \frac{\frac{8}{81}}{\frac{40}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Finally, we find the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds (A:B)} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{1} = 4 \]

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
