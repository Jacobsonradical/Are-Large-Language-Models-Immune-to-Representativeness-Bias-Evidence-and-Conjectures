To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem along with the likelihood ratio.

Given:
- Deck A: P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- Deck B: P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3

We want to find:
- The probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (denoted as P(A|data))
- The probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B (denoted as P(B|data))

The data provided is that 4 cards are drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|data) = \frac{P(data|A)P(A)}{P(data)} \]
\[ P(B|data) = \frac{P(data|B)P(B)}{P(data)} \]

Since the decks are equally likely to be chosen a priori:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 \]

We need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(data|A) \) and \( P(data|B) \):
\[ P(data|A) = \text{Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A} \]
\[ P(data|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(data|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(data|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(data|B) = \text{Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B} \]
\[ P(data|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(data|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(data|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we compute the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|data)}{P(B|data)} = \frac{P(data|A) P(A)}{P(data|B) P(B)} \]
Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(data|A)}{P(data|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
