To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( X \) as the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card in 4 draws.

We need to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|X) = \frac{P(X|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X)} \]
\[ P(B|X) = \frac{P(X|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(X)} \]

Thus, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} = \frac{P(X|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Next, we need to calculate each component:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are equal since the decks are chosen by chance, hence \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X|A) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
  - In Deck A, the probability of drawing X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
  - This can be computed using the binomial coefficient:
    \[ P(X|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]
- \( P(X|B) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
  - In Deck B, the probability of drawing X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
  - This can be computed similarly:
    \[ P(X|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|X)}{P(B|X)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (compared to Deck B) are:
{odds: 4}
