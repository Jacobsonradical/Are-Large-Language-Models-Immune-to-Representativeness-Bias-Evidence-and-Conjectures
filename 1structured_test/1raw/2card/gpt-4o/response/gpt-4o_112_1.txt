To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the likelihood ratio.

First, let's denote the following:
- \( P(A) \) = Prior probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5
- \( P(B) \) = Prior probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5

The likelihood \( P(3X \text{ and } 1O | A) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O.

\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) =  \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood \( P(3X \text{ and } 1O | B) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B. In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O.

\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) =  \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by the ratio of these likelihoods:

\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are:
