To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \): the prior probability of choosing Deck A
- \( P(B) \): the prior probability of choosing Deck B
- \( P(D|A) \): the probability of drawing the 4 cards (3X, 1O) from Deck A
- \( P(D|B) \): the probability of drawing the 4 cards (3X, 1O) from Deck B
- \( P(A|D) \): the posterior probability that the 4 cards are from Deck A given the drawn cards
- \( P(B|D) \): the posterior probability that the 4 cards are from Deck B given the drawn cards

Since the decks are chosen by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

To find \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \), we need to use the binomial distribution formula for drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws.

For Deck A:
\[
P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1
\]
\[
P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)
\]
\[
P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81}
\]
\[
P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B:
\[
P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1
\]
\[
P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)
\]
\[
P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81}
\]
\[
P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now, let's calculate the ratio \( \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \):
\[
\frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \) is the same as the ratio \( \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \).

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[
{odds: 4}
\]
