To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem and the concept of odds. We need to compute the probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where the majority are X) compared to Deck B (where the majority are O).

First, let's denote the events:
- \( A \): The cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \): The cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( D \): The observed draw of cards, which consists of 3 X and 1 O.

We need to calculate the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \), given our prior odds and the likelihood of the observed event (drawing 3 X and 1 O) from both decks.

**Prior Odds:**
We assume decks A and B are equally likely to be chosen initially, thus:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]
Hence, the prior odds \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \).

**Likelihood:**
1. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, where 2/3 cards are X:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, where 1/3 cards are X:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Posterior Odds:**
Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
