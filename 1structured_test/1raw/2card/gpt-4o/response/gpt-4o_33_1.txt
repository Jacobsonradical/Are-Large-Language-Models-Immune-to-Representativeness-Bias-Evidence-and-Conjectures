To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.

We draw 4 cards and observe that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Let:
- A denote the event that Deck A was chosen.
- B denote the event that Deck B was chosen.
- Evidence E be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, calculate the probability of observing the evidence given each deck:

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:**
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(E|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:**
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(E|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, assume that the prior probabilities of selecting each deck initially are equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

By Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) \):
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
