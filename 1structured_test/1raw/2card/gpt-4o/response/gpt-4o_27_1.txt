To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem along with the concept of likelihood ratios. Here we will calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from both decks A and B, and then use these to determine the posterior odds.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Deck A is chosen.
- \( B \): Deck B is chosen.
- \( D \): Drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find the posterior odds \(\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}\).

By Bayes' theorem, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)}
\]

Assuming decks A and B are equally likely to be chosen, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), so they cancel out:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)}
\]

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

### Calculation of \( P(D|A) \)
In Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X card \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from deck A can be computed using the binomial coefficient:

\[
P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

### Calculation of \( P(D|B) \)
In Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X card \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from deck B can also be computed:

\[
P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

### Posterior Odds

\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:
\[
\{ \text{odds: } 4 \}
\]
