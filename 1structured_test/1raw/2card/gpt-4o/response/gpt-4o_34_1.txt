To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem in the context of the situation:

1. **Prior odds**: Since each deck (A or B) has an equal probability of being selected, the prior odds \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \) is 1 (or \( \frac{1}{1} \)).

2. **Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O**:
   - From Deck A: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - From Deck B: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Posterior odds**: Using the likelihood ratios:
   \[
   \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
