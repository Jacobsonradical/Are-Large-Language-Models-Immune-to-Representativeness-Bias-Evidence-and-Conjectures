To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the following:
- \( H_A \) is the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \) is the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to calculate the posterior odds \( \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} \), where \( D \) is the data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Bayes' theorem in terms of odds states:
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = \frac{P(D|H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(D|H_B) \cdot P(H_B)} \]

The prior odds \( \frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_B)} \) are 1 because the selection of Deck A or Deck B is by chance, so each has a prior probability of 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|H_A) \) and \( P(D|H_B) \):

**Likelihood under \( H_A \):**
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is \( \frac{2}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O from Deck A is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|H_A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|H_A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|H_A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|H_A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Likelihood under \( H_B \):**
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O from Deck B is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|H_B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|H_B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|H_B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|H_B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Calculating posterior odds:**
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = \frac{P(D|H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(D|H_B) \cdot P(H_B)} \]
Since \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \), they cancel out:
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = \frac{P(D|H_A)}{P(D|H_B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(H_A|D)}{P(H_B|D)} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
