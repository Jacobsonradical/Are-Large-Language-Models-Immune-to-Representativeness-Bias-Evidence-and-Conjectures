To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds of having chosen Deck A versus Deck B given the observed data. 

First, we define the events:
- \( D_A \): Deck A is chosen
- \( D_B \): Deck B is chosen
- \( E \): The event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn

We need to find \(\frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)}\).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(D_A | E) = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(D_B | E) = \frac{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)}{P(E)} \]

Thus,
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)} \]

Assuming the decks were chosen with equal probability:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

So,
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} \]

We now need to calculate \( P(E | D_A) \) and \( P(E | D_B) \).

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the multinomial probability:

\[ P(E | D_A) = \binom{4}{3, 1} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

Calculating this:
\[ P(E | D_A) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by:

\[ P(E | D_B) = \binom{4}{3, 1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

Calculating this:
\[ P(E | D_B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
