To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood to find the posterior odds.

First, let's define the events:
- \( D_A \): Deck A was chosen.
- \( D_B \): Deck B was chosen.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

We need to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(D_A | E) = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(D_B | E) = \frac{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} \) can be simplified to:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)} \]

Assume the decks were chosen with equal probability, so \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(E | D_A) \) and \( P(E | D_B) \).

For Deck A:
\[ P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, compute the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
