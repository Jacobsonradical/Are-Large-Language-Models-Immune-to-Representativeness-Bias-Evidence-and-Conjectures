To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we'll use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( D_A \): Drawing from Deck A
- \( D_B \): Drawing from Deck B
- \( E \): Drawing 3 X's and 1 O

First, we need to calculate the probabilities \( P(E|D_A) \) and \( P(E|D_B) \):

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (where 2/3 cards are X):**

To draw 3 X's and 1 O from a deck where 2/3 are X and 1/3 are O, we use the binomial distribution formula:

\[
P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (where 1/3 cards are X):**

Similarly, to draw 3 X's and 1 O from a deck where 1/3 are X and 2/3 are O:

\[
P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now, let's calculate the prior probabilities assuming each deck is equally likely to be chosen:

\[
P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5
\]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(D_A|E) \) is calculated as:

\[
P(D_A|E) = \frac{P(E|D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E|D_A) P(D_A) + P(E|D_B) P(D_B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5}{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5 + \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

The posterior probability \( P(D_B|E) \) is:

\[
P(D_B|E) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5 + \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

The posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} \) are:

\[
\frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4
\]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
