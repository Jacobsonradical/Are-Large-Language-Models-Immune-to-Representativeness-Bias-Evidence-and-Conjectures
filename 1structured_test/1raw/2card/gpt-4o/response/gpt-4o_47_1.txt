To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards drawn (with 3 marked X and 1 marked O) were from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood.

First, let’s define the events:
- \( A \): The selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The selected deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): Drawing 4 cards from the selected deck with 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We need to compute the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are then:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) / P(D)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B) / P(D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming the prior probability of selecting each deck is equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \):
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now we calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
