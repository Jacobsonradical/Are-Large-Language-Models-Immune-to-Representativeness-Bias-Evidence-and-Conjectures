To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem in the form of odds.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): The event that we selected Deck A.
- \( B \): The event that we selected Deck B.
- \( E \): The event that we drew 4 cards, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to compute the likelihoods of drawing these cards from each deck.

**Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of event \( E \) given Deck A (\( P(E|A) \)):**

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X card is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O card is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the multinomial probability:
\[
P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3, 1} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)
\]

Calculating it:
\[
P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of event \( E \) given Deck B (\( P(E|B) \)):**

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X card is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O card is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

So, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the multinomial probability:
\[
P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3, 1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)
\]

Calculating it:
\[
P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the prior odds and posterior odds:**

Assume that the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are equal because the deck was chosen at random.
\[
\frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1
\]

Bayes' theorem for odds states that the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:
\[
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \cdot \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = 1 \cdot \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
