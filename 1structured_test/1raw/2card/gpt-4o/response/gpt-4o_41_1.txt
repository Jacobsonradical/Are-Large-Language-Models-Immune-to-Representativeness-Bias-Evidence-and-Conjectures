To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards drawn were from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will follow the process of Bayesian inference.

Let's define:
- \( H_A \) as the hypothesis that the cards are from Deck A.
- \( H_B \) as the hypothesis that the cards are from Deck B.
- \( E \) as the event that 3 out of 4 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We start with equal prior probabilities for selecting either deck:
- \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \).

Next, we need to compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

**Likelihood for Deck A** (where \(2/3\) of the cards are X and \(1/3\) are O):

The probability \( P(E | H_A) \) is computed using the binomial distribution:

\[ P(E | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[
P(E | H_A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

**Likelihood for Deck B** (where \(1/3\) of the cards are X and \(2/3\) are O):

The probability \( P(E | H_B) \) is computed similarly:

\[ P(E | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[
P(E | H_B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now, calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities of the two hypotheses:

\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(E | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)}
\]

Given \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \), they cancel out in the ratio:

\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E | H_A)}{P(E | H_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
