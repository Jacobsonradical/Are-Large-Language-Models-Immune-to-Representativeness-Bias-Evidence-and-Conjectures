To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. The problem essentially asks for the posterior odds of the drawn cards coming from Deck A versus Deck B given the observed draw of 3 X's and 1 O.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Prior Odds (P(A) / P(B))**:
   - Since the deck is chosen by chance, the probability of choosing either deck is the same: \(P(A) = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the prior odds of A to B is: \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

   For Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
   - Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (binomial distribution):
     \[
     P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

   For Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
   - Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (binomial distribution):
     \[
     P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Posterior Odds:**
   - The posterior odds of A to B given the evidence E is given by:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{P(E | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}
     \]
   - Since \(P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E | A)}{P(E | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

### Final Answer:
{odds: 4}
