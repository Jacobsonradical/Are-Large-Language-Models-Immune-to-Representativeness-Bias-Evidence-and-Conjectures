To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let \(A\) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \(B\) be the event that the deck is Deck B. We're interested in the ratio \(\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}\), where \(D\) is the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (event \(D\)) from each deck:
- For Deck A: The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is calculated using the binomial coefficient:
  \[
  P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- For Deck B: The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is calculated similarly:
  \[
  P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Assuming the prior probabilities \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\) are equal (each is \(0.5\)), we compute the posterior odds as follows:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\{odds: 4\}
