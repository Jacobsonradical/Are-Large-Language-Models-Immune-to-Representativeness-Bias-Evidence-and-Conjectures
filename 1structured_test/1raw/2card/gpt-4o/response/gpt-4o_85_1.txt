To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that we drew 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( H_A \) be the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \) be the hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( D \) be the observed data, i.e., drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We need to calculate the posterior odds, which is given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(H_A | D)}{P(H_B | D)} \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_A | D) = \frac{P(D | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H_B | D) = \frac{P(D | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)}{P(D)} \]

The ratios then simplify to:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(D | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)} \]

Assuming no prior preference for either deck, we have:
\[ P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D | H_A)}{P(D | H_B)} \]

Now we need \( P(D | H_A) \) and \( P(D | H_B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O (in any order):
\[ P(D | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D | H_A) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O (in any order):
\[ P(D | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D | H_B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

So the posterior odds are:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D | H_A)}{P(D | H_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \boxed{4} \]
