To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs about which deck the 4 cards were drawn from based on the observed data.

We are given:
- Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

We are also given:
- Prior probability of selecting either deck: \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- The observed data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from the selected deck.

Let's denote:
- Event \( A \): The selected deck is A.
- Event \( B \): The selected deck is B.

We want to find the posterior odds: \( \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} \).

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing the observed data from each deck.

**Likelihood for Deck A**:
\[ P(\text{data} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Likelihood for Deck B**:
\[ P(\text{data} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

We now use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities:
\[
P(A \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{data})}
\]
\[
P(B \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B)}{P(\text{data})}
\]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), we can simplify the posterior odds:
\[
\frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B)} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} =  \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
