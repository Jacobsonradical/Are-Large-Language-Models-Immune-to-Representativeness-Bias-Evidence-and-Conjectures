To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The selected deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event that 4 cards drawn yield 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Given that the priors \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are both equally likely (because the deck was chosen at random), we have:

\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus,

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{P(D|B) \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now we need to compute the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

So, the posterior odds are:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
