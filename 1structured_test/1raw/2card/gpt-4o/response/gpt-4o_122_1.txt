To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood ratios (also known as Bayes factors).

Given: 

- Deck A: P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- Deck B: P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3

We need to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O.

First, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xâ€™s and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X and 1O | Deck A) = \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \)
= 4 * \( \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \) * \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\)
= \( \frac{32}{81} \)

For Deck B:
P(3X and 1O | Deck B) = \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \)
= 4 * \( \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \) * \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\)
= \( \frac{8}{81} \)

Next, we calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds (Deck A : Deck B) = (P(3X and 1O | Deck A) / P(3X and 1O | Deck B)) * (Prior odds Deck A : Deck B)

Assuming equal prior odds, Priors Odds (Deck A : Deck B) = 1.

Therefore,
Posterior odds (Deck A : Deck B) = \(\frac{ \frac{32}{81} }{ \frac{8}{81} } \) * 1 
= \(\frac{32}{8}\) 
= 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
