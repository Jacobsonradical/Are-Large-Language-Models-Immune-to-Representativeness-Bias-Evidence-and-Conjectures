To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's establish some probabilities:

- \( P(X|A) \): Probability of drawing an X from Deck A = 2/3.
- \( P(O|A) \): Probability of drawing an O from Deck A = 1/3.
- \( P(X|B) \): Probability of drawing an X from Deck B = 1/3.
- \( P(O|B) \): Probability of drawing an O from Deck B = 2/3.

Next, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

**Likelihood from Deck A:**
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Likelihood from Deck B:**
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds (A to B)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[ \text{Posterior Odds (A to B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{81} \div \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
