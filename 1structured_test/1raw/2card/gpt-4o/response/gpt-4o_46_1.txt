To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds that the four cards drawn were from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of selecting Deck A
- \( P(B) \): Prior probability of selecting Deck B
- \( P(E|A) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

Since the selection of the deck is at random, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

**Step 1: Calculate \( P(E|A) \)**

In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

\[
P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate \( P(E|B) \)**

In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated similarly:

\[
P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds**

The posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}
\]

\[
= \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

Final answer format:
{odds: 4}
