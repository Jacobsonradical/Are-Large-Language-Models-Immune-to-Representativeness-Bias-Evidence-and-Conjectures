We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, which in this context helps to update the probability of the hypothesis (which deck was selected) given the observed evidence (the drawn cards).

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \(A\) is the event that Deck A was chosen.
- \(B\) is the event that Deck B was chosen.
- \(E\) is the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We need to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds is then:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} \]

Assuming the prior odds are equal, so \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\), the formula simplifies to:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]

Next, we calculate \(P(E|A)\) and \(P(E|B)\). These are the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

1. For Deck A: The probability of drawing X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   \[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. For Deck B: The probability of drawing X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   \[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Then the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
