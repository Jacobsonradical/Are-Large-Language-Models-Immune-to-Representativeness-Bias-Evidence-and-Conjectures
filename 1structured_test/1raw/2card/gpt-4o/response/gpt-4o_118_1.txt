To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (compared to Deck B), we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(X|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(X|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Given that the decks were chosen at random, we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Using the binomial distribution to calculate \( P(X|A) \) and \( P(X|B) \):

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probabilities:
\[
P(A | 3X, 1O) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O)}
\]
\[
P(B | 3X, 1O) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | B) P(B)}{P(3X, 1O)}
\]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O overall \( P(3X, 1O) \):
\[
P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | A)P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B)P(B)
\]

Given both decks are equal prior:
\[
P(3X, 1O) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{32 + 8}{162} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81}
\]

Now, calculating the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(A | 3X, 1O) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{16}{20} = 0.8
\]
\[
P(B | 3X, 1O) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{4}{20} = 0.2
\]

The posterior odds for Deck A versus Deck B is:
\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
