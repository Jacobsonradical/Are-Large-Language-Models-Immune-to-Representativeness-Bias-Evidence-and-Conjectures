Let's use Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem.

Define the events:
- \( A \): The selected deck is Deck A
- \( B \): The selected deck is Deck B
- \( D \): Drawing 4 cards, of which 3 are X and 1 is O

We want to find the posterior odds of \( A \) to \( B \), which can be written as:
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B | D) = \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)}. \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B | D) = \frac{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The odds ratio is therefore:
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)}. \]

Assuming equal prior probabilities, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)}. \]

Now, calculate \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: \( P(D | A) \).
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O: \( P(D | B) \).
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus, the posterior odds are:
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B | D) = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

So the final answer is:
{odds: 4}
