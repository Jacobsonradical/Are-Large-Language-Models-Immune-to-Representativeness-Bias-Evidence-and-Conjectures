To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem combined with the definition of odds.

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of B.

### Applying Bayes' Theorem to this Problem
Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the deck chosen is A.
- \( B \) be the event that 4 cards drawn contain 3 X's and 1 O.
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are both \(\frac{1}{2}\), as the decks were chosen by chance.

We need to compute the likelihoods:
1. \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
2. \( P(B | B') \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

**Deck A:**
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

Using combinations and the probability mass function for hypergeometric distribution:
\[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O}) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Deck B:**
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Similarly:
\[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O}) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds
The posterior odds ratio is given by the ratio of likelihoods and the prior odds:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{ P(B | A) }{ P(B | B') } \times \frac{ P(A) }{ P(B') }
\]

Since \( P(A) = P(B') = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{ P(B | A) }{ P(B | B') } = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

**{odds: 4}**
