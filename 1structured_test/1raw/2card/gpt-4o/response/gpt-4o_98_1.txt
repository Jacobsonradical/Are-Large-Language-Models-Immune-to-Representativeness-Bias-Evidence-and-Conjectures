To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O), we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the events:
- \( D_A \): The deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( D_B \): The deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

The posterior odds can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Posterior odds (Deck A vs Deck B)} = \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \]

By Bayes' theorem, this is given by:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E)} \div \frac{P(E \mid D_B) \cdot P(D_B)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B are equal, we have:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the odds become:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} \]

Next, we calculate the likelihoods \( P(E \mid D_A) \) and \( P(E \mid D_B) \).

1. For Deck A, where \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards are X's and \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards are O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. For Deck B, where \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards are X's and \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards are O's, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
