To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds.

We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck and then use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds of having drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote the following:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing the observed combination (3 X cards and 1 O card) given that we selected Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing the observed combination (3 X cards and 1 O card) given that we selected Deck B.

The prior probabilities, since we select one of the decks at random, are:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O) follows a multinomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O):
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B are calculated as:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{ \frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{ \frac{8}{81} \times 0.5 } \]
\[ = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
