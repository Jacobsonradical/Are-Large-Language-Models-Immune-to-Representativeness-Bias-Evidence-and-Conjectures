We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that the deck A was chosen.
- \( B \): The event that the deck B was chosen.
- \( D \): The event that 4 cards drawn result in 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to compute the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A \mid D)}{P(B \mid D)} \).

First, let's compute the probabilities for drawing 3 X's and 1 O given each deck:

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial formula:
\[ P(D \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ P(D \mid A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
\[ P(D \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ P(D \mid B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we calculate the prior probabilities \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\), which are each \( \frac{1}{2} \) since decks are equally likely to be chosen:

\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Where the total probability \( P(D) \) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid A)P(A) + P(D \mid B)P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

Now we can find \( P(A \mid D) \) and \( P(B \mid D) \):

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5} \]

\[ P(B \mid D) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Thus, the posterior odds are:

\[ \frac{P(A \mid D)}{P(B \mid D)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
