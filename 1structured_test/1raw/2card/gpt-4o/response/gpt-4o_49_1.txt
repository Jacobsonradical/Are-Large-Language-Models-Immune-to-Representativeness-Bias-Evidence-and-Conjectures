Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Given:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) for picking Deck A or Deck B initially since the selection was random.
- In Deck A, \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- In Deck B, \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \).

We need to find:
- \( P(3X, 1O | A) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(3X, 1O | B) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Bayes' theorem tells us the odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
