To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \( P(DATA|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(DATA|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( ODDS_A \) as the posterior odds in favor of Deck A.

Since the decks were chosen by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

1. Calculate \( P(DATA|A) \):

Deck A: 2/3 of cards are X, 1/3 are O.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by:
\[ P(DATA|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{8}{81} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. Calculate \( P(DATA|B) \):

Deck B: 1/3 of cards are X, 2/3 are O.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by:
\[ P(DATA|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{81} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(DATA|A)}{P(DATA|B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the prior odds are 1:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(DATA|A)}{P(DATA|B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
