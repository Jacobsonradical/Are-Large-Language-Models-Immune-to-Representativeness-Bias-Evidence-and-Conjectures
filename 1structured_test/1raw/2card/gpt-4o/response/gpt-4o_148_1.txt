To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood. The objective is to determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): Event that the deck selected is Deck A.
   - \( B \): Event that the deck selected is Deck B.
   - \( E \): Event of drawing 4 cards where 3 are X and 1 is O.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since the deck is selected at random between A and B)
   - \( P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E | A) \): The probability of drawing the sequence 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
     - In Deck A:
       - The probability of X = \(\frac{2}{3}\)
       - The probability of O = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

     The number of ways to arrange 3 X's and 1 O in 4 positions is given by binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{3}\):
       \[
       P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
       \]

   - \( P(E | B) \): The probability of drawing the sequence 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
     - In Deck B:
       - The probability of X = \(\frac{1}{3}\)
       - The probability of O = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

     Similar calculation:
       \[
       P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
       \]

4. **Posterior Odds:**
   Using Bayes' theorem, we need the posterior ratio:
   \[
   \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{P(E | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   Plug in the values:
   \[
   \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
