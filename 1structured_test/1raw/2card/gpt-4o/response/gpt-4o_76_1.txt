To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem in the form of odds.

Let \(D_A\) be the event of choosing Deck A, and \(D_B\) be the event of choosing Deck B. Let \(E\) be the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O. 

We are looking for the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem in the form of odds:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} \times \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} \]

Since the choice of deck is by chance, \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \), so:
\[ \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} = 1 \]

Now we need to compute the likelihoods \( P(E \mid D_A) \) and \( P(E \mid D_B) \):

1. For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X, 1/3 are O):
\[ P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X, 2/3 are O):
\[ P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

The ratio of the likelihoods is:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
