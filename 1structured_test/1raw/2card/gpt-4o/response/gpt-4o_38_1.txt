To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem tells us how to update our probabilities in the light of new evidence.

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

The prior probability \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are equal since the deck was selected by chance:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we calculate the posterior probabilities. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{81}{8} \cdot 2 \]
\[ = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
