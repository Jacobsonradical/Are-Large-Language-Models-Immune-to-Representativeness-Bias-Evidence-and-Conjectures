To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O), we use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem in terms of odds is:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \left( \frac{\text{Prior odds}}{1 - \text{Prior odds}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Likelihood of data under Deck A}}{\text{Likelihood of data under Deck B}} \right)
\]

Assuming a prior odds of 1:1 for simplicity (i.e., the decks are equally likely to be selected):

\[
\text{Prior odds} = 1
\]

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods.

### Likelihood of Data under Deck A
For Deck A (\(P(A) = \frac{2}{3}\) X's, \(\frac{1}{3}\) O's):

\[
P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

### Likelihood of Data under Deck B
For Deck B (\(P(B) = \frac{1}{3}\) X's, \(\frac{2}{3}\) O's):

\[
P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

### Posterior Odds
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \left( \frac{1}{1} \right) \times \left( \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \right) = 1 \times \left( \frac{32}{8} \right) = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

\[
\{ \text{odds: 4} \}
\]
