To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem in the context of odds. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( D_A \): The event that Deck A was chosen.
- \( D_B \): The event that Deck B was chosen.
- \( E \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O in the draw.

We need to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem for odds, we have:

\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} \times \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} \]

Since the decks are chosen with equal probability by random chance:

\[ \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} = 1 \]

We need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(E | D_A) \) and \( P(E | D_B) \).

First, let's find \( P(E | D_A) \):
Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \).
We need the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from this deck:

\[ P(E | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E | D_A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E | D_A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(E | D_A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, let's find \( P(E | D_B) \):
Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \).
We need the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from this deck:

\[ P(E | D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E | D_B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E | D_B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(E | D_B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can compute the posterior odds:

\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
