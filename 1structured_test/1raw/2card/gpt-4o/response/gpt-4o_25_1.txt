To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihoods. We want to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( H_A \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_A | E) = \frac{P(E | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_B | E) = \frac{P(E | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)}{P(E)} \]

We need to find the likelihoods:
\[ P(E | H_A) \text{ and } P(E | H_B) \]

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{1}{3}\)

Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the multinomial distribution:
\[ P(E | H_A) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Probability of drawing an O: \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(E | H_B) = \binom{4}{3,1} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

We assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially:
\[ P(H_A) = P(H_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now we find the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(E | H_B) \cdot P(H_B)} \]

Since \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E | H_A)}{P(E | H_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
