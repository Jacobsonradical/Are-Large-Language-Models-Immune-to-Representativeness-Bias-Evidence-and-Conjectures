To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we will use Bayes' Theorem. We will compare the likelihood of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) = Prior probability of selecting Deck A
- \( P(B) \) = Prior probability of selecting Deck B
- \( P(E \mid A) \) = Probability of observing the event (3 X's and 1 O) given that Deck A was chosen
- \( P(E \mid B) \) = Probability of observing the event (3 X's and 1 O) given that Deck B was chosen

Assuming each deck is equally likely to be chosen:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

First, compute \( P(E \mid A) \), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X from Deck A = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O from Deck A = \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The number of ways to choose 3 X's out of 4 draws and 1 O out of 4 draws:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

The probability of this sequence for Deck A:
\[ P(E \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

Calculating it:
\[ P(E \mid A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, compute \( P(E \mid B) \), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X from Deck B = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O from Deck B = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of this sequence for Deck B:
\[ P(E \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

Calculating it:
\[ P(E \mid B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

To find the posterior odds, we compute the ratio of these probabilities:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E \mid A)}{P(E \mid B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \):
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore,
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
