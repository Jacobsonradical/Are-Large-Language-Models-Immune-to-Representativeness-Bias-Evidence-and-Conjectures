To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote \( D_A \) as the event of drawing from Deck A and \( D_B \) as the event of drawing from Deck B. Also, let \( E \) be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We are interested in calculating the posterior odds:

\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \]

By Bayes' theorem, this can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} \]

Assuming the decks are equally likely to be chosen, \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) \), so we only need to compute the likelihoods \( P(E \mid D_A) \) and \( P(E \mid D_B) \).

### Likelihood Calculation

For Deck A (\(D_A\)):
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- The event E is drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:

\[ P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]

\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (\(D_B\)):
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- The event E is drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

\[ P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]

\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds

Now, we calculate the posterior odds:

\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} \]

\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
