To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem and calculate the likelihoods. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The event that the selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The event that the selected deck is Deck B.
- \( C \): The event that the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
\[ P(C | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(C | A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(C | A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{81} \right) \]
\[ P(C | A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
\[ P(C | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(C | B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(C | B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{81} \right) \]
\[ P(C | B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming an equal prior probability of selecting either deck (i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)):
\[ P(A | C) \propto P(C | A) \cdot P(A) \]
\[ P(A | C) \propto \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P(A | C) \propto \frac{16}{81} \]

\[ P(B | C) \propto P(C | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(B | C) \propto \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P(B | C) \propto \frac{4}{81} \]

The posterior odds are the ratio of these proportionalities:
\[ \frac{P(A | C)}{P(B | C)} = \frac{\frac{16}{81}}{\frac{4}{81}} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
