To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the concept of likelihood.

First, letâ€™s define the events:
- H_A: The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- H_B: The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- E: The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O out of 4 cards drawn.

The prior probabilities for selecting either deck are both 1/2 since one of the decks is chosen at random:
- P(H_A) = 1/2
- P(H_B) = 1/2

We need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- Likelihood from Deck A (where 2/3 are X and 1/3 are O):
  P(E|H_A) = (Combination(4, 3)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
  P(E|H_A) = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3)
  P(E|H_A) = 4 * (8/81)
  P(E|H_A) = 32/81

- Likelihood from Deck B (where 1/3 are X and 2/3 are O):
  P(E|H_B) = (Combination(4, 3)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
  P(E|H_B) = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3)
  P(E|H_B) = 4 * (2/81)
  P(E|H_B) = 8/81

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods times the prior odds (which is 1 in this case, since priors are equal):
Posterior odds = (P(E|H_A) / P(E|H_B)) * (P(H_A) / P(H_B))
               = (32/81) / (8/81) * (1/2) / (1/2)
               = 32/8
               = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
