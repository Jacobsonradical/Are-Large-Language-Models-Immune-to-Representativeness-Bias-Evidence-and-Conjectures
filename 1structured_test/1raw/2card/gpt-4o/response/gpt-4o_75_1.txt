To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem in terms of odds.

First, let's define the probabilities involved:
- \(P(A)\): Prior probability of selecting Deck A = \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- \(P(B)\): Prior probability of selecting Deck B = \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- \(P(E|A)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \(P(E|B)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since there is no prior preference, the prior odds are:
\[ \text{Prior odds of A vs B} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1 \]

Now we calculate \( P(E|A) \):
- From Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is calculated using the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Now we calculate \( P(E|B) \):
- From Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The likelihood ratio (or Bayes factor) is:
\[ \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
