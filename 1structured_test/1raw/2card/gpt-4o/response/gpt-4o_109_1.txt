To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. We'll compare the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A versus Deck B.

First, we'll calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The number of ways to arrange 3 X's and 1 O is given by \( \binom{4}{3} \) which is 4.

The probability of each specific combination of 3 X's and 1 O is:

\[ \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of one specific combination of 3 X's and 1 O is:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{81} \]

So, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A
- B as the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B
- E as the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn

We want to find the ratio \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \), the posterior odds that the cards come from Deck A versus Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The prior probability for selecting either Deck A or Deck B is equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, the posterior odds are:

\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
