To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. Given:

1. Probability of selecting Deck A (P(A)) = 0.5
2. Probability of selecting Deck B (P(B)) = 0.5

We need to find the posterior odds, which means we need to compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B and then compare these.

**Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.**

- The probability of drawing an X from Deck A = 2/3
- The probability of drawing an O from Deck A = 1/3

The combination of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be found using the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | A) = \(\binom{4}{3}\) * \((2/3)^3\) * \((1/3) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}\)

**Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.**

- The probability of drawing an X from Deck B = 1/3
- The probability of drawing an O from Deck B = 2/3

Similarly, the combination of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order:

P(3X, 1O | B) = \(\binom{4}{3}\) * \((1/3)^3\) * \((2/3) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}\)

**Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.**

The posterior odds in favor of A over B given the observation (3 X's and 1 O) can be calculated as the ratio of their likelihoods since the prior odds are equal (both decks are chosen with equal probability).

Odds(A:B) = \(\frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)}\)

Using equally likely priors (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5):

Odds(A:B) = \(\frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4\)

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
