To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D_A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(D_B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(E \ | \ D_A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck A was chosen.
- \( P(E \ | \ D_B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck B was chosen.

Since either deck is equally likely to be chosen:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(E \ | \ D_A) \) and \( P(E \ | \ D_B) \). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from 4 cards can be computed using combinations and the respective probabilities of drawing X and O from each deck.

For Deck A:
\[ P(X) = \frac{2}{3}, \ P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E \ | \ D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(X) = \frac{1}{3}, \ P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(E \ | \ D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are updated as follows:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D_A \ | \ E)}{P(D_B \ | \ E)} = \frac{P(E \ | \ D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E \ | \ D_B) P(D_B)} \]

Since \( P(D_A) \) and \( P(D_B) \) are equal and cancel each other out:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E \ | \ D_A)}{P(E \ | \ D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
