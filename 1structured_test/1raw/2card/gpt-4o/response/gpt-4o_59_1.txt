To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds.

First, we define the events:
- \( D_A \): Deck A is selected.
- \( D_B \): Deck B is selected.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

We need to find the odds \( \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \).

1. Prior odds:
Since one of the decks is selected by chance, the prior probability for both decks is equal:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

2. Likelihoods:
- \( P(E \mid D_A) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
  In Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \).
  \[
  P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- \( P(E \mid D_B) \): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
  In Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \).
  \[
  P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

3. Posterior odds:
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)} \]
Since \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
