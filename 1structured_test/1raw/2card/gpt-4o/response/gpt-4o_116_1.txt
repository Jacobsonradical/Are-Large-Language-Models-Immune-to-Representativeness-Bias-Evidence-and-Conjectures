To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5

Letâ€™s denote the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O as \( E \).

We need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(E|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O can likewise be calculated:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(E|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \]
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
Given \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), this simplifies to:
\[
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)}
\]
Substitute the probabilities we calculated:
\[ 
\frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
