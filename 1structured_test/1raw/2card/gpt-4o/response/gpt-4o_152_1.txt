To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. We then compare these likelihoods to find the desired odds.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(E|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(E|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Let's use the following equal prior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E|A) \) for Deck A:
\[ P(E|A) = \text{Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A} \]
In Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \) cards are X and \( \frac{1}{3} \) are O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A can be calculated as:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Now, we calculate \( P(E|B) \) for Deck B:
\[ P(E|B) = \text{Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B} \]
In Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \) cards are X and \( \frac{2}{3} \) are O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B can be calculated as:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability ratio (odds) of Deck A to Deck B based on the observed evidence is:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), they cancel out in the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given 3 X's and 1 O, are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
