To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we can utilize Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B
- \( P(E \mid A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A
- \( P(E \mid B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B

Since Deck A and Deck B are chosen with equal probability, we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E \mid A) \):

In Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The order in which the cards are drawn does not matter. Therefore, the binomial probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck A is:
\[ P(E \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E \mid A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E \mid A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(E \mid A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E \mid B) \):

In Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The binomial probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck B is:
\[ P(E \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E \mid B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E \mid B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(E \mid B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we find the posterior odds \( O(A:B) \):
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E \mid B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) \), the prior probabilities cancel out, so we have:
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{P(E \mid A)}{P(E \mid B)} \]
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ O(A:B) = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ O(A:B) = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
