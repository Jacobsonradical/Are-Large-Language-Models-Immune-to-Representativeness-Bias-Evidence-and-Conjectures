To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given the evidence of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. Let \( A \) represent the event that the deck chosen is Deck A.
2. Let \( B \) represent the event that the deck chosen is Deck B.
3. Let \( E \) represent the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

First, from the problem we know:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{2}. \]

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}. \]

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}. \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
