To solve this problem, we can use Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the posterior odds. 

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define the Events and Probabilities:**

   Let \( A \) be the event of drawing the cards from Deck A.
   Let \( B \) be the event of drawing the cards from Deck B.
   
   The priors:
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

   The likelihoods for drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
   - \( P(3X, 1O \mid A) \)
   - \( P(3X, 1O \mid B) \)

2. **Calculate the Likelihoods:**

   For Deck A (2/3 are X, 1/3 are O):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

   For Deck B (1/3 are X, 2/3 are O):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

3. **Compute the Posterior Odds:**

   The posterior odds are given by:
   \[
   \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   Given the priors are equal (\( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \)), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
