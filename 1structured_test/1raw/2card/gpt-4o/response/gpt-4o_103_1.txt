To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

1. **Define the events:**
    - Let \( A \) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
    - Let \( B \) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.

2. **Prior probabilities:** Since the deck was selected by chance, we assume:
    - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
    - \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

3. **Likelihoods:** Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.
    - For Deck A (\( 2/3 \) cards are X and \( 1/3 \) cards are O):
      \[
      P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
      \]
    - For Deck B (\( 1/3 \) cards are X and \( 2/3 \) cards are O):
      \[
      P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
      \]

4. **Posterior Odds:**
    \[
    \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A \mid 3X, 1O)}{P(B \mid 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
    \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

**{odds: 4}**
