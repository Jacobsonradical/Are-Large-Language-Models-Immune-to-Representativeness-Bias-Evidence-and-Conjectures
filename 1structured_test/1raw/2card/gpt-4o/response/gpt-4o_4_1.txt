To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B given the observed data. Let's denote the following:

- \(A\): Event that Deck A is chosen.
- \(B\): Event that Deck B is chosen.
- \(D\): Data observed, which is drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We need to calculate \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B)P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Thus, the odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} \]

Assume \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) since the decks are selected by chance.

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \). These represent the probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Under Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O = \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O can be computed using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Under Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, calculating the odds ratio:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\{odds: 4\}
