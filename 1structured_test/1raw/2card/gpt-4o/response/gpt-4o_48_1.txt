To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let \(A\) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A, and \(B\) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.

We need to find the posterior odds \(\frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})}\), where the data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Given:
- \(P(A)\) = \(P(B) = 0.5\) (since the deck is chosen at random)
- In Deck A: \(P(X) = \frac{2}{3}\), \(P(O) = \frac{1}{3}\)
- In Deck B: \(P(X) = \frac{1}{3}\), \(P(O) = \frac{2}{3}\)

The likelihood of the data (3 X and 1 O) given Deck A:
\[ P(\text{data} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood of the data (3 X and 1 O) given Deck B:
\[ P(\text{data} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data} | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
