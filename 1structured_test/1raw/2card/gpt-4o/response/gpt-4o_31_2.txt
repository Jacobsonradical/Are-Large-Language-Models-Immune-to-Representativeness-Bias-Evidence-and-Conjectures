Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

We'll define:
- \( A \) as the event that the selected deck is deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the selected deck is deck B.
- \( E \) as the event of drawing 4 cards such that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We are interested in finding the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

First, calculate the prior odds \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \). Since the deck was selected by chance:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]
So, the prior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \]

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \).

- For deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
    \[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
    \[ P(E|A) = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
    \[ P(E|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
    \[ P(E|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

- For deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is:
    \[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
    \[ P(E|B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
    \[ P(E|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
    \[ P(E|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

So the likelihood ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Finally, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \times \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
