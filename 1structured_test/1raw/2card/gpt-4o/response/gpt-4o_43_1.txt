To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the events:
- \( H_A \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( H_B \): The hypothesis that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to compute the posterior odds \(\frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)}\).

First, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_A | E) = \frac{P(E | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_B | E) = \frac{P(E | H_B) P(H_B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds \(\frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)}\) simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | H_A) P(H_A)}{P(E | H_B) P(H_B)} \]

Assume a uniform prior, such that \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \):
\[ \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | H_A)}{P(E | H_B)} \]

Now we need to calculate \( P(E | H_A) \) and \( P(E | H_B) \).

### For Deck A:
\[ P(E | H_A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### For Deck B:
\[ P(E | H_B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(H_A | E)}{P(H_B | E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:
{odds: 4}
