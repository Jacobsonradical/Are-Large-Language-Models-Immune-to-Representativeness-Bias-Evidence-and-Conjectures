To solve the problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds for Deck A compared to Deck B.

Bayes' theorem for odds is given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D) \cdot P(D)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( D \) is the event that Deck A is chosen
- \( B \) is the event that Deck B is chosen
- \( E \) is the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Given:
\[ P(D) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \] 
(Each deck is equally likely to be chosen initially)

Next, we need to calculate \( P(E|D) \) and \( P(E|B) \):
- \( P(E|D) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

Using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(E|D) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Since both \( P(D) \) and \( P(B) \) are \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|D) \cdot P(D)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
