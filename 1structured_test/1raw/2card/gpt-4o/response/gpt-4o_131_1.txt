To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, we identify the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Given that the selection of Deck A or Deck B is by chance, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let's calculate \( P(D|A) \):

In Deck A:
- \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be computed using the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

Now let's calculate \( P(D|B) \):

In Deck B:
- \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Likewise, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Given \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), it simplifies to:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
