To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( H_A \) be the hypothesis that the drawn cards came from Deck A, and \( H_B \) be the hypothesis that they came from Deck B. The prior odds for \( H_A \) and \( H_B \) are 1:1 because the deck was selected by chance.

We need the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability \( P(D \mid H_A) \) of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability \( P(D \mid H_B) \) of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(D \mid H_A)}{P(D \mid H_B)} \) is:
\[ \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \frac{P(H_A \mid D)}{P(H_B \mid D)} = 4 \]

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
