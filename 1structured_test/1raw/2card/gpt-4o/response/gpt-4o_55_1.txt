We will calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. Given that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card, we need to calculate the likelihood of this happening from Deck A and Deck B, and then use the prior probability of each deck being chosen to find the posterior odds.

First, let's define the problem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - P(A) = 1/2 (Probability of choosing Deck A)
   - P(B) = 1/2 (Probability of choosing Deck B)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - P(3X, 1O | A): The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
   - P(3X, 1O | B): The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.

**Deck A:**
- Probability of X: 2/3
- Probability of O: 1/3

**Deck B:**
- Probability of X: 1/3
- Probability of O: 2/3

### Calculation of Likelihoods

**Likelihood for Deck A:**

\[
P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
\]

**Likelihood for Deck B:**

\[
P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{81}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
\]

### Posterior Odds

We need the ratio of the posterior probabilities of choosing Deck A to Deck B. According to Bayes' theorem, these are proportional to the likelihood times the prior.

\[
\text{Posterior odds of A vs B} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{162}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{162}\right)} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
