To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. 

Let \(A\) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and \(B\) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We are given:
- Prior probability of selecting Deck A, \(P(A) = 0.5\)
- Prior probability of selecting Deck B, \(P(B) = 0.5\)

Let \(E\) be the event that 4 cards are drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We need to find the likelihoods:
- \(P(E|A)\), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \(P(E|B)\), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Using the binomial probability formula, we calculate these probabilities.

For Deck A:
The probability of drawing X is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the probability of drawing O is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) =  \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
The probability of drawing X is \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the probability of drawing O is \(\frac{2}{3}\).
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E)}, \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E)}. \]

We are interested in the odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \):
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
