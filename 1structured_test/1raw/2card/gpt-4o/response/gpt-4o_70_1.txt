To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood ratios.

Let's denote the following events:
- \(A\): The event that cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \(B\): The event that cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \(E\): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Given:
- Prior probability of choosing either deck (A or B) is equal, so \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\).
- In Deck A, \(P(X) = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(P(O) = \frac{1}{3}\).
- In Deck B, \(P(X) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(P(O) = \frac{2}{3}\).

We use the likelihood of drawing the sequence 3X and 1O from each deck:

1. **Calculate \(P(E|A)\):**
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. **Calculate \(P(E|B)\):**
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. **Calculate Posterior Odds:**
Posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are given by the ratio of the likelihoods \( P(E|A) \) to \( P(E|B) \), multiplied by the ratio of the priors \( P(A) \) to \( P(B) \):

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\), the ratio of the priors is 1:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are given by:

\[ {odds: 4} \]
