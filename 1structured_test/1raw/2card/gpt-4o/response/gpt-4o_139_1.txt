We need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

Let \( A \) denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and \( B \) denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the deck was chosen at random and there is no prior preference)
- From Deck A, the probability of drawing a card marked X is \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \), and the probability of drawing a card marked O is \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- From Deck B, the probability of drawing a card marked X is \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability of drawing a card marked O is \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \).

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probabilities. We only need the ratio of the posterior probabilities since the priors are uniform (0.5 for each deck):

\[ \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
