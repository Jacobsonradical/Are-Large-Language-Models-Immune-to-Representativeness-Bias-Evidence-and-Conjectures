To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards drawn (3 marked X and 1 marked O) came from Deck A, we'll need to employ Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The selected deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): Drawing 4 cards where 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to calculate the odds \( \frac{\Pr(A|D)}{\Pr(B|D)} \).

First, let's set up the initial prior odds which, given no additional information, assume both decks are equally likely to be chosen:
\[ \frac{\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)} = 1 \]

Next, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck using the hypergeometric distribution:
1. For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
   \[
   \Pr(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
   \[
   \Pr(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds are given by the ratio of these likelihoods:
\[
\frac{\Pr(A|D)}{\Pr(B|D)} = \frac{\Pr(D|A) \Pr(A)}{\Pr(D|B) \Pr(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
