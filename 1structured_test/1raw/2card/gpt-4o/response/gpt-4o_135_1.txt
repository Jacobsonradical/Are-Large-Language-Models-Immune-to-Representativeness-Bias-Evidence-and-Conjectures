To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the chosen deck is Deck A.
Let \( B \) be the event that the chosen deck is Deck B.

We need to find \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \), where \( D \) is the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)}
\]

Assume both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, so \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):

### Calculation of \( P(D|A) \):
In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula:

\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(D|A) = 4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

### Calculation of \( P(D|B) \):
In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:

\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(D|B) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now, calculate the posterior odds:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So the posterior odds are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
