We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote the events:
- \( A \): the selected deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): the selected deck is Deck B.
- \( X_3O_1 \): 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to find the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|X_3O_1)}{P(B|X_3O_1)} \]

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|X_3O_1) = \frac{P(X_3O_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X_3O_1)} \]
\[ P(B|X_3O_1) = \frac{P(X_3O_1|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(X_3O_1)} \]

The prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, so:

\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

The likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from decks A and B respectively are:

\[ P(X_3O_1|A) \]
\[ P(X_3O_1|B) \]

We can compute these using the binomial distribution. For Deck A (with \(2/3\) X and \(1/3\) O):

\[ P(X_3O_1|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (with \(1/3\) X and \(2/3\) O):

\[ P(X_3O_1|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|X_3O_1)}{P(B|X_3O_1)} = \frac{P(X_3O_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X_3O_1|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
