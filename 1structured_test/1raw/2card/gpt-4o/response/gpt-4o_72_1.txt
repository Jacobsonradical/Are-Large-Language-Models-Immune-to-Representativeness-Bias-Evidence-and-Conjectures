To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **Define the prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since both decks are equally likely to be chosen).

2. **Define the likelihoods**:
   - For Deck A: 2/3 X and 1/3 O.
   - For Deck B: 1/3 X and 2/3 O.

3. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A**:
   \[
   P(3 X, 1 O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

4. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B**:
   \[
   P(3 X, 1 O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{81}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

5. **Compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Theorem**:

   - Posterior probability for Deck A:
   \[
   P(A | 3 X, 1 O) = \frac{P(3 X, 1 O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3 X, 1 O)}
   \]

   - Posterior probability for Deck B:
   \[
   P(B | 3 X, 1 O) = \frac{P(3 X, 1 O | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(3 X, 1 O)}
   \]

   The evidence term \( P(3 X, 1 O) \) is the same in both cases, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

6. **Calculate the posterior odds**:
   \[
   \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | 3 X, 1 O)}{P(B | 3 X, 1 O)} = \frac{P(3 X, 1 O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3 X, 1 O | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
