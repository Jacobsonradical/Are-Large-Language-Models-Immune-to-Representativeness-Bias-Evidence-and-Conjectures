To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( D_A \): The deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( D_B \): The deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \]

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(D_A \mid E) \) is given by:
\[ P(D_A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E)} \]
and similarly,
\[ P(D_B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both equations, we can simplify the ratio as:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)} \]

Given that the decks are chosen by chance, we assume \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \). Hence, the ratio becomes:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B)} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E \mid D_A) \) and \( P(E \mid D_B) \):

1. **Calculating \( P(E \mid D_A) \):**
   - In Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
     \[ P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. **Calculating \( P(E \mid D_B) \):**
   - In Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
     \[ P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
