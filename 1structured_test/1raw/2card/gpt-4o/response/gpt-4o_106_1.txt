To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. 

Given:
- P(D_A) = 0.5 (prior probability of selecting Deck A)
- P(D_B) = 0.5 (prior probability of selecting Deck B)
- We have drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to find the posterior odds for Deck A versus Deck B given this draw.

First, we calculate the likelihood for each deck:
1. The likelihood for Deck A:

\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | D_A) = \text{Combination probability} = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. The likelihood for Deck B:

\[ P(3X \text{ and } 1O | D_B) = \text{Combination probability} = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using these likelihoods, the Bayes' factors (or normalization constants) cancel out, so we can compute the posterior odds directly from the likelihood ratio:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | D_A)}{P(3X \text{ and } 1O | D_B)} \cdot \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
