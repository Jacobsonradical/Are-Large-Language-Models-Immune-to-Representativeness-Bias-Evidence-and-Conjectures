To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds of having drawn the cards from Deck A compared to Deck B. 

Let's denote the following events:
- \( A \) is the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) is the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \) is the event that of the 4 cards drawn, 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We are looking for the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The odds we seek can be written as:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} \]

Because the decks are selected by chance (presuming equal probability), we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus, the odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(E|A) \), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(E|B) \), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus, the odds are:
\[ \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
