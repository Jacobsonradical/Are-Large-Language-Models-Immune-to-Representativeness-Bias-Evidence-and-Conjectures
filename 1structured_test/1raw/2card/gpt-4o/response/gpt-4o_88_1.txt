To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. The basic formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of the problem, we are interested in the ratio of \( P(A|E) \) to \( P(B|E) \), which simplifies to:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Let's define the events and their probabilities:

1. \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - This is because each deck is equally likely to have been selected.

2. \( P(E|A) \)
   - This is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

   Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck A is:
   \[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

3. \( P(E|B) \)
   - This is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
   - In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

   Therefore, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck B is:
   \[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
