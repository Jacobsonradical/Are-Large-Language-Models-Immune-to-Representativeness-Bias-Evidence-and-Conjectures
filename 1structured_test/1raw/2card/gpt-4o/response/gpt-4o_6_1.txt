To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probabilities for each deck given the observed data, and then we calculate the odds.

1. Calculate the probability of drawing the observed set of cards (3 X's and 1 O) from each deck.

2. Use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

3. Calculate the odds based on these posterior probabilities.

First, let’s define the events:
- \( A \): Deck A is selected.
- \( B \): Deck B is selected.
- \( D \): Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the deck.

We want to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \). 

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B)P(B)}{P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B)} \]

Since the deck is chosen at random:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we substitute these into Bayes’ formula:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}\right)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{40}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]

\[ P(B|D) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}\right)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81}}{\frac{40}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\{odds: 4\}
