To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior odds.

First, letâ€™s define the relevant events:
- \( A \): The event that cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \): The event that cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \): The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The prior probabilities (since the deck is chosen at random):
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

We need the probabilities of drawing the specific combination of cards (3 X and 1 O) from each deck:
- From Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
  \[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \frac{8}{27} \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- From Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
  \[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \frac{1}{27} \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The marginal probability of drawing this combination of cards (3 X and 1 O) from either deck can be found by using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

To find the posterior probability \( P(A|E) \):
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5} \]

To find the posterior probability \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Finally, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
