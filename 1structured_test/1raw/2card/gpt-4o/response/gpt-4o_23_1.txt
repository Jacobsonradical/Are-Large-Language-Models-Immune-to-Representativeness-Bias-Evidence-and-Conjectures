To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. Let's denote the event that Deck A is chosen as \( H_A \) and the event that Deck B is chosen as \( H_B \). The observed evidence is drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card, which we denote as \( E \).

First, let's determine the prior odds. Since either deck is equally likely to be chosen at the start, the prior odds \( \frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_B)} \) are 1 (i.e., both have a probability of 0.5).

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:
- For Deck A: The probability of drawing an X card is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and an O card is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
  The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
  \[
  P(E|H_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- For Deck B: The probability of drawing an X card is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and an O card is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
  The likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
  \[
  P(E|H_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds \( \frac{P(H_A|E)}{P(H_B|E)} \) is given by:
\[
\frac{P(H_A|E)}{P(H_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(E|H_B) \cdot P(H_B)}
\]

Since \( P(H_A) = P(H_B) = 0.5 \), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{P(H_A|E)}{P(H_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|H_A)}{P(E|H_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
