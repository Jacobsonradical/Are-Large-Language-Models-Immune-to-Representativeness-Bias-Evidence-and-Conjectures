Let's solve this step-by-step using Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior odds.

First, let's define the events:
- \(D_A\): The event that Deck A is selected.
- \(D_B\): The event that Deck B is selected.
- \(E\): The event that 4 cards drawn show 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to find the posterior odds \(\frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)}\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(D_A | E) = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(D_B | E) = \frac{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)}{P(E)} \]

The odds ratio would be:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)} \]

Assuming the prior probability is 0.5 for each deck (since it is selected by chance):
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we calculate \(P(E | D_A)\) and \(P(E | D_B)\):

**For Deck A:**
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (where \( \frac{2}{3} \) are X and \( \frac{1}{3} \) are O):

Using the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(E | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**For Deck B:**
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (where \( \frac{1}{3} \) are X and \( \frac{2}{3} \) are O):

Using the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(E | D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, plug these probabilities back into the odds ratio formula:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B)P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
