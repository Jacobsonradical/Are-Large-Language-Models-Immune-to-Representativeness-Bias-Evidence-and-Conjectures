We can use Bayes' theorem to solve the problem. Let's denote:

- \( D_A \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( D_B \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \) as the event that of the 4 cards drawn, 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} \).

First, let's calculate the likelihoods \( P(E|D_A) \) and \( P(E|D_B) \).

From Deck A, probability of drawing a marked X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{1}{3} \):
- \( P(3X, 1O|D_A) \) can be calculated using the binomial formula.
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 cards to be X and 1 to be O: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Probability leading to this combination: \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \).

\[ P(3X, 1O|D_A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}. \]

From Deck B, probability of drawing a marked X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \frac{2}{3} \):
- \( P(3X, 1O|D_B) \) can be calculated using the binomial formula.
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 cards to be X and 1 to be O: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Probability leading to this combination: \( \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \).

\[ P(3X, 1O|D_B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}. \]

Now, apply the odds form of Bayes' theorem:

\[ \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)} \cdot \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)}, \]

Assuming the decks were selected with equal probability:

\[ \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} = 1. \]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

\[ \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
