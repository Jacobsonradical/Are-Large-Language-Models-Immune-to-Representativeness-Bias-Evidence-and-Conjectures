To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. We'll calculate the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from each deck and use these likelihoods to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) given that Deck A was chosen.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of drawing the observed cards (3 X's and 1 O) given that Deck B was chosen.

Since the decks were chosen randomly:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):

For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probabilities are proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood:

\[ P(A|D) \propto P(D|A) \cdot P(A) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{32}{162} = \frac{16}{81} \]
\[ P(B|D) \propto P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{8}{162} = \frac{4}{81} \]

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{16}{81}}{\frac{4}{81}} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are:
\[ {odds: 4} \]
