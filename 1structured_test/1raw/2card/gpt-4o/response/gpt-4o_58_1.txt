To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \(A\): Cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \(B\): Cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \(D\): Observing the four draws, 3 X and 1 O.

We need to calculate the posterior odds \( P(A|D) / P(B|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to find the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O):
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O):
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32 \cdot 0.5}{81}}{\frac{8 \cdot 0.5}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
