To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given the observed outcome of 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): The deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( D \): Drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

First, calculate the individual probabilities for drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (\( P(D|A) \)):**
   - From Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   - The specific sequence probability (3 X's and 1 O) can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:
     \[
     P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (\( P(D|B) \)):**
   - From Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - The specific sequence probability (3 X's and 1 O) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

Next, assuming that each deck is equally likely to be chosen initially (\( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)):
- Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior odds:
  \[
  \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
  \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
