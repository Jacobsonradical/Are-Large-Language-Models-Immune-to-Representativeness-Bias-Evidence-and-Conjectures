To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem, specifically for calculating odds. The posterior odds in favor of Deck A given the data can be computed by considering the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(\text{A}) \) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(\text{B}) \) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{A}) \) is the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{B}) \) is the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Assuming there's an equal chance of picking either deck, we have:
\[ P(\text{A}) = P(\text{B}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

We must now calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27} \right) \left(\frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27} \right) \left(\frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B are given by:
\[ \frac{P(\text{A} \mid \text{3X, 1O})}{P(\text{B} \mid \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{A})}{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid \text{B})} \cdot \frac{P(\text{A})}{P(\text{B})} \]

Since \( \frac{P(\text{A})}{P(\text{B})} = 1 \):
\[ \frac{P(\text{A} \mid \text{3X, 1O})}{P(\text{B} \mid \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
