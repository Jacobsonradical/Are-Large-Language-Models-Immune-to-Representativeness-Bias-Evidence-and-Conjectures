To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( D_A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( D_B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( E \): The event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We are asked to find the posterior odds, which is \( \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(D_A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(D_B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)}{P(E)}
\]
Hence the posterior odds is:
\[
\frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)}
\]

Since the decks are selected by chance:
\[
P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5
\]

We need to calculate \( P(E \mid D_A) \) and \( P(E \mid D_B) \).

For Deck A where \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[
P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B where \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Now, the posterior odds are:
\[
\frac{P(E \mid D_A) P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\{odds: 4\}
