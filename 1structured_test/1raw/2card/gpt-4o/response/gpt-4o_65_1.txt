To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability that Deck A is chosen.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability that Deck B is chosen.
- \( P(3X,1O|A) \) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(3X,1O|B) \) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since the deck is chosen by chance, we assume the prior probabilities are equal: 
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Likelihood Calculation

From Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A:
\[ P(3X,1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

From Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B:
\[ P(3X,1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Calculation

We want to know the posterior odds \(\frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)}\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|3X,1O) = \frac{P(3X,1O|A) P(A)}{P(3X,1O)} \]
\[ P(B|3X,1O) = \frac{P(3X,1O|B) P(B)}{P(3X,1O)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), we only need to compare the likelihoods:
\[ \frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)} = \frac{P(3X,1O|A)}{P(3X,1O|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So the posterior odds are:

\[ {odds: 4} \]
