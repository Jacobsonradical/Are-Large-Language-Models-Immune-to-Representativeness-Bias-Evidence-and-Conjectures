To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B. The calculation involves the prior probabilities of choosing each deck, and the likelihood of drawing the observed combination of cards from each deck.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - P(A) = 0.5 (probability of selecting Deck A)
   - P(B) = 0.5 (probability of selecting Deck B)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - P(D | A): Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A
   - P(D | B): Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B

First, calculate P(D | A):
- In Deck A: P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- The combination is 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, calculate P(D | B):
- In Deck B: P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3
- The combination is 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. **Posterior Odds:**
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D | B) \cdot P(B)} \]
Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \):
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
