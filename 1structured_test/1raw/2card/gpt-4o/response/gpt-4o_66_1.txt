To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the notation:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B. Since either deck is equally likely, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

- Let \( D \) be the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O out of 4 cards:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we can compare the posterior probabilities using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), they cancel out:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 4}
