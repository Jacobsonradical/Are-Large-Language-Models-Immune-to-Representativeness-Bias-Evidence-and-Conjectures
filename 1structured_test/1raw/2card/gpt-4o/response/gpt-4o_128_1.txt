To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the events:

- \( D_A \): The event that Deck A was selected.
- \( D_B \): The event that Deck B was selected.
- \( E \): The event that we draw 4 cards of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} \).

First, let’s calculate the probabilities of drawing the specific combination of cards from each deck.

**For Deck A:**

- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O from Deck A, considering the order does not matter, is:

\[
P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

**For Deck B:**

- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O from Deck B, considering the order does not matter, is:

\[
P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Next, we assume that the prior probability of selecting each deck is equal, i.e., \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Using Bayes’ Theorem, we find the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(D_A|E) = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(D_B|E) = \frac{P(E|D_B) \cdot P(D_B)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we only need the ratio:

\[
\frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)} = \frac{P(E|D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E|D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
