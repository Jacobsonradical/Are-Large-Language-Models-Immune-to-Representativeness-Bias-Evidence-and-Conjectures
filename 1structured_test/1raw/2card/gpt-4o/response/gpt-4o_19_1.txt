To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   The prior probability of selecting Deck A, \(P(A)\), is 0.5.
   The prior probability of selecting Deck B, \(P(B)\), is also 0.5.

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We need the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

   For Deck A, where \(P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3}\):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

   For Deck B, where \(P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3}\):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

3. **Posterior probabilities:**
   According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood.

   \[
   P(A | 3X, 1O) \propto P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{16}{81}
   \]

   \[
   P(B | 3X, 1O) \propto P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B) = \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{4}{81}
   \]

4. **Posterior odds:**
   The posterior odds are the ratio of these two posterior probabilities.

   \[
   \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{\frac{16}{81}}{\frac{4}{81}} = \frac{16}{4} = 4
   \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
