To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this case, we want to compute the posterior odds of having chosen Deck A given the observed data (4 cards drawn: 3 X's and 1 O).

Let's denote:
- \(P(A)\): Prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \(P(B)\): Prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \(P(E|A)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \(P(E|B)\): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since the decks are selected by chance, the prior probabilities for both decks are equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to calculate \(P(E|A)\) and \(P(E|B)\).

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \). We need to consider the combination of drawing the 4 cards in any order where 3 are X and 1 is O.

\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Similar to the above calculation:

\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we have everything we need to compute the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds are:

\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
