To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): The deck chosen is Deck A.
   - \( B \): The deck chosen is Deck B.
   - \( D \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - \( P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - Given Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
     \[
     P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - Given Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
     \[
     P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

4. **Posterior probabilities:**
   - By Bayes' theorem, \( P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D)} \) and \( P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B)P(B)}{P(D)} \).

   However, for the odds, we only need the ratio of these probabilities.

   \[
   \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

So the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
