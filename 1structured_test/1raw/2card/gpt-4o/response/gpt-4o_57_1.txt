To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we define the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since either deck can be chosen by chance, we have \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \) are the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Next, we calculate \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \) using the binomial distribution.

For Deck A:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E|B) P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), they cancel each other out, so:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
