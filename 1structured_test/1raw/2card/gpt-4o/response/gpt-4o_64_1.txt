To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' Theorem. This involves calculating the likelihood of drawing the observed cards from each deck and then comparing those likelihoods.

First, we need to determine the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

### Step 1: Determine individual probabilities

**Draw from Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):**
The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Draw from Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):**
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Step 2: Use Bayes' Theorem
We need to compare the likelihoods of drawing the cards from each deck and compute the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} \]
Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds are proportional to the relative likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Given that the selection of decks is equally likely, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) cancels out:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

**Answer:**
```{odds: 4}```
