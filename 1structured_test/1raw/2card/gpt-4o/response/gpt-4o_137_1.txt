To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' theorem and calculate the probabilities accordingly.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A, which is 0.5.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B, which is also 0.5.

Let:
- \( P(E | A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(E | B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, and Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's:

Using the binomial distribution formula:

\[ P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]

\[ P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]

Compute these:

\[ P(E | A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(E | B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, we find the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | E) = \frac{P(E | A) \times P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \times P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E | A) \times P(A) + P(E | B) \times P(B) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{32}{81} \times 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

Now compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(A | E) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{16}{20} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{4}{20} = 0.2 \]

Finally, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A compared to Deck B is:

\[ \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 4}
