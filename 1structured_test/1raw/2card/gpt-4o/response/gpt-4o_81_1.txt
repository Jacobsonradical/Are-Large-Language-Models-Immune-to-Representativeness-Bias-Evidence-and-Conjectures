To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we'll use Bayesian inference.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \): Probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5 (since the deck is selected by chance).
- \( P(B) \): Probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5.
- \( P(\text{3X}, \text{1O} | A) \): Probability of drawing 3X and 1O given Deck A.
- \( P(\text{3X}, \text{1O} | B) \): Probability of drawing 3X and 1O given Deck B.

The posterior odds are computed as:
\[ \frac{P(A| \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B| \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) \). Since in Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the probability of drawing an O is \(\frac{1}{3}\), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated using the binomial theorem:

\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1
= 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
= 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3}
= \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) \). Since in Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the probability of drawing an O is \(\frac{2}{3}\), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated as:

\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1
= 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
= 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3}
= \frac{8}{81} \]

Given that \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the posterior odds are:

\[ \frac{P(A| \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B| \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
