To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (compared to Deck B), we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of drawing from Deck A, which is 0.5.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of drawing from Deck B, which is also 0.5.
- \( P(X = 3 \text{ and } O = 1 | A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- \( P(X = 3 \text{ and } O = 1 | B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ \frac{P(A | X = 3, O = 1)}{P(B | X = 3, O = 1)} = \frac{P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

First, we compute \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) \):

\[
P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

Next, we compute \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) \):

\[
P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

Given \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the odds ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{P(A | X = 3, O = 1)}{P(B | X = 3, O = 1)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
