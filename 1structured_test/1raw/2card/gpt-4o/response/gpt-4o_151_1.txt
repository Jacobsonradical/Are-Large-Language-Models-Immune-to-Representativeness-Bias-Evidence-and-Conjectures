To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- Deck A: P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- Deck B: P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck. Then, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let's denote:
- P(D|A) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(D|B) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (in any order) is given by the binomial coefficient and the respective probabilities for each deck:

For Deck A:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, we need the prior probabilities which are equal since the deck is selected by chance:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

We are interested in the odds ratio:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since both priors are equal, they cancel out:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[ \{odds: 4\} \]
