To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem along with the odds form.

First, letâ€™s define the events:
- \( A \): The event that Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O) was chosen.
- \( B \): The event that Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O) was chosen.
- \( D \): The event that 3 of the 4 drawn cards are X and 1 is O.

We need to determine \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \), the posterior odds of A to B given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem, we know:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} \]

Assuming both decks have equal probability of being chosen:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now we need to find \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O out of 4 cards:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O out of 4 cards:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Thus:
\[ \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

\[ \{ \text{odds: 4} \} \]
