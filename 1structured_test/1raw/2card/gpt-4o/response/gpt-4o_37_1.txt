To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( D_A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( D_B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( E \): The event that 4 cards drawn include 3 X's and 1 O.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck is chosen by chance:
\[ P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**

Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from both decks using the binomial probability formula:

- For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
\[ P(E | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

- For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
\[ P(E | D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. **Posterior Odds Using Bayes' Theorem:**

First, calculate the ratios of the likelihoods:
\[ \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Since the prior probabilities are equal, the prior odds are 1:1:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D_A | E)}{P(D_B | E)} = \frac{P(E | D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E | D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} = \frac{P(E | D_A)}{P(E | D_B)} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

### Final Answer:
\{odds: 4\}
