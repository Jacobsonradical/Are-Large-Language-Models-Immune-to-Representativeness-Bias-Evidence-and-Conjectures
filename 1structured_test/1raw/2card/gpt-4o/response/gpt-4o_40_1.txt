To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds. Let's go through the calculations step by step.

1. **Prior Odds**:
   Since the deck is selected by chance and there is no information provided that gives a preference to either deck, we assume the prior odds are 1:1. This means \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.
   
   - For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   
   - For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Posterior Odds**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds are given by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
   \[
   \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   Given the prior odds are 1:1, we have:
   \[
   \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
