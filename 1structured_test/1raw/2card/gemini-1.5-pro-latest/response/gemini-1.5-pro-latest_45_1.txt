Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly chose one of the two decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing the observed sequence from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing the observed sequence from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) 

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can express this as:

* Posterior odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
* Posterior odds = (8/27) / (2/27) 
* Posterior odds = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4 to 1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B.
