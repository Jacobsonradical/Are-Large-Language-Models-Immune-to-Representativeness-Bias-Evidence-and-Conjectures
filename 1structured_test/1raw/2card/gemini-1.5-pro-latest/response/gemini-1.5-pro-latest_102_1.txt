Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Likelihood of the Draw from Each Deck**

* **Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Deck B:** The probability of the same draw from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**2. Prior Odds**

The decks were selected with equal probability, so the prior odds are 1:1.

**3.  Calculating Posterior Odds**

Posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4
* **Posterior Odds:** (1/1) * 4 = 4/1 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1, meaning it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
