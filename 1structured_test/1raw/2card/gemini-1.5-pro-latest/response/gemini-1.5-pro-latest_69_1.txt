Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let `A` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let `B` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let `D` be the event of observing the data (3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* `P(A) = 1/2` (We chose the deck randomly, so the prior probability of either deck is equal).
* `P(B) = 1/2` 

**3. Likelihoods**

* `P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1` (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' given Deck A)
* `P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1` (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed using Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

Since `P(A) = P(B)`, they cancel out, leaving:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)
```

**5. Calculation**

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] 
                 = (8/27) / (2/27)
                 = 4
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means it's four times more likely the cards came from Deck A given the observed data.
