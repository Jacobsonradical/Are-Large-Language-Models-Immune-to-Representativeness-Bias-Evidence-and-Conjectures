Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The decks were selected by chance, so the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal:

* P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2

**2. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given each deck:

* **Deck A:**  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Deck B:** (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**3.  Unnormalized Posterior Probabilities**

Multiply the prior odds by the likelihoods:

* Unnormalized P(Deck A | Data) = (1/2) * (8/81) = 4/81
* Unnormalized P(Deck B | Data) = (1/2) * (2/81) = 1/81

**4. Posterior Odds**

Divide the unnormalized posterior probabilities to get the posterior odds:

* Posterior Odds (Deck A : Deck B) = (4/81) / (1/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
