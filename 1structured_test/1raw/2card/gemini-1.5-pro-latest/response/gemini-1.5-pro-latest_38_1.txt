Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
                 = (8/27) / (2/27) 
                 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1, meaning it is 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B.
