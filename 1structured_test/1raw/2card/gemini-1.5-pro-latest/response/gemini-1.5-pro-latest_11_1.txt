Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed using Bayes' Theorem and then simplified to focus on the likelihood ratio:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] = [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), the posterior odds simplify to the likelihood ratio:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

**5. Calculation**

* P(D|A) / P(D|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] = 8

**Answer**

{odds: 8}

This means that the odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A are 8 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, given the observed data.
