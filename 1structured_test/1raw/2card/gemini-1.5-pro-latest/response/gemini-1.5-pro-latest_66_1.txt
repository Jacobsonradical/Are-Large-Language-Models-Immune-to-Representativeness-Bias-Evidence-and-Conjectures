Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The probability of selecting either deck is equal (1/2), so the prior odds are:

* Odds (A : B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from deck A is:  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81 
* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck B:** The probability of the same draw from deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio

Posterior Odds (A : B) = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
