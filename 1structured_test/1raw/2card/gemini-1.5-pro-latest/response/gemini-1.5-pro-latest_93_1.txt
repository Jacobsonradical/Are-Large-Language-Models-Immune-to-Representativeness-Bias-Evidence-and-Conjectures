Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Likelihoods**

*   **Likelihood of observing the draw (3 Xs, 1 O) from Deck A:** 
    * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
*   **Likelihood of observing the draw from Deck B:** 
    * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

**2. Prior Odds**

* The decks were selected by chance, so the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal: 1:1

**3.  Calculating the Posterior Odds**

* **Posterior odds for Deck A = (Likelihood of A) * (Prior odds of A) / (Likelihood of B)**
* Posterior odds for Deck A = (8/81) * (1) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed draw came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
