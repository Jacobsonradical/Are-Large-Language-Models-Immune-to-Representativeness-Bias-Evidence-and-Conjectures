Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We choose the deck randomly, so the initial probability is equal for both).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [(P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)] / [(P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)]

This simplifies to:

[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

**5. Calculation**

* P(D|A) = 8/81
* P(D|B) = 2/81

Plugging these values into the odds calculation:

[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2) = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A than from Deck B.
