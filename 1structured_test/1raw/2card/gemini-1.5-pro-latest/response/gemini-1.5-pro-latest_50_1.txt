Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A compared to Deck B before any cards are drawn. Since the decks were chosen randomly, the prior odds are 1:1 (or simply 1).

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A is  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck B:** The probability of the same draw from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81.
* **Likelihood ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio**
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
