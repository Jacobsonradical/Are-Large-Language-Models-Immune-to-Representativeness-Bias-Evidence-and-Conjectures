Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The probability of choosing either deck is equal: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2
* Prior odds of Deck A to Deck B: P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 Xs, 1 O) given Deck A:**
   * P(Data | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   * P(Data | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
* **Likelihood ratio:**  (P(Data | A)) / (P(Data | B)) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio
* Posterior odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.**

**Answer:** {odds: 4}
