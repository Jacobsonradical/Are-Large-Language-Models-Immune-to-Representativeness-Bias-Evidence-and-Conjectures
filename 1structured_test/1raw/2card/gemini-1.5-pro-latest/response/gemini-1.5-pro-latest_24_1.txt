Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Odds**

The decks were chosen randomly, so the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  = 8/81 
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

**4. Posterior Odds**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds:

```
Posterior Odds (A:B) =  [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)] 
```

* **[P(D|A) / P(D|B)]** = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4  (This is the likelihood ratio)
* **[P(A) / P(B)]** = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1 (This is the prior odds ratio)

Therefore:

* Posterior Odds (A:B) = 4 * 1 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

**Conclusion:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.
