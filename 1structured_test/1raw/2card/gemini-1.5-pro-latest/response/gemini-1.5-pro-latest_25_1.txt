Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Since a deck is chosen randomly)

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of getting the data given Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of getting the data given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed using Bayes' Theorem as:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* P(D|A) = 8/81
* P(D|B) = 2/81

Since P(A) = P(B), they cancel out in the odds calculation:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's 4 times more likely that the observed data came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
