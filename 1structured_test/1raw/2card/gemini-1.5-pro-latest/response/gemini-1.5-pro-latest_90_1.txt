Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The probability of choosing either deck is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 Xs, 1 O) given Deck A:** 
   * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 mean it's four times more likely that the four cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are X) compared to Deck B.
