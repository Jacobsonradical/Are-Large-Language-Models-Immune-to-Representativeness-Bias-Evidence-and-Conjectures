Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Prior Odds**

* The probability of choosing either deck is initially equal (1/2), so the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A is  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:**  (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio: (1/1) * 4 = 4/1 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1, meaning it's four times more likely the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
