Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Likelihoods**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 X's, 1 O) given Deck A:**
   *  (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

**2. Prior Odds**

The prior odds are 1:1 since each deck was equally likely to be chosen.

**3.  Calculating the Posterior Odds**

* **Multiply the likelihood ratios by the prior odds:** 
   (8/81) / (2/81)  * 1/1 = 4/1

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1, meaning it's 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed data.
