Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck A was chosen)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck B was chosen)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

[P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1, meaning it's 4 times more likely the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
