Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The prior odds represent the likelihood of each deck being selected *before* seeing the drawn cards. Since the deck was chosen randomly, the prior odds are:

* Odds(A) = 1 (Deck A being chosen)
* Odds(B) = 1 (Deck B being chosen)

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

We need to calculate how likely the observed draw (3 Xs and 1 O) is under each deck's composition:

* **Likelihood of Draw given Deck A:** 
   * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of Draw given Deck B:**
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is then:  (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

* Posterior Odds(A) = Odds(A) * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * 4 = 4 
* Posterior Odds(B) = Odds(B) * Likelihood Ratio = 1 * 1 = 1 

Therefore, the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
