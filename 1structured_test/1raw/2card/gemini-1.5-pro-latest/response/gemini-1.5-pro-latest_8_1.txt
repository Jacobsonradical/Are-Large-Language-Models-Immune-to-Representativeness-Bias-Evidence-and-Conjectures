Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Likelihoods**

* **Likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:** 
   * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:**
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**2. Prior Odds**

* The decks were selected with equal probability, so the prior odds are 1:1 

**3.  Unnormalized Posterior Odds**

* Multiply the prior odds by the likelihoods:
    * Deck A:  1 * (8/81) = 8/81
    * Deck B:  1 * (2/81) = 2/81

**4. Posterior Odds**

* Divide the unnormalized posterior odds of Deck A by the unnormalized posterior odds of Deck B:
    * (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
