Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A compared to Deck B before any cards are drawn. Since the deck is selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means that the odds are 4:1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
