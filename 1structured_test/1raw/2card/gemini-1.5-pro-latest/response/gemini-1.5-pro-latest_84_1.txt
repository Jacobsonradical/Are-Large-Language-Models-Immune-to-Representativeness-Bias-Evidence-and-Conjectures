Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card. 

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly chose one of the decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 (Same reasoning as above)

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Calculate Posterior Odds**

We want to find the odds of the cards coming from Deck A *given* we observed the draw, or P(A|D) compared to the odds of the cards coming from Deck B given the observed draw, P(B|D).  We can express this ratio in terms of Bayes Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Substitute the values we calculated:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)] = 8/1 = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

The posterior odds are 8:1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
