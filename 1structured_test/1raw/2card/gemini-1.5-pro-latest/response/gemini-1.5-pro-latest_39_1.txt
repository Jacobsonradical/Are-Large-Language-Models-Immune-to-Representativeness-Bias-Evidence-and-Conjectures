Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Event A: The cards were drawn from deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O)
* Event B: The cards were drawn from deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O)
* Event D: Drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. State Prior Probabilities**

Since the decks were chosen randomly, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2 
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Calculate Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (event D) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81   (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem lets us calculate the posterior probabilities:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

To find the posterior odds, we take the ratio of these probabilities:

Odds(A:B) = [P(A|D)] / [P(B|D)] =  [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), they cancel out, leaving:

Odds(A:B) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
