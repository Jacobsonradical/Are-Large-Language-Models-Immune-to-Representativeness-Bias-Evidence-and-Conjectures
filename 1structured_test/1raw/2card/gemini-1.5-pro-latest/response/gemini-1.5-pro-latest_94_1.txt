Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A).
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means the observed data makes it four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A.
