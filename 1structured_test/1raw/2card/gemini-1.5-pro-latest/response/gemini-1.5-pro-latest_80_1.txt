Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Prior Odds**

* The probability of choosing either deck is equal, so the prior odds of choosing Deck A over Deck B are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck A:**  The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A is calculated using the binomial probability formula: 
   (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81

* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B is:
   (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

* **Likelihood Ratio:** (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio**
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4 indicate that it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are 'X') compared to Deck B.
