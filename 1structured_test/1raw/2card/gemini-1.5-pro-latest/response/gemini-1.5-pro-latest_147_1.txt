Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A versus Deck B before any cards are drawn. Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1, meaning they are equally likely.

**2. Likelihoods**

* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck A:**  The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of the draw given Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**3.  Calculating Posterior Odds**

We use Bayes' Theorem (in odds form) to calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio

Where the Likelihood Ratio is: (Likelihood of draw given Deck A) / (Likelihood of draw given Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore:

Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means that after observing the draw of 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card, the odds are now 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A (where 'X' is more common) compared to Deck B.
