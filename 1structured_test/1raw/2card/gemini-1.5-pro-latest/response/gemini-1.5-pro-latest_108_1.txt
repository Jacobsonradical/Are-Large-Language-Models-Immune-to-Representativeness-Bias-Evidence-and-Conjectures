Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds:** Since the decks were chosen randomly, the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal:

* P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2

**2. Likelihoods:** We need to calculate the probability of observing the drawn cards (3 Xs and 1 O) given each deck:

* **Likelihood of observing the draw from Deck A:**
   * P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 
* **Likelihood of observing the draw from Deck B:**
   * P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**  To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

* P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)] / P(3X, 1O)
* P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)] / P(3X, 1O)

Since we are interested in the odds, we can simplify by taking the ratio:

* **Posterior Odds = [P(Deck A | 3X, 1O)] / [P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)]** 
                   = [(8/81 * 1/2) / P(3X, 1O)] / [(2/81 * 1/2) / P(3X, 1O)]
                   = (8/81) / (2/81)
                   = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed draw came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
