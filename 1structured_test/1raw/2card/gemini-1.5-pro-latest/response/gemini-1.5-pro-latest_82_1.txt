Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The probability of selecting either deck is equal (1/2), so the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio 
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.**

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
