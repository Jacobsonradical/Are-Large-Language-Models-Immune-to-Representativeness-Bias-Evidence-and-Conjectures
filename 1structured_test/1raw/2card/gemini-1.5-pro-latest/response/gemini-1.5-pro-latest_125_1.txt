Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
*  Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
*  Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other).
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D) 
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

* [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] =  [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), they cancel out, leaving:

*  [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

**5. Calculation**

*  [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
