Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let E be the event of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We choose a deck at random, so the initial probability of choosing either deck is equal).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|E) and P(B|E):

```
Odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) 
```

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

```
Odds = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]
```

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the probabilities we calculated:

```
Odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
     = (8/27) / (2/27)
     = 4 
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
