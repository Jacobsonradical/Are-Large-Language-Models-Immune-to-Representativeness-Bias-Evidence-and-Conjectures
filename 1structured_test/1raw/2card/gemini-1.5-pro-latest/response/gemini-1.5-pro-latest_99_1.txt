Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
                = 8 / 1 
                = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

The posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B. This means it is 8 times more likely that the observed draw came from Deck A.
