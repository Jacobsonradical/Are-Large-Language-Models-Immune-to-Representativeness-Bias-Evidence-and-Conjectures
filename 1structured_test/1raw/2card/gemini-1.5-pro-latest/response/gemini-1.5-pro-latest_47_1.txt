Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Odds**

The decks were chosen randomly, so the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):**  Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A 
   *  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substituting our values:

[(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed data.
