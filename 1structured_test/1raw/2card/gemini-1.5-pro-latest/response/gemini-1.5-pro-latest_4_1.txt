Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The prior odds are the odds of selecting Deck A compared to Deck B before any cards are drawn. Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 X's, 1 O) given Deck A:** 
   (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

* **Likelihood ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

1 * 4 = 4

**Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.**

**{odds: 4}**
