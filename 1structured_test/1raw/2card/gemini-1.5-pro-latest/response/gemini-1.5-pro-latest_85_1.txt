Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|D), the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed draw.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)

Similarly,

P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

To get the posterior odds, we take the ratio:

[P(A|D)] / [P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Notice that P(D) cancels out in the odds calculation.  Substituting in our values:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's 4 times more likely that the observed draw came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
