Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have an equal chance of selecting either deck initially)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Since we only need the ratio, P(D) cancels out:

Posterior Odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Posterior Odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
              = 8 

**Answer**

{odds: 8}

This means the odds are 8:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
