Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The probability of choosing either deck is equal (1/2).  
* So the prior odds are 1:1 

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 X's, 1 O) given Deck A:**
   *  (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   *  (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
* Posterior Odds = (1/1) * 4 = 4:1

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
