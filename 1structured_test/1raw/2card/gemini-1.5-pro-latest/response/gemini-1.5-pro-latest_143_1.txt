Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Odds**

Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 
* Prior Odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):** Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A 
   * This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
   *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4
* [P(A) / P(B)] = 1 (prior odds)

Therefore, the posterior odds are: 4 * 1 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X cards.
