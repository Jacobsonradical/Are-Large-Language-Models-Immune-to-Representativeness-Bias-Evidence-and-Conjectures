Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Odds**

Since the deck was chosen randomly, the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Therefore, the prior odds of A to B are:

* Odds(A:B) = P(A) / P(B) = 1

**3. Likelihoods**

* **Likelihood of D given A (P(D|A)):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.  This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula: 
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **Likelihood of D given B (P(D|B)):**  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4.  Posterior Odds**

We use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

* Odds(A:B | D) = Odds(A:B) * [P(D|A) / P(D|B)]
* Odds(A:B | D) = 1 * [(32/81) / (8/81)]
* Odds(A:B | D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4, meaning it's 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.
