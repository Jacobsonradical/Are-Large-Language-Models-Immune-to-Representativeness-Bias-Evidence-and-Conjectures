Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. State Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Calculate Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate**

* P(D|A) = 8/81
* P(D|B) = 2/81

Substituting into Bayes' Theorem:

[(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
