Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let E be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We choose a deck at random, so the prior probability of each deck is equal)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A given the observed outcome.
