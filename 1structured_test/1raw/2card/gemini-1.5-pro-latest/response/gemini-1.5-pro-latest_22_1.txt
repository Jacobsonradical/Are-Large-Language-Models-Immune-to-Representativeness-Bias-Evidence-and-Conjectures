Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Prior Odds**

* The decks were selected by chance, meaning the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal: 1:1

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 Xs, 1 O) given Deck A:**  
   (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
