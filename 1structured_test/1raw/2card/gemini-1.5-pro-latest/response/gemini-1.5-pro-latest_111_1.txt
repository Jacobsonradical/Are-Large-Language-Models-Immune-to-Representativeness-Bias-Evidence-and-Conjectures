Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let `A` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let `B` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let `D` be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X, 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* `P(A) = 1/2` (We choose a deck at random, so each deck has an equal prior probability).
* `P(B) = 1/2` 

**3. Likelihoods**

* `P(D|A)` = Probability of observing the data given Deck A was chosen.  This is calculated using the binomial probability formula:
   *  `P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81` 
* `P(D|B)` = Probability of observing the data given Deck B was chosen:
   * `P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81`

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

`Posterior Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)`

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can rewrite each posterior probability:

* `P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)`
* `P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)`

When we take the ratio of these, the `P(D)` terms cancel out:

`Posterior Odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]`

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we calculated:

`Posterior Odds = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 4`

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

**Interpretation**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means that, given the observed data, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B.
