Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

The prior odds represent the odds of selecting each deck before any cards are drawn. Since the deck is selected by chance, the prior odds are 1:1, meaning both decks are equally likely.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

This measures how much more likely the observed evidence (3 Xs and 1 O) is under each deck scenario:

* **Likelihood of observing the evidence given Deck A:**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the evidence given Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

The likelihood ratio is (8/81) / (2/81) = 4. This means the observed evidence is 4 times more likely if the cards were drawn from Deck A.

**3. Posterior Odds**

To calculate the posterior odds, we multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:

Prior odds (1:1) * Likelihood ratio (4) =  4:1

**Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1. **

**{odds: 4}**
