Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. State the Prior Odds**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Therefore, the prior odds of A to B are:

*  P(A) / P(B) = 1

**3. Calculate the Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck A.
   * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * (4!/(3!1!)) = 32/81 
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from Deck B.
   * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (4!/(3!1!)) = 8/81

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs given new evidence:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

To find the posterior odds, we can take the ratio of these:

* [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), these terms cancel out, leaving:

* [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

**5. Calculate the Posterior Odds**

Substitute the likelihoods we calculated:

* [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
