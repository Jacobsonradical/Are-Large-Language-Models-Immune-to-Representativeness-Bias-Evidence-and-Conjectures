Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. State the Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We chose a deck at random, so each deck was equally likely)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Calculate the Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)] 
                 = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8}

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means that after observing the 4 drawn cards, it's 8 times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (the deck with mostly 'X' cards) compared to Deck B.
