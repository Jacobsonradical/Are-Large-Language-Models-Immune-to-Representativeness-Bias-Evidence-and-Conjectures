Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem (for odds)**

Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio * Prior odds

* Likelihood ratio = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = 8
* Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1

**5. Calculation**

Posterior odds = 8 * 1 = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

This means the odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A are 8 times greater than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, given the observed data.
