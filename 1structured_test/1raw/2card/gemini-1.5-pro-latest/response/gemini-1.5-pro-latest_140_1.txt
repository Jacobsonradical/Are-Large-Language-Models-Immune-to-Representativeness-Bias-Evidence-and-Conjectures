Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're using Bayesian reasoning. We know:

* **Prior odds:** The initial odds of selecting either deck were equal (1:1) since the deck was chosen randomly.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card depending on which deck we're considering.
* **Goal:** We want the posterior odds â€“ the updated odds of having chosen each deck *given* the observed cards.

**Calculations**

1. **Likelihood of the draw from Deck A (mostly X's):**
   * Probability of X from Deck A: 2/3
   * Probability of O from Deck A: 1/3
   * Likelihood of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

2. **Likelihood of the draw from Deck B (mostly O's):**
   * Probability of X from Deck B: 1/3
   * Probability of O from Deck B: 2/3
   * Likelihood of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

3. **Calculate the posterior odds:**

   * The posterior odds are found by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio.
   * Prior odds of Deck A to Deck B: 1:1 (or simply 1)
   * Likelihood ratio (Deck A to Deck B): (8/81) / (2/81) = 4 
   * Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the four cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
