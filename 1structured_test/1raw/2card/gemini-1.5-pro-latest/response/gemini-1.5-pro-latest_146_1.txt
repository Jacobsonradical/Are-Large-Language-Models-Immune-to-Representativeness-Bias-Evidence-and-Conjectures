Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let `A` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let `B` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let `D` be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* `P(A) = 1/2` (We have no reason to believe one deck was more likely to be chosen than the other).
* `P(B) = 1/2`

**3. Likelihoods**

* `P(D|A)` = Probability of observing the data given Deck A was chosen. This is calculated using the binomial probability: 
   * `P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81` 
* `P(D|B)` = Probability of observing the data given Deck B was chosen:
   * `P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81`

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

`P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]`

**5. Calculate**

Substitute the values we calculated:

`P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 4`

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
