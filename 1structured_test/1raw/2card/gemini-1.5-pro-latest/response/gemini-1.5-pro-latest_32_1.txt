Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the observed data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We chose the deck randomly, so the prior probability of each deck is equal).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹  (Probability of getting our observed data given we are drawing from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹  (Probability of getting our observed data given we are drawing from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the probabilities we calculated:

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ * (1/2)] / [(1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (2/27) 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
