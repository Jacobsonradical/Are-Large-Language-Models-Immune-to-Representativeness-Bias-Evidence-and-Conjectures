Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We chose the deck at random, so there's an equal chance of choosing A or B).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

```
Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) 
```

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can express this as:

```
Odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
```

**5. Calculation**

Substituting the values we have:

```
Odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
Odds = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(1/27) * (1/2)]
Odds = 8
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

This means that the odds are 8:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
