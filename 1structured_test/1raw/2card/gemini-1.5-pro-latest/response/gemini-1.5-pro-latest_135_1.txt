Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Prior Odds**

* The decks were selected by chance, so the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal: 1:1

**2. Likelihood Ratios**

* **Deck A:** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means that after observing the drawn cards, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (where X's are more common) than from Deck B.
