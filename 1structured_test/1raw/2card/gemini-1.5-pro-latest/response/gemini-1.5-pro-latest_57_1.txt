Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 Xs, 1 O) given Deck A:**  
   (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

**2. Prior Odds:**

The prior odds are 1:1 since the deck was selected by chance (meaning each deck had a probability of 1/2).

**3.  Calculating the Posterior Odds:**

* **Multiply the likelihood ratios by the prior odds:** 
   (8/81) / (2/81)  = 4:1

* **Simplify:** This simplifies to 4. 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the four cards being drawn from Deck A.
