Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Odds**

Since the decks were selected by chance, the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing the data given Deck A.  Since 2/3 of Deck A is marked X, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing the data given Deck B. Since 1/3 of Deck B is marked X: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**4.  Bayes' Theorem**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we calculated:

[(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
