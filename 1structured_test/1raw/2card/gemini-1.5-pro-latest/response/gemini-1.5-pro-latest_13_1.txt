Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of getting our data given Deck A was chosen)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of getting our data given Deck B was chosen)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate**

* P(D|A) = 8/81
* P(D|B) = 2/81
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
