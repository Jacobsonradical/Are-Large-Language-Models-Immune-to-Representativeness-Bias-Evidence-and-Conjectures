Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Odds**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):** Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A 
   * = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) * 4C1  (The 4C1 accounts for the different orderings)
   * = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B
   * = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) * 4C1
   * = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
