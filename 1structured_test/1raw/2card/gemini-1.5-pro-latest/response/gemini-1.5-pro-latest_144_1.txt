Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2.  Prior Odds**

The decks were chosen randomly, so the prior odds are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of observing the data given Deck A. This is calculated using the binomial probability formula: 
   * (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81 
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing the data given Deck B:
   * (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), the equation simplifies to:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the likelihoods we calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4}

**Interpretation**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (where most cards are X) than from Deck B.
