Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Odds**

The decks were chosen randomly, so the prior odds are equal:

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data given each deck:

* **P(D|A):** Probability of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A 
   *  (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
   * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

**4. Posterior Odds**

We use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

```
Odds(A|D) =  [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)] 
```

* Odds(A|D) = (8/81 / 2/81) * (1/2 / 1/2) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X.
