Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We chose the deck randomly)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (2/27)
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A given the observed draws.
