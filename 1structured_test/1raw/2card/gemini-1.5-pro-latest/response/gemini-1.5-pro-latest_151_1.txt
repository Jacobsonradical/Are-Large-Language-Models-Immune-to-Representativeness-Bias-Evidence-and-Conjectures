Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Prior Odds**

* The prior odds are 1:1 since there's an equal chance of selecting either deck A or deck B.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Likelihood of observing the data (3 Xs and 1 O) given Deck A:** 
   * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:**
   * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * Likelihood Ratio**
* Posterior Odds = 1 * 4 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means the odds are 4:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
