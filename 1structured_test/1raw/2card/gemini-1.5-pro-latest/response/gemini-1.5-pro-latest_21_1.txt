Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We chose the deck randomly, so the prior probabilities are equal)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of getting our data given Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of getting our data given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed using Bayes' Theorem as:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate**

Substitute the values we have:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed cards came from Deck A compared to Deck B.
