Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X, 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly selected one of the two decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values from steps 2 and 3 into Bayes' Theorem:

* [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)] 
* = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(1/27) * (1/2)]
* = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

The posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's 8 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.
