Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly chose one of the two decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) and P(B|D):

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we calculated:

[(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means it's 4 times more likely the cards came from Deck A given the observed outcome.
