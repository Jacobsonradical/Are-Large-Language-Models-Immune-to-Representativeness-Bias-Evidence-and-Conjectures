Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We have no information to suggest one deck is more likely than the other initially).
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Calculate Posterior Odds using Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds are given by:

```
Odds(A|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
```

Since P(A) = P(B), the formula simplifies to:

```
Odds(A|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)
```

**5. Substitute and Calculate**

```
Odds(A|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1] 
          = (8/27) / (2/27)
          = 4
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the observed data came from Deck A than from Deck B.
