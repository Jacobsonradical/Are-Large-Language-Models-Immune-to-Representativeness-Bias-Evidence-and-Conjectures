Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let D be the event of observing the data (3 Xs and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly chose one of the two decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem (for odds)**

Posterior odds are calculated as:

```
Odds(A|D) =  [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

* **Likelihood Ratio:** [P(D|A) / P(D|B)] = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = 8 
* **Prior Odds:** [P(A) / P(B)] = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1
* **Posterior Odds:** Odds(A|D) = 8 * 1 = 8

**Answer:**

{odds: 8} 

The posterior odds are 8:1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's 8 times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
