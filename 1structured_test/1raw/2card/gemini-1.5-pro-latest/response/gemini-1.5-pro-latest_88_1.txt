Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since one of the decks was chosen at random, we have:

* P(A) = 1/2  (Prior probability of choosing Deck A)
* P(B) = 1/2  (Prior probability of choosing Deck B)

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):** Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck A 
   * This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of drawing 3 'X' and 1 'O' from Deck B
   * Similarly: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

* P(A|D): Probability the cards came from Deck A given the observed data.
* P(B|D): Probability the cards came from Deck B given the observed data.

Bayes' Theorem gives us:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

To find the posterior odds, we can take the ratio of these:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substituting our calculated values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4, meaning it's 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.
