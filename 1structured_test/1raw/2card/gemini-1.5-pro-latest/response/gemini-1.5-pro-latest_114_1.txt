Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let `A` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let `B` be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let `D` be the event of observing the data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* `P(A) = 1/2` (We have no information to suggest one deck is more likely to have been chosen than the other).
* `P(B) = 1/2` 

**3. Likelihoods**

* `P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1`  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck A)
* `P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1`  (Probability of drawing 3 'X's and 1 'O' from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which can be expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities:

`P(A|D) / P(B|D)`

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can write this as:

`[P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]`

**5. Calculation**

Substituting our values:

`[(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (1/2)]`

Simplifying:

`(8/27) / (2/27) = 4`

**6. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds are **4:1** in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
