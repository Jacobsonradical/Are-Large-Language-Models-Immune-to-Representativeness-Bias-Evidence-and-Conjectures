Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1.  Prior Odds**

* The probability of selecting either deck is equal, so the prior odds are 1:1.

**2. Likelihood Ratio**

* **Deck A:**  The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
* **Deck B:** The probability of drawing 3 'X' cards and 1 'O' card from deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
* **Likelihood Ratio:** (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**3. Posterior Odds**

* Multiply the prior odds by the likelihood ratio: (1/1) * 4 = 4/1 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A given the observed draws.
