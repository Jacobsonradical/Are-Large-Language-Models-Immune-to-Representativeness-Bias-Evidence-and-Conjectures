Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
* Let "B" be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
* Let "D" be the event of observing the data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (We randomly selected one of the decks)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1  (Probability of getting 3 'X's and 1 'O' given Deck B)

**4. Calculate Posterior Odds**

We want to find the odds in favor of A, given the data: P(A|D) / P(B|D). We can use Bayes' Theorem and the fact that P(A|D) + P(B|D) = 1:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

**5. Substitute and Calculate**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (2/27) 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X. This means it's four times more likely the cards came from Deck A than Deck B, given the observed data.
