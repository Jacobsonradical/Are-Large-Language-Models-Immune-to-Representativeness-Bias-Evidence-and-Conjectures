Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * C(n/3, 1) * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * C(2n/3, 1) * (2/3)^1

The posterior odds are then the ratio of these probabilities:

Odds(A:B) = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Since we don't have the exact number of cards in each deck (n), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the odds in terms of n and the combinations:

odds: C(2n/3, 3) * (2/1)^3 * C(n/3, 1) / C(n/3, 3) * (1/2)^3 * C(2n/3, 1)
