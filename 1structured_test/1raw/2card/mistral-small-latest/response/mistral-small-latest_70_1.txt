Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the deck is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck is Deck A. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|E)/P(B|E), where E is the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since the deck was chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing the evidence E given that we have Deck A is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, which is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

The probability of drawing the evidence E given that we have Deck B is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The total probability of drawing E is P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B) = (0.5 * 8/81) + (0.5 * 2/27) = 1/9.

So, the posterior odds are:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B)) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 28/9.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 28/9}
