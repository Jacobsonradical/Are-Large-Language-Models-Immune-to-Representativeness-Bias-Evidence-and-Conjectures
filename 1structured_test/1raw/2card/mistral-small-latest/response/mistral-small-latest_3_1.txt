Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds:

1. Define prior odds: P(A)/P(B) = 1 (since we have no reason to favor one deck over the other, we assume they are equally likely)
2. Define likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
3. Define likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27
4. Calculate posterior odds: (likelihood of A * prior odds) / (likelihood of B) = (8/27 * 1) / (2/27) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are {odds: 4}.
