Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B. Let D be the event that the 4 cards drawn contain 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D) = [P(D|A)P(A)]/[P(D|B)P(B)]

Since we have no reason to believe either deck is more likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

Now let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

Posterior odds = [(8/27)*0.5] / [(2/243)*0.5] = (8/27) / (2/243) = 4056/4 = 1014

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 1014 to 1.

Final answer: {odds: 1014}
