To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). We are looking for the posterior odds P(A|data)/P(B|data).

First, let's assume that both decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|data) and P(B|data):

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
          = (8/27) * 0.5 / ((8/27) * 0.5 + (2/27) * 0.5)
          = 4/5

P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)
          = (2/27) * 0.5 / ((8/27) * 0.5 + (2/27) * 0.5)
          = 1/5

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data)
               = 4/5 / 1/5
               = 4

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
