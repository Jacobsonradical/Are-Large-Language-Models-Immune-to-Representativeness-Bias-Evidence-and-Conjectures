To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from Deck A as P(A), and the probability of drawing them from Deck B as P(B). We want to find the ratio P(A)/P(B), given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O.

The likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and the likelihood given Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, since we chose the deck at random.

Therefore, the posterior odds are the ratio of the likelihoods:

(2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/1 = {odds: 8}
