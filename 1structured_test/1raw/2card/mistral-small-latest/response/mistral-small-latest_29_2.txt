To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let E be the evidence that we drew 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find the posterior odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (since we're drawing from Deck A and the probabilities of drawing an X or O are 2/3 and 1/3 respectively)
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (since we're drawing from Deck B and the probabilities of drawing an X or O are 1/3 and 2/3 respectively)

Assuming that the probability of drawing from Deck A or Deck B is equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|E) and P(B|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since P(A) = P(B), we can cancel them out and get:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = P(E|A) / P(E|B) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1]

Calculating this gives approximately 64.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 64}
