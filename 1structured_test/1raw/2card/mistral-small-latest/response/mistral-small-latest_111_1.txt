{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

1. Let P(A) be the prior probability of choosing Deck A, and P(B) be the prior probability of choosing Deck B. Since the deck is chosen at random, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
2. Let E be the evidence that we drew 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.
3. We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of choosing Deck A given the evidence.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E). Similarly, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E).
5. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
6. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
7. Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:
   Posterior odds = (P(A|E) / P(A)) / (P(B|E) / P(B)) = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 8.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 8 to 1 compared to Deck B.
