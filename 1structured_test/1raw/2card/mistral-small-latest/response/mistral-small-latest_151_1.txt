To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B as the event that they were drawn from Deck B. We're looking for the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since we selected one of the decks by chance, the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2.

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

(P(A) * P(drawing 3Xs, 1O | A)) / (P(B) * P(drawing 3Xs, 1O | B)) = (1/2 * 8/27) / (1/2 * 2/27) = 4.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
