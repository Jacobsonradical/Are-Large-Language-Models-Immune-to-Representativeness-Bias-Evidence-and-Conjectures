Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. Let D be the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
and P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we're only interested in the ratio of these probabilities, we can eliminate P(D) from the equation:

Posterior Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since the decks were chosen at random, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27

Similarly, P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

Posterior Odds = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
