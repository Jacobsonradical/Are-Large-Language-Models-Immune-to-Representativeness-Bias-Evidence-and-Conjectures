Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data).

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

So, the posterior odds are:
P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|B) * P(B))

Assuming that Deck A and Deck B are equally likely, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Substituting the probabilities, we get:
(8/81 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4/1

So the answer is:
{odds: 4}
