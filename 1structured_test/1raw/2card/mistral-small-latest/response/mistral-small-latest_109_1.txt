To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, the exact number of cards in each deck is not provided. So, let's denote the total number of cards in each deck as N_A and N_B.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

The prior odds, assuming an equal probability of selecting either deck, is 1.

So, the posterior odds is the likelihood ratio times the prior odds, which is [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)] * 1 = 8.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
