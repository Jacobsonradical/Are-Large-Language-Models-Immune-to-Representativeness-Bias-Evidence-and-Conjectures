{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
2. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
4. The prior odds are 1:1 since both decks were equally likely to be chosen.
5. So, the posterior odds are (8/27) / (2/27) = 8:1, or just 8 when expressed as a single number.
