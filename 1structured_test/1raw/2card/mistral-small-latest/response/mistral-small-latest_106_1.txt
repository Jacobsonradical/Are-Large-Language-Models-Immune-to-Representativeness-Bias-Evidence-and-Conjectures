To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
X: Three of the four cards drawn are marked X and one is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Now, we need to find these probabilities:
- P(A) and P(B): Since the deck was chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5
- P(X|A): The probability of drawing three X cards and one O card from Deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula, which gives (2/3)^3 * (1/3) ≈ 0.222
- P(X|B): Similarly, the probability of drawing three X cards and one O card from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) ≈ 0.022
- P(X): This is the total probability of drawing three X cards and one O card from either deck. Using the law of total probability, P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) ≈ 0.122

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)] / [P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)]
= [(0.222 * 0.5) / 0.122] / [(0.022 * 0.5) / 0.122]
= 5.04

So, the answer is:
{odds: 5.04}
