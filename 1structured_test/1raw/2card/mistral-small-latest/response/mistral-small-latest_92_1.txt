To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We are given that 3 cards were marked X and 1 card was marked O.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 10/81

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 1/81

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]

Assuming that both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), the posterior odds become:
Posterior odds = (10/81 * 0.5) / (1/81 * 0.5) = 10

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 10:1.

Final answer: {odds: 10}
