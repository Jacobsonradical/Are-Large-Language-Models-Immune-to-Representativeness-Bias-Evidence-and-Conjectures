To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the deck is Deck A, and B as the event that the deck is Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since we don't have any prior information about which deck is more likely, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

So, the posterior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = [P(A) * Likelihood of data given A] / [P(B) * Likelihood of data given B]
= [0.5 * 8/27] / [0.5 * 2/27]
= 4

So, the answer is {odds: 4}.
