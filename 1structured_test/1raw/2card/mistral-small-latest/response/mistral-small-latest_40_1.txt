To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

The prior odds, assuming an equal chance of selecting either deck, is 1.

So, the posterior odds = likelihood of data given A / likelihood of data given B * prior odds
= [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
= 8

So, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
