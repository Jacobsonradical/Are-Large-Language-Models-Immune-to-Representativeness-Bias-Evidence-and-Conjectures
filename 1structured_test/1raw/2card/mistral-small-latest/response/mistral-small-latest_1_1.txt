To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We are given that 3 cards out of 4 drawn are marked X, which we denote as D.

We need to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we have no reason to believe one deck was selected over the other, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.

Similarly, P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27.

The probability of the evidence P(D) can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(D|A) and P(D|B): P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) = (10/27) * 0.5 = 5/27.

Now, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)) / (P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B)) = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
