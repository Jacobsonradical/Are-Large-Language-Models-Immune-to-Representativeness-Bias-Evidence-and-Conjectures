The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 8.

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.
2. Let A be the event of drawing from Deck A and B be the event of drawing from Deck B.
3. Let X be the evidence of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.
4. We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X).
5. P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A).
6. P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B).
7. The prior odds, P(A)/P(B), are assumed to be equal since the decks were chosen by chance, so P(A)/P(B) = 1.
8. Using Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) / P(X|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)] = (8/27) / (2/27) * 1 = 8.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is 8 times the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
