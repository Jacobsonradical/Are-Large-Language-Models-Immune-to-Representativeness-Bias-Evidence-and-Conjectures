To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing the cards from deck B as P(B). We're asked to find P(A)/P(B), the posterior odds.

First, let's find the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from each deck. Using the binomial probability formula:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A) and P(B):

P(A) = P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A prior) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A prior) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B prior)]
P(B) = P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B prior) / [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A prior) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B prior)]

Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A prior) = P(B prior) = 0.5.

Substituting these values into the expression for posterior odds, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A) / P(B) = [P(3X, 1O | A) * 0.5] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * 0.5] = P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)

Calculating the probabilities and substituting them into the above equation, we get:

Posterior odds ≈ 20 / 2 ≈ 10

So, the final answer is:
{odds: 10}
