To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing a card from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen by chance).

We are also given the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck. From Deck A, the probability is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/243. From Deck B, the probability is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

The posterior odds of A vs B are given by P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)].

Substituting the values, we get (8/243 * 0.5) / (2/243 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
