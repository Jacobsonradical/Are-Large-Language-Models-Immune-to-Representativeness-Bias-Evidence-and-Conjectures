Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B. Let D be the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O in the drawn cards.

We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D) = [P(D|A)P(A)] / [P(D|B)P(B)]

Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: (0.5 * 4/27) / (0.5 * 4/81) = 81/27 = 3}

Therefore, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3:1.
