Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem:

1. Let A be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
2. We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), where D is the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D), and similarly for P(B|D).
4. P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of drawing from each deck, assuming they are equally likely, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
5. P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
6. P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
7. P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) = (8/27)*(1/2) + (2/27)*(1/2) = 5/27.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] = [(8/27)*(1/2)] / [(2/27)*(1/2)] = 4.

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
