The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the deck is Deck A and B as the event that the deck is Deck B. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the deck is A (P(3X, 1O|A)) is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that the deck is B (P(3X, 1O|B)) is (1/3)^3 * (2/3). The prior probability of selecting Deck A and Deck B is assumed to be equal (0.5 each).

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O), which simplifies to the ratio of the likelihoods times the prior odds.

So, the posterior odds are (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 8}
