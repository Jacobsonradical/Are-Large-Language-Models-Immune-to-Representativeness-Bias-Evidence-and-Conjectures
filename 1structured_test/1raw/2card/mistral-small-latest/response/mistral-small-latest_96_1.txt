Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem:

1. Let's denote the probability of selecting Deck A as P(A) and Deck B as P(B). Since the deck is chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

2. Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed data (3X and 1O) given that Deck A was selected as P(D|A). Similarly, let P(D|B) be the probability of drawing the observed data given that Deck B was selected.

3. P(D|A) = C(32, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (since there are 32 cards in Deck A and we're drawing 4)
   P(D|B) = C(32, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (since there are 32 cards in Deck B and we're drawing 4)

4. The posterior odds are given by the formula: P(A|D)/P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

5. Plugging in the values, we get: (0.5 * P(D|A)) / (0.5 * P(D|B)) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

6. Calculating the ratio of P(D|A) and P(D|B), we get the posterior odds as approximately 64.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 64}
