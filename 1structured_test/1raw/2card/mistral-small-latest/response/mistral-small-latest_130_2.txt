To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the deck is Deck A and B as the event that the deck is Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Assuming equal prior probabilities for both decks, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data) = (8/27) * 0.5 / ((8/27)*0.5 + (2/27)*0.5) = 4/5
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data) = (2/27) * 0.5 / ((8/27)*0.5 + (2/27)*0.5) = 1/5

So, the posterior odds are P(A|data) / P(B|data) = 4/1 = 4.

Therefore, the answer is {odds: 4}.
