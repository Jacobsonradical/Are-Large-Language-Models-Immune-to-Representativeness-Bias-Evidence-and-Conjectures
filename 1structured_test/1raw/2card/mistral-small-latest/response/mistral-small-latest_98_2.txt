To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing them from deck B as P(B). We are given that one deck was chosen at random, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Let's denote the evidence (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) as E. We want to find P(A|E)/P(B|E), the posterior odds.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. This can be calculated as the binomial probability: C(4,3)*(2/3)^3*(1/3)^1 = 4/27.

Similarly, P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B. This can be calculated as: C(4,3)*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^1 = 4/81.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A)*P(A)]/[P(E|B)*P(B)].

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = [(4/27)*0.5] / [(4/81)*0.5] = 9/2.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 9/2}
