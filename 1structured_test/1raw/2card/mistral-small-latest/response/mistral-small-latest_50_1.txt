To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they are drawn from Deck B as B.

We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where "data" is the observed data (3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O).

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2 because we have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other.

So, the posterior odds are:

(P(data|A) * P(A)) / (P(data|B) * P(B)) = (8/27 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = 4

So, the answer is {odds: 4}.
