To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B. We are given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The probability of drawing such a combination from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing such a combination from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The prior probability of drawing from either deck is 0.5 (since we assume equal chance of selecting either deck).

Therefore, the posterior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of this combination occurring given each deck:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)] = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4/1.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
