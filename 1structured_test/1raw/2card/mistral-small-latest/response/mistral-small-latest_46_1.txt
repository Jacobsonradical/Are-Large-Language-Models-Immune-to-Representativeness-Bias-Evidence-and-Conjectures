To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A and the event of drawing the cards from Deck B as B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen at random).

We need to find the likelihood P(drawing 3X and 1O | A) and P(drawing 3X and 1O | B).

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3 and an O is 1/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3 and an O is 2/3. So, the likelihood of drawing 3X and 1O is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

Bayes' theorem gives us P(A|drawing 3X and 1O) / P(B|drawing 3X and 1O) = [P(drawing 3X and 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(drawing 3X and 1O | B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values, we get the posterior odds = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/243 * 0.5) = 484/3 = {odds: 161.33} (approximately)
