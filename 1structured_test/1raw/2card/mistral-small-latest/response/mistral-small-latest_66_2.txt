To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, we don't have the prior probabilities for the decks. Let's assume that the prior probabilities for both decks are equal, i.e., 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated as follows:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated as follows:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The posterior odds are then the ratio of these probabilities multiplied by the prior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)) * Prior odds
               = (8/27 / 2/27) * (0.5/0.5)
               = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
