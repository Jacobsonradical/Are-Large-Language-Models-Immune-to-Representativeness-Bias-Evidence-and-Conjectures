Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate this.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where "data" is the information that 3 cards were marked X and 1 card was marked O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since we don't know the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, let's assume they are equal (this is known as a "non-informative prior").

So, P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)] = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is {odds: 4}.
