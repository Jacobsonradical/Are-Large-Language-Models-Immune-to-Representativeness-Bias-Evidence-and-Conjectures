Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since we don't have any prior information about the selection of the decks, we can assume they are equally likely, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The posterior odds are then:

P(A)/P(B) = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]
= (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5)
= 4/1

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
