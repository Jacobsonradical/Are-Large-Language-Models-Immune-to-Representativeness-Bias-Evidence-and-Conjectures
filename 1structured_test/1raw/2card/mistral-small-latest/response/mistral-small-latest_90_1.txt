To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 20/81

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 1/81

Since we don't know the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A or Deck B, we'll assume they are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
               = [P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B)]
               = (20/81 * 0.5) / (1/81 * 0.5)
               = 20

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 20.

Answer: {odds: 20}
