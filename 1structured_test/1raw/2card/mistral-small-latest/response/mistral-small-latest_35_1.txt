To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27

Since the decks were chosen randomly, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = [P(A) * P(data | A)] / [P(B) * P(data | B)]
               = [0.5 * 8/27] / [0.5 * 2/27]
               = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
