To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the deck is deck A
- B: the event that the deck is deck B
- X: the event that 3 out of 4 drawn cards are marked X and 1 is marked O

We want to find P(A|X)/P(B|X).

We know that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since one deck was selected by chance).

Now, let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B).

In deck A, the probability of drawing a card marked X is 2/3, so the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws is:
P(X|A) = C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1, where n is the total number of cards in deck A.

In deck B, the probability of drawing a card marked X is 1/3, so the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 draws is:
P(X|B) = C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1, where n is the total number of cards in deck B.

Assuming both decks have the same total number of cards (n), we can cancel out the common terms in the binomial coefficients and simplify the expression for the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X)/P(B|X) = [P(X|A) / P(X|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)]
                                 = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)] * 1
                                 = 8

So, the answer is {odds: 8}.
