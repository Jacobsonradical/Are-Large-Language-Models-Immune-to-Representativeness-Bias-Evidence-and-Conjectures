Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event of selecting Deck A and B be the event of selecting Deck B. Let X be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since one deck was selected at random). We also need to compute the likelihood P(X|A) and P(X|B).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
               = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5)
               = 4

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
