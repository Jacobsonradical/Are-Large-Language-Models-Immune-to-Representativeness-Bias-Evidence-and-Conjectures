Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then find the ratio of these probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   P(Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, let's find the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = P(Deck A) / P(Deck B) = (8/81) / (2/243) = 484/16

So, {odds: 484/16}
