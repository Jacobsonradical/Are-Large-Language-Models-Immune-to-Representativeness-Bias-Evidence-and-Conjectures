{odds: 8}

Explanation:
Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.

1. Let's define P(A) as the probability of selecting Deck A, and P(B) as the probability of selecting Deck B. Since both decks are chosen by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

2. Let's define L(X|A) as the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A, and L(X|B) as the likelihood of drawing the same cards from Deck B.

   L(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243
   L(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243

3. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds (1 in this case) multiplied by the likelihood ratio.

   Posterior odds = (P(A) / P(B)) * (L(X|A) / L(X|B)) = (1) * (8/243 / 2/243) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds are 8 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
