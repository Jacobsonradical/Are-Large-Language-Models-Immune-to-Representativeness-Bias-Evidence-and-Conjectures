{odds: 27}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
2. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
3. Let E be the evidence, which is drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.
4. We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), where P(A|E) is the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck A, and P(B|E) is the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck B.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E), and similarly for P(B|E).
6. P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2 since we assumed the deck was chosen at random.
7. P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
8. P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
9. P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B) = (1/2) * (8/27) + (1/2) * (2/27) = 5/27.
10. Therefore, the posterior odds are P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) * (1/2) / (2/27) * (1/2) = 27.
