The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 81.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds: (prior odds) * (likelihood of data given Deck A) / (likelihood of data given Deck B).
2. We don't have any prior information about the decks, so we'll assume equal prior probabilities (prior odds = 1).
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is the product of the probabilities of each draw: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
4. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
5. So, the posterior odds are: (1) * (8/27) / (2/27) = 8/2.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 81 (8 divided by 1/2).
