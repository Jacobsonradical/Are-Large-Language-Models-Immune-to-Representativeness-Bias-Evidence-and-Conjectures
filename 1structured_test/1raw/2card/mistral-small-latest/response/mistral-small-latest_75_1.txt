To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|X)/P(B|X), where X is the event that 3 out of 4 cards are marked X.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the deck was chosen randomly)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

P(A|X)/P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
= [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/27) * (1/2)]
= 8/2

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
