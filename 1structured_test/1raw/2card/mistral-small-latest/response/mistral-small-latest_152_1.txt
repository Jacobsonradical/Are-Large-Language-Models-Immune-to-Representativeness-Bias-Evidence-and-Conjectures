{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.
2. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
3. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).
4. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
5. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
6. Since we don't have any prior information about the selection of decks, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
7. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are: P(A)/P(B) = [P(A) * Likelihood(A)] / [P(B) * Likelihood(B)] = (1/2 * 8/27) / (1/2 * 2/27) = 8.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
