To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the posterior odds of drawing from deck A versus deck B, given that we've drawn 3 X's and 1 O.

Let's denote:
P(A) = Prior probability of drawing from deck A
P(B) = Prior probability of drawing from deck B (since we're choosing one at random, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5)
P(X|A) = Probability of drawing an X from deck A
P(O|A) = Probability of drawing an O from deck A
P(X|B) = Probability of drawing an X from deck B
P(O|B) = Probability of drawing an O from deck B

We're given that P(X|A) = 2/3 and P(O|A) = 1/3, and P(X|B) = 1/3 and P(O|B) = 2/3.

We want to find P(A|XXXO)/P(B|XXXO).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|XXXO) = P(XXXO|A) * P(A) / P(XXXO)
P(B|XXXO) = P(XXXO|B) * P(B) / P(XXXO)

So, the posterior odds are given by:
P(A|XXXO) / P(B|XXXO) = [P(XXXO|A) * P(A)] / [P(XXXO|B) * P(B)]

Given that we're drawing cards without replacement, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:
P(XXXO|A) = (2/3)*(2/2)*(2/1)*(1/2) = 4/9

And the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:
P(XXXO|B) = (1/3)*(1/2)*(2/3)*(2/2) = 2/27

Substituting these values and our prior probabilities into the formula for posterior odds, we get:

Posterior odds = [(4/9)*0.5] / [(2/27)*0.5] = 2

So, the answer is:
{odds: 2}
