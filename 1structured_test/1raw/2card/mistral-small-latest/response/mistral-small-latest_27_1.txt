It is a classic problem of Bayesian inference. Let's denote the probability of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A as P(D|A) and from Deck B as P(D|B).

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The prior probability of selecting each deck is assumed to be equal, so the prior odds are 1:1.

The posterior odds are given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) / P(D|B)) * Prior odds
               = (8/27) / (2/27) * 1
               = 4

Final answer:
{odds: 4}
