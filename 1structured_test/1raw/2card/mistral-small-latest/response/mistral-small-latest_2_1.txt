Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D), where D is the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since the decks were chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

So, the posterior odds are:

P(A|D)/P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
= [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(2/27) * (1/2)]
= 4/1

So, {odds: 4}
