To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the deck drawn is Deck A, and B as the event that the deck drawn is Deck B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen at random).

We need to find the likelihood P(data|A) and P(data|B), where the data is drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

For Deck A:
P(data|A) = P(3X and 1O|A) = C(2/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 10/81

For Deck B:
P(data|B) = P(3X and 1O|B) = C(1/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 1/81

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]
                               = (10/81 * 0.5) / (1/81 * 0.5)
                               = 10

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 10.

Answer: {odds: 10}
