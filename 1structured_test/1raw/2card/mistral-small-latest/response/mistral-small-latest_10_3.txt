Let's calculate the probability of drawing the observed outcome (3X and 1O) from each deck:

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2n/3, 3) * C(n/3, 1) / C(n, 4)

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(n/3, 3) * C(2n/3, 1) / C(n, 4)

To find the posterior odds, we take the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
                       = [C(2n/3, 3) * C(n/3, 1)] / [C(n/3, 3) * C(2n/3, 1)]

Since n (the total number of cards) is very large, we can approximate the combinations using the binomial probability formula:

Posterior odds â‰ˆ (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
                          = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.

Answer: {odds: 8}
