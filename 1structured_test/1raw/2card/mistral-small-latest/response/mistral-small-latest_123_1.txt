{odds: 8}

Explanation:
Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The likelihood ratio of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

LR = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8

By Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds (assumed to be 1 since we have no reason to favor one deck over the other) times the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR = 1 * 8 = 8
