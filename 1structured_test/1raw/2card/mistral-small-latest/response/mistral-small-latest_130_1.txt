{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where the data is the observation of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards.

First, let's find P(data|A) and P(data|B). In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X card is 2/3, and in Deck B, it's 1/3. So, P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 \* (1/3) and P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 \* (2/3).

Next, we need P(A) and P(B), the prior probabilities. Since the deck was chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior odds = [P(A) * P(data|A)] / [P(B) * P(data|B)]
               = [(1/2) * (8/27)] / [(1/2) * (2/27)]
               = 8

So, the posterior odds are 8 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
