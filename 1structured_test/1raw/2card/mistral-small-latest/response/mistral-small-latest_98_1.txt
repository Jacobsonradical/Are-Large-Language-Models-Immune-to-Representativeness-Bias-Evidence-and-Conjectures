The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B. We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D), where D is the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find P(D|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. This is given by the binomial probability:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we need the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A|D)/P(B|D)] = [P(D|A)*P(A)] / [P(D|B)*P(B)] = (8/27 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = 16/3

So, the answer is:
{odds: 16/3}
