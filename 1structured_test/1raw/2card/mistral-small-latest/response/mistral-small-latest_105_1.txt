To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as drawing the cards from deck A, and event B as drawing the cards from deck B. We are given that 4 cards are drawn, with 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), where D is the observed data.

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we don't know the prior probabilities of choosing deck A or deck B, we can assume they are equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B)). This assumption simplifies our calculation to finding the ratio of P(D|A) / P(D|B).

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A. This can be calculated as the combination of 3 X's in 4 draws and 1 O in 1 draw, given the probabilities in deck A:

P(D|A) = C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly,
P(D|B) = C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The ratio P(D|A) / P(D|B) is our answer. However, since the question asks for a single number, we can simply calculate this value. For large decks, we can approximate the binomial coefficients using the normal distribution. After calculation, the odds are approximately:

{odds: 18.0}
