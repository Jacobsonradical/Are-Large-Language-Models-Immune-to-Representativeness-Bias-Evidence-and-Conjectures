The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed data from deck A as P(D|A) and from deck B as P(D|B).

The odds of drawing the observed data from deck A compared to deck B is P(D|A) / P(D|B).

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4C3

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B is:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4C3

So, the posterior odds are:

{odds: (P(D|A) / P(D|B))}

Calculating the values:

(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4C3 / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4C3 = 8

So, the answer is {odds: 8}
