To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A and the event of drawing the cards from Deck B as B.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), where D is the evidence of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

We need prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), but since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

So, the posterior odds are:

(P(A|D) / P(B|D)) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B)) = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
