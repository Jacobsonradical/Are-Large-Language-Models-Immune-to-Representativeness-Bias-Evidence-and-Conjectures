First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * C(n/3, 1) * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * C(2n/3, 1) * (2/3)^1

Where n is the total number of cards in each deck (assumed to be the same for both decks), and C(a, b) is the combination of choosing b items from a set of size a.

The posterior odds are then the ratio of these probabilities:

Odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)

Since we don't have a specific value for n, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, the odds will be greater than 1, indicating that it's more likely the cards were drawn from Deck A.
