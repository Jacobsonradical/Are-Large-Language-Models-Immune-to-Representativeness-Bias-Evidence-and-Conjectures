{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A)/P(B).

Let L be the evidence that 3 cards were marked X and 1 card was marked O.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|L) / P(B|L) = [P(L|A) / P(L|B)] * [P(A) / P(B)].

Assuming both decks have the same number of cards and we have no prior information favoring one deck over the other, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so the prior odds are 1.

Now, we need to find the likelihood ratios P(L|A) / P(L|B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is: (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is: (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

So, P(L|A) / P(L|B) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4.

Multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio, we get the posterior odds: 1 * 4 = 4. However, the question asks for the odds of Deck A being selected compared to Deck B, so we invert the ratio to get 8.
