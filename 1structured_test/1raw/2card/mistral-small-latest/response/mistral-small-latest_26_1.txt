{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Assuming we have a large number of cards in each deck, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
(2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
(1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is the ratio of these probabilities:
(8/27) / (2/27) = 8/2 = 4

However, since we started with equal prior odds for both decks, the posterior odds is just the likelihood ratio, which is 8.
