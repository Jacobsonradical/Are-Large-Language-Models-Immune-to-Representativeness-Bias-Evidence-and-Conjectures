Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let E be the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find P(A|E)/P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since the deck was chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B) = (8/27 * 0.5) + (2/27 * 0.5) = 6/27

So, the posterior odds are:

Odds = P(A|E)/P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)] = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4

Answer:
{odds: 4}
