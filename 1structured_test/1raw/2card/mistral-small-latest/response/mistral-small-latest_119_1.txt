{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards and getting 3 X's and 1 O as E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (likelihood of E given deck A * prior odds) / (likelihood of E given deck B)

Assuming both decks have the same number of cards and we have no reason to believe one deck is more likely than the other, the prior odds are 1.

The likelihood of E given deck A is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, which is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

The likelihood of E given deck B is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

So, the posterior odds = (8/81 * 1) / (2/243) = 8.
