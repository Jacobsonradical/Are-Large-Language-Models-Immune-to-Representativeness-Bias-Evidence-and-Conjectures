The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 16.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let $A$ be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A and $B$ be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
2. Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find the posterior odds $\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}$, where $D$ is the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).
3. Compute the likelihood of observing the data given each deck:
   - $P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^3(\frac{1}{3})^1$ (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
   - $P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3}(\frac{1}{3})^3(\frac{2}{3})^1$ (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
4. Since we don't have any prior information about the probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B, we can assume an equal prior probability for both decks: $P(A) = P(B) = 0.5$.
5. Now, we can calculate the posterior odds: $\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{(\frac{2}{3})^3(\frac{1}{3})^1 \cdot 0.5}{(\frac{1}{3})^3(\frac{2}{3})^1 \cdot 0.5} = 16$.
