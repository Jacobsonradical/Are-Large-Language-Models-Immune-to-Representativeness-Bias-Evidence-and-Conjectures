To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the deck is A as D_A and the event that the deck is B as D_B. We are given that P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5 (since the deck was selected by chance). Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X and 1 O as E.

We need to find P(D_A|E) / P(D_B|E).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(D_A|E) = P(E|D_A) * P(D_A) / P(E).

P(E|D_A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution: C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27.

Similarly, P(E|D_B) = P(E|D_B) * P(D_B) / P(E) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81.

So, the posterior odds are P(D_A|E) / P(D_B|E) = (4/27) / (4/81) = 81/27 = 3.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 3}
