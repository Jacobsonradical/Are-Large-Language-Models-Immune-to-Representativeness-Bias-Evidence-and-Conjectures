To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:

P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is:

P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are equal to the prior odds (which we can assume to be 1 since we have no initial preference for either deck) times the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * [P(3X, 1O | A) / P(3X, 1O | B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

Posterior odds = 1 * [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) / (1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
                      = 8

So, the answer is {odds: 8}.
