Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let D be the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|D)/P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.2222

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0444

The denominator P(D) is equal to P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B), which simplifies to P(D|A) * 0.5 + P(D|B) * 0.5.

So, the posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * 0.5) / (P(D|B) * 0.5) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) ≈ 0.2222 / 0.0444 ≈ 5

So, the answer is:
{odds: 5}
