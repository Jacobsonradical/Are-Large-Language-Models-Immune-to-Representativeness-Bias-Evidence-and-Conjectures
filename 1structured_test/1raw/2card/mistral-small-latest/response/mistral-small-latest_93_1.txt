{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds.
2. The prior odds are 1:1, since both decks are equally likely to be chosen.
3. Let's calculate the likelihood ratio:
   - The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
   - The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
4. The likelihood ratio is then 8/27 : 2/27 = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1.
5. Multiply the likelihood ratio by the prior odds to get the posterior odds: 4 : 1 * 1 : 1 = 4 : 1.
