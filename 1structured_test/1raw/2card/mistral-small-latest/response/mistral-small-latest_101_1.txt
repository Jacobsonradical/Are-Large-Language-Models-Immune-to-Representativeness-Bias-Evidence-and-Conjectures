To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We are given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The probability of drawing this combination from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.

The probability of drawing this combination from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The posterior odds of A given the evidence is the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence) = [P(evidence|A) * P(A)] / [P(evidence|B) * P(B)]

Assuming we have no prior information about the selection of the deck, we can consider P(A) and P(B) as equal to 1/2.

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier into the formula, we get:

Posterior odds = (8/27 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
