The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed outcome given deck A as P(X|A) and similarly for deck B as P(X|B). The probability of drawing a deck is P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since it was chosen by chance.

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A, which can be calculated as (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
Similarly, P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The posterior odds are then:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)] = [(8/27) * 0.5] / [(2/27) * 0.5] = 4/1

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
