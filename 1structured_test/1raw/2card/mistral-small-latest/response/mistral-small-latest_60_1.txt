To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). We can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since one of the decks was chosen at random.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities P(A|data) and P(B|data), where data is the observed data, i.e., drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

The posterior odds can then be written as:

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), this simplifies to:

Posterior odds = P(data|A) / P(data|B)

The probability of drawing the data (3 X's and 1 O) from Deck A is:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of drawing the data from Deck B is:
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(data|A) / P(data|B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
