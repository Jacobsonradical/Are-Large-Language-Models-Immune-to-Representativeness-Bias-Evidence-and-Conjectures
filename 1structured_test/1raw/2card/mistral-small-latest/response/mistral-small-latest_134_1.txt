To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from deck A as P(A) and the probability of drawing the cards from deck B as P(B). We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of drawing the cards from each deck given the evidence, i.e., P(A|evidence)/P(B|evidence).

The evidence is that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Let's calculate P(evidence|A) and P(evidence|B), the probability of observing the evidence given that the cards were drawn from deck A and deck B respectively.

For deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X from deck A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O from deck A)
P(evidence|A) = P(X, X, X, O|A) = P(X|A)^3 * P(O|A) = (2/3)^3 * 1/3 ≈ 0.089

For deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X from deck B)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O from deck B)
P(evidence|B) = P(X, X, X, O|B) = P(X|B)^3 * P(O|B) = (1/3)^3 * 2/3 ≈ 0.022

Now, let's assume that the prior probabilities of drawing from deck A and deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The posterior odds are then:

Posterior odds = P(A|evidence) / P(B|evidence) = [P(evidence|A) * P(A)] / [P(evidence|B) * P(B)]
= (0.089 * 0.5) / (0.022 * 0.5) ≈ 4.05

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B, given the evidence, are approximately 4.05 to 1.

Answer: {odds: 4.05}
