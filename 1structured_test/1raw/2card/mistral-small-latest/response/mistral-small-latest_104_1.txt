Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The prior odds are 1:1 since both decks were equally likely to be chosen.

The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probabilities of the given data under each hypothesis:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * (Probability of data given Deck A) / (Probability of data given Deck B)
               = 1 * (8/27) / (2/27)
               = 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer:
{odds: 4}
