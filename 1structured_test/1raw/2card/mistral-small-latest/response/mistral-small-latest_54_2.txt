To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B as B. We are given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The likelihood of this outcome given that the cards were drawn from Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O | A) = C(2/3, 3) * (1/3)^1 = 20/81

The likelihood of this outcome given that the cards were drawn from Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O | B) = C(1/3, 3) * (2/3)^1 = 1/27

The prior odds (before drawing any cards) are equal since we are choosing a deck at random. So, let's denote the prior odds as 1:1.

Then, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = (Likelihood given A) / (Likelihood given B) * Prior odds
                      = (20/81) / (1/27) * 1
                      = 20/3

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 20:3.

Answer: {odds: 20/3}
