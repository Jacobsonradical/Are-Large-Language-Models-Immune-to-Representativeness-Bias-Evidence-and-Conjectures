Let's calculate the probabilities of drawing such a sequence of cards from each deck using the binomial distribution.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Now, we can find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
               = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
               = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
{odds: 8}
