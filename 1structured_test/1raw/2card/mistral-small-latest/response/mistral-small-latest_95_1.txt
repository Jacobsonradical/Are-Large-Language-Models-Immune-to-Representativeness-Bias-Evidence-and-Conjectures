To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B as B.

The posterior odds of A over B is given by the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1 (since both decks were chosen with equal probability)

Likelihood ratio = P(3X and 1O | A) / P(3X and 1O | B)

The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(3X and 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is:

P(3X and 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81

So, the likelihood ratio is (4/27) / (4/81) = 81/27 = 3

The posterior odds is then 1 (prior odds) * 3 (likelihood ratio) = 3

So, the answer is:
{odds: 3}
