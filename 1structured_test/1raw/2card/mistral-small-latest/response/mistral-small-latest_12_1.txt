To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We are given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The prior odds can be assumed to be 1:1 since both decks were chosen by chance.

So, the posterior odds are (likelihood of A given data) / (likelihood of B given data) = 8/27 : 2/27 = 4 : 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
