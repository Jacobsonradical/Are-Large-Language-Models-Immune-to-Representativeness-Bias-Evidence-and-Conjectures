{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's denote the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A as P(A), and the probability of drawing them from Deck B as P(B).
2. We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A) to P(B) given the observed data.
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.
4. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27.
5. Since the decks were chosen by chance, we can assume they were chosen with equal probability (0.5 for each deck).
6. Therefore, the posterior odds are the ratio of the likelihoods multiplied by the prior probabilities: (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 8.
