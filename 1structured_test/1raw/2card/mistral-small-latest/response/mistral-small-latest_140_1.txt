The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. Let D be the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), where P(A|D) is the probability of drawing the cards from Deck A given the evidence, and P(B|D) is the probability of drawing the cards from Deck B given the evidence.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
and P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the deck was chosen by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

The probability of the evidence given both hypotheses is P(D|A) = 8/81 and P(D|B) = 2/81

So, the posterior odds are P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B)) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
