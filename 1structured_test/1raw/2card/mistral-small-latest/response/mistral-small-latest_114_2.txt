The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 since the deck was selected by chance. The probability of drawing the observed outcome (3X, 1O) given A is (2/3)^3*(1/3), and given B is (1/3)^3*(2/3). So, the posterior odds are:

Odds(A|3X,1O) / Odds(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)
= [(2/3)^3*(1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3*(2/3) * 0.5]
= 8

So, the answer is {odds: 8}.
