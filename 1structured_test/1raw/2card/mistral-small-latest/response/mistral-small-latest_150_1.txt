Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem:

1. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
2. Let X be the event that we drew 3 marked X cards and 1 marked O card.
3. We want to find P(A|X)/P(B|X).
4. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X). Similarly, P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X).
5. Since the deck was chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
6. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243.
7. Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243.
8. P(X) = P(X|A)P(A) + P(X|B)P(B) = (0.5 * 8/243) + (0.5 * 2/243) = 5/243.
9. Therefore, the posterior odds are P(A|X)/P(B|X) = [P(X|A)P(A)] / [P(X|B)P(B)] = (8/243 * 0.5) / (2/243 * 0.5) = 4.

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 4}
