The probability of drawing such a sequence from deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
The probability of drawing such a sequence from deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

The odds of drawing from deck A compared to deck B is the ratio of these probabilities:

odds = (8/81) / (2/243) = 128/2 = 64

So, the answer is {odds: 64}.
