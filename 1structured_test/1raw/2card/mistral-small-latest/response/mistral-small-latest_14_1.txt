To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the cards from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B), which are both 0.5 since the deck was chosen at random. Let's denote the probability of observing the data (3 X and 1 O) given that the cards were drawn from Deck A as P(D|A) and from Deck B as P(D|B).

P(D|A) can be calculated as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A, which is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

P(D|B) can be calculated as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B, which is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

The posterior odds can then be calculated as the ratio of P(A|D) and P(B|D), which is equal to the ratio of P(D|A) and P(D|B) multiplied by the prior odds (which are 1 in this case since P(A) = P(B)):

Posterior odds = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (8/81) / (2/243) = 1216/2.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 1216}
