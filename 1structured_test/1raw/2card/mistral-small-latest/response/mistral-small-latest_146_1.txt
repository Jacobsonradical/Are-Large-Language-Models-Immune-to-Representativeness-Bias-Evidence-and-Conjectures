To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B as B. We're given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the posterior odds are the ratio of these probabilities:

Odds = (Probability of event given A) / (Probability of event given B)
     = (8/81) / (2/27)
     = 4/1

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
