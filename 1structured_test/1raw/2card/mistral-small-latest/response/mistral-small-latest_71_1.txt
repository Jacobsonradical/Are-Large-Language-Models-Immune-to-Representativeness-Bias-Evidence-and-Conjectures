To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A as A and from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The prior odds are 1/1, assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen.

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

So, the posterior odds are:

(Prior odds * Likelihood of A) / (Likelihood of B)
= (1 * 8/81) / (2/27)
= 4/2

So, the answer is:
{odds: 2}
