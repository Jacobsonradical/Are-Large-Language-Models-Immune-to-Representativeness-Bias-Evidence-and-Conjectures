{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

1. Let P(A) be the prior probability of drawing from Deck A, and P(B) be the prior probability of drawing from Deck B. Since the deck was chosen by chance, we assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

2. Let L(X|A) be the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and L(X|B) be the likelihood of drawing the same combination from Deck B.

3. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27.

4. The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/27.

5. The posterior odds are given by P(A|X)/P(B|X) = [P(A) * L(X|A)] / [P(B) * L(X|B)] = [(0.5 * 8/27)] / [(0.5 * 2/27)] = 8/2 : 1/2 = 8 : 1.

Therefore, the posterior odds are 8 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
