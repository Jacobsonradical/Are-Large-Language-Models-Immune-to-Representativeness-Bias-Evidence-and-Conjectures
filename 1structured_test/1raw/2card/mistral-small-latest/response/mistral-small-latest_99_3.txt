To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D).

First, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we need P(A) and P(B). Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|D) and P(B|D):

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D) = (8/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27 * 1/2) + (2/27 * 1/2)] = 4/5
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D) = (2/27) * (1/2) / [(8/27 * 1/2) + (2/27 * 1/2)] = 1/5

Finally, the posterior odds are P(A|D)/P(B|D) = 4/1 = 4.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
