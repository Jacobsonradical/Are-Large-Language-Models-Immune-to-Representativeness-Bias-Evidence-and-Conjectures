To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We are given that 3 cards were marked X and 1 card was marked O.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since we have no prior information about which deck was selected, we can assume that the prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B are both 1/2.

The posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is then:

Posterior odds = (Prior probability of A * Probability of evidence given A) / (Prior probability of B * Probability of evidence given B)
               = (1/2 * 8/27) / (1/2 * 2/27)
               = 4/1

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
