The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of drawing the observed cards from Deck A as P(A|data) and from Deck B as P(B|data). We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|data)/P(B|data).

The likelihood of drawing the observed data (3X, 1O) from Deck A is given by the binomial probability: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1.
The likelihood of drawing the observed data from Deck B is given by: (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1.

Prior to seeing the data, we can assume that the probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B is equal (0.5 each), since we know that one deck was selected by chance.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

The posterior odds are then:
P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)]

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5]

After calculating, the odds are approximately 16.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 16}
