The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B. Let X be the observed outcome (3 X's and 1 O).

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (with 2/3 X's) is given by the hypergeometric distribution:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(n, 3), where n is the total number of cards in Deck A.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (with 1/3 X's) is:

P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(m, 3), where m is the total number of cards in Deck B.

The exact numeric answer would depend on the total number of cards in each deck. However, without this information, we can still say that the posterior odds are greater than 1, indicating that it's more likely the cards were drawn from Deck A.
