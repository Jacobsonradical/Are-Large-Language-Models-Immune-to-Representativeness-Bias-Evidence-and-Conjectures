Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 X's and 1 O as E.

The prior probability that deck A is chosen is 1/2 (since there are two decks and we pick one at random). The probability of E given deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.

The probability of E given deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that deck A was chosen is P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = (8/81) * (1/2) / [(8/81) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2)] = 24/31.

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 24/31 / (1 - 24/31) = 24/7.

Answer: {odds: 24/7}
