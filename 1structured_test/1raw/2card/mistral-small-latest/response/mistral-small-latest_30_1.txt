Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this:

1. Define events:
   - A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
   - B: The cards were drawn from Deck A
   - E: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

2. Calculate the probability of E given A (P(E|A)):
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is 2/3
   - The probability of drawing an O from Deck A is 1/3
   - Using the binomial probability formula, P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27

3. Calculate the probability of E given B (P(E|B)):
   - The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is 1/3
   - The probability of drawing an O from Deck B is 2/3
   - Using the binomial probability formula, P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

4. Calculate the prior odds:
   - Since the deck was selected by chance, we can assume that the prior probability of A and B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5
   - Prior odds = P(A)/P(B) = 1

5. Calculate the posterior odds:
   - Posterior odds = (P(E|A)/P(E|B)) * Prior odds
   - Posterior odds = (4/27)/(8/81) * 1 = 3/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 3/2.

Answer: {odds: 1.5}
