Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. Let E be the observed evidence, which is drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find P(A|E)/P(B|E), which is the posterior odds.

First, let's calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B).

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X card is 2/3 and an O card is 1/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X card is 1/3 and an O card is 2/3. So, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:

P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

Now, we need to find P(A) and P(B), which are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since we're given no reason to believe one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, we can assume they're equally likely:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|E) and P(B|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Since P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B), we get:

P(E) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (2/243) * (1/2) = 44/486

So, the posterior odds are:

odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)] = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/243) * (1/2)] = 42/1

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 42}
