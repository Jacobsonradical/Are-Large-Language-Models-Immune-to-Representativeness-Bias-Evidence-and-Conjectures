{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume event A is drawing 4 cards from Deck A and event B is drawing 4 cards from Deck B.
2. The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
3. The probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.
4. The posterior odds are the ratio of the probabilities of the events given the evidence: (8/27) / (2/243) = 8.
