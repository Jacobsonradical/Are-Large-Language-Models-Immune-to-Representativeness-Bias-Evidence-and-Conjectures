To answer this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the cards were drawn from deck A, and B represent the event that the cards were drawn from deck B. We are looking for the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

First, let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(3 X's, 1 O | A) = C(2/3 n, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3 X's, 1 O | B) = C(1/3 n, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

where n is the number of cards in each deck (assumed to be large), and C(a, b) is the combination of choosing b items from a set of size a.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A) * P(3 X's, 1 O | A)] / [P(B) * P(3 X's, 1 O | B)]

Since we have no reason to believe that one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Plugging in the probabilities and simplifying, we get:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
                      = 8

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 8 to 1.

Final answer: {odds: 8}
