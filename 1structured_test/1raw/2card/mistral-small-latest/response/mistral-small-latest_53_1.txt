To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.

Since the decks were chosen randomly, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

So, the posterior odds are P(A)/P(B) = [P(A|data) * P(A)] / [P(B|data) * P(B)] = [(8/81) * 0.5] / [(2/243) * 0.5] = 108/2 = 54.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 54}
