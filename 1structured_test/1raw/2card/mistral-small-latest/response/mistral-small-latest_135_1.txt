To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A as A, and the event of drawing them from Deck B as B. We want to find P(A|X)/P(B|X), where X is the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

First, we need to find P(X|A) and P(X|B), which are the probabilities of observing the data given that the cards were drawn from deck A or B respectively.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we need P(A) and P(B), which are the probabilities of selecting deck A or B initially. Since it's stated that one of the decks has been selected by chance, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Odds = P(A|X)/P(B|X) = [P(X|A)*P(A)] / [P(X|B)*P(B)] = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 8/2

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
