Let's calculate the probabilities of drawing the given cards from each deck:

For Deck A:
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

The posterior odds are the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior odds = (Probability of drawing from Deck A) / (Probability of drawing from Deck B)
= (8/81) / (2/81)
= 4

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
