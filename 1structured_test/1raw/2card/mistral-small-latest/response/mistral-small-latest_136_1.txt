To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from deck A as A and the event of drawing the cards from deck B as B.

We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where data represents the observed data, i.e., drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data) and P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data).

Since both decks were chosen by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is given by the binomial distribution: P(data|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81.

Similarly, P(data|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81.

The posterior odds are then P(A|data) / P(B|data) = (32/81) * 0.5 / (8/81) * 0.5 = 4.

So, the answer is {odds: 4}.
