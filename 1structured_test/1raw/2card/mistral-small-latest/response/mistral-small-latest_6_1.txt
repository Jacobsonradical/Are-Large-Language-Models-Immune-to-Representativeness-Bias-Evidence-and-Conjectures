To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), which is the posterior odds of A given X.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Since the deck was selected at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B):

- P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A. This can be calculated as the binomial probability: C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27
- P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B. This can be calculated as: C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81

The probability of the evidence X, regardless of which deck was chosen, is given by the law of total probability:

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (4/27 * 0.5) + (4/81 * 0.5) = 14/162

Now we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)] = [(4/27) * 0.5] / [(4/81) * 0.5] = 6

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 6.

Answer: {odds: 6}
