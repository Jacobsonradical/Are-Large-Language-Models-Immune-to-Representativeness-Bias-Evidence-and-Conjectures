To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from Deck A as A and the event of drawing the cards from Deck B as B.

The prior odds, or the odds before drawing any cards, are 1:1 because both decks were chosen with equal probability.

The likelihood ratio is the probability of the observed evidence (3 Xs and 1 O) given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, divided by the probability of the observed evidence given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27. The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

So, the likelihood ratio is 8/27 : 2/27 = 4:1.

The posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are 4:1.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
