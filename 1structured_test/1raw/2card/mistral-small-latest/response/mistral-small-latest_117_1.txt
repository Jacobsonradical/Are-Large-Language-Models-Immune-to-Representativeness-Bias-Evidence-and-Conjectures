To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, as the deck was selected by chance.

Let E be the event that 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O are drawn. We need to find the posterior odds P(A|E)/P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Now, we need to find P(E|A) and P(E|B).

For deck A:
P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
Using the binomial probability formula, P(E|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27

For deck B:
P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
Using the binomial probability formula, P(E|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81

Finally, we can find the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                             = (4/27 * 0.5) / (4/81 * 0.5) = 3

So, the answer is:
{odds: 3}
