To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events A and B. Let's denote the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data).

First, let's find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

Similarly, for Deck B:
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we need the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since we have no reason to believe that one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = [P(A|data) / P(B|data)] * [P(A) / P(B)]
= [(8/27) / (2/27)] * [0.5 / 0.5]
= 4

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Answer: {odds: 4}
