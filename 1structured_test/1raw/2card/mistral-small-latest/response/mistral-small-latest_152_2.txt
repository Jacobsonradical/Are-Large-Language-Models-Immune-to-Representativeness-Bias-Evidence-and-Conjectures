Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A represent the event that the deck selected is Deck A, and B represent the event that the deck selected is Deck B. We want to find P(A|data)/P(B|data).

Let X represent the event of drawing an X card, and O represent the event of drawing an O card. The data given is that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn.

P(data|A) = P(X,X,X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(data|B) = P(X,X,X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was chosen at random)

So, the posterior odds are P(A|data)/P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)] = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 16/3.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 16/3}
