To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing the cards from deck A as A, and the event of drawing the cards from deck B as B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since the deck was chosen at random.

We also need to calculate the likelihood of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from deck A, P(3X, 1O|A), and the likelihood of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from deck B, P(3X, 1O|B).

Assuming the cards are drawn without replacement:

P(3X, 1O|A) = C(2/3*n, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = C(1/3*n, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

where n is the total number of cards in the deck, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

The posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
               = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

Since the prior probabilities are equal, they cancel out. Therefore, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio:

Posterior odds = P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)

This is a ratio of two probabilities and will depend on the total number of cards in the deck. Without knowing the value of n, I cannot provide a numerical answer. However, you can calculate it once you have the value of n.
