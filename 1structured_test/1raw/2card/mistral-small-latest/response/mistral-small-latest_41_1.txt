Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X), where X is the observation that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / P(X)
P(B|X) = [P(X|B) * P(B)] / P(X)

Since we don't know the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can only find the ratio of the posterior probabilities, which is equal to the ratio of the products of the likelihood and the prior probabilities:

[P(A|X) / P(B|X)] = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Assuming an equal prior probability of selecting Deck A or Deck B (i.e., P(A) = P(B)), this simplifies to:

[P(A|X) / P(B|X)] = P(X|A) / P(X|B)

Now, we need to find the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

odds = P(X|A) / P(X|B) = 8/27 / 2/27 = 4

Final answer: {odds: 4}
