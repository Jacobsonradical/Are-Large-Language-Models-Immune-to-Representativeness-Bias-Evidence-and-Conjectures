{odds: 16}

To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

First, let's find the likelihood ratio, which is P(X|A)/P(X|B), where X is the observed evidence (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / C(n, 4), where n is the total number of cards in the deck and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / C(n, 4).

The likelihood ratio is then [C(2n/3, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [C(n/3, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)] = [C(2n/3, 3) * (2/1)^3] / [C(n/3, 3)].

Since n is very large, we can approximate the binomial coefficients using the normal distribution. Then, the likelihood ratio simplifies to (16/3)^3 â‰ˆ 16.

Since the prior odds of drawing from Deck A or Deck B is 1 (assuming equal probability), the posterior odds is also 16.
