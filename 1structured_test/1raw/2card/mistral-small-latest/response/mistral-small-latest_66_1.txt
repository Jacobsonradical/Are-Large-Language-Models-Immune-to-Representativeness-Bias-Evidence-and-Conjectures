Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A)/P(B).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Since the deck was selected at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming an equal number of cards in both decks).

So, the posterior odds are:

P(A)/P(B) = [P(A) * likelihood of drawing 3X, 1O given A)] / [P(B) * likelihood of drawing 3X, 1O given B)]
= (0.5 * 8/81) / (0.5 * 2/27)
= 8/81 * 27/2
= 126/162
= 42/54
= 7/9

So, the answer is:
{odds: 7/9}
