Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. We'll denote the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A as P(A) and from Deck B as P(B). We're given equal chances of selecting either deck, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2222.
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0089.

So, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(A | data) / P(B | data)
               = [P(data | A) * P(A)] / [P(data | B) * P(B)]
               = (0.2222 * 0.5) / (0.0089 * 0.5)
               = 24.9648

So, the answer is:
{odds: 24.9648}

This means that it's about 25 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
