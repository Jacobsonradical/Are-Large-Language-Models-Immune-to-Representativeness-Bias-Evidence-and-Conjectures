To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
X: Drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card

We need to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2 (since one of the decks was chosen at random).

Calculating P(X|A):
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

Calculating P(X|B):
The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B is also given by the binomial distribution:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Now, we can find P(X), which is the total probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from either deck:
P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (8/81)*(1/2) + (2/27)*(1/2) = 5/81

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)] = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = 4/1

So, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Answer: {odds: 4}
