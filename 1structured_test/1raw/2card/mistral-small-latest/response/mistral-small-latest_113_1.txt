To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the deck selected is A as D_A and B as D_B. Similarly, let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card given deck A as E_A and given deck B as E_B.

We want to find P(D_A | E) / P(D_B | E), where E is the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(D_A | E) = P(E | D_A) * P(D_A) / P(E)
P(D_B | E) = P(E | D_B) * P(D_B) / P(E)

Since we have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to be selected than the other, we can assume P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A is given by the binomial distribution:

P(E | D_A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1

Similarly, for deck B:

P(E | D_B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

The probability of E is the sum of the probabilities of E given each deck:

P(E) = P(E | D_A) * P(D_A) + P(E | D_B) * P(D_B)

So, the posterior odds are:

(P(D_A | E) / P(D_B | E)) = (P(E | D_A) * P(D_A)) / (P(E | D_B) * P(D_B))

After calculating the probabilities and plugging them in, the result is approximately 12.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 12}
