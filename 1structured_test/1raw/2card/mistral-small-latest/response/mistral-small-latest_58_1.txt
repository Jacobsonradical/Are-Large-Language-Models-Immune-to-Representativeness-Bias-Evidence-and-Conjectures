Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let D be the evidence that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D).

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the deck was selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is given by the hypergeometric distribution:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(2n/3, 3) / C(2n, 4)

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(n/3, 3) / C(n, 4)

The total probability of the evidence is:
P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)

So, the posterior odds are:
(P(A|D) / P(B|D)) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

We can't provide a single number without knowing the total number of cards in each deck (denoted by n for Deck A and 2n for Deck B). However, the expression for the posterior odds is provided above.
