To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A: The event that the deck drawn is Deck A
B: The event that the deck drawn is Deck B
X: The event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X
O: The event that 1 out of 4 cards drawn is marked O

We want to find P(A|X∩O)/P(B|X∩O).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X∩O) = P(X∩O|A) * P(A) / P(X∩O)
P(B|X∩O) = P(X∩O|B) * P(B) / P(X∩O)

Since the deck was chosen at random, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we need to find P(X∩O|A) and P(X∩O|B).

For Deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(O|A) = (1/3)
Since X and O are independent events given A, P(X∩O|A) = P(X|A) * P(O|A)

For Deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)
P(O|B) = (2/3)
Again, P(X∩O|B) = P(X|B) * P(O|B)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|X∩O) / P(B|X∩O)
               = [P(X∩O|A) * P(A)] / [P(X∩O|B) * P(B)]
               = [P(X|A) * P(O|A)] / [P(X|B) * P(O|B)]
               = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
               = 64

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 64.

Answer: {odds: 64}
