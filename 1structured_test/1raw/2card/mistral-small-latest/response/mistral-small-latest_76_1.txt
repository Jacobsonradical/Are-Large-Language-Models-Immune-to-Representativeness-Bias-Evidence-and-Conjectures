To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|data) / P(B|data), where "data" refers to the observed outcome of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, let's find the likelihood of the data given each deck.

P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/243
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/243

Now, we need the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). Since the deck was chosen at random, we can assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
           = (8/243) * (1/2) / ((8/243)*(1/2) + (2/243)*(1/2))
           = 4/27

P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)
           = (2/243) * (1/2) / ((8/243)*(1/2) + (2/243)*(1/2))
           = 1/27

The posterior odds are therefore P(A|data) / P(B|data) = 4/1 = 4.

So, the answer is: {odds: 4}
