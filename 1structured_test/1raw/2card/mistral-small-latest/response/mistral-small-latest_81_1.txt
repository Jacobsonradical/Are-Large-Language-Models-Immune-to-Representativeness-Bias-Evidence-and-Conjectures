To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find P(A|data)/P(B|data).

The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution: P(data|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4/27.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O cards from Deck B is P(data|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4/81.

The prior probabilities of drawing from Deck A and Deck B are assumed to be equal (since the deck was chosen at random), so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / [P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B)]
           = (4/27) * 0.5 / [(4/27) * 0.5 + (4/81) * 0.5]
           = 0.5714

P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / [P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B)]
           = (4/81) * 0.5 / [(4/27) * 0.5 + (4/81) * 0.5]
           = 0.4286

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A are P(A|data) / P(B|data) = 0.5714 / 0.4286 â‰ˆ 1.333.

Therefore, the answer is {odds: 1.333}.
