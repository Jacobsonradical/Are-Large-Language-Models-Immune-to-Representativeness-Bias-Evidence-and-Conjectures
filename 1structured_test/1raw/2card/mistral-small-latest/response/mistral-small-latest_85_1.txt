To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the deck chosen is Deck A, and B be the event that the deck chosen is Deck B. Let D be the observed data, which is drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which is the posterior odds of the deck being Deck A given the data.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
and P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we are only interested in the ratio of these probabilities, we can ignore the P(D) term which is common to both.

P(A) and P(B) are both 1/2 since the deck was chosen at random.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A. This can be calculated as (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. This can be calculated as (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

(P(A|D) / P(B|D)) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B)) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/27 * 1/2) = 8/2 = {odds: 4}
