{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's denote P(A) and P(B) as the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since we have no reason to believe one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.
2. Let's denote L(A) as the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A, and L(B) as the likelihood of drawing the same configuration from Deck B.
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.
4. The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.
5. The posterior odds of Deck A vs Deck B are given by the formula: P(A)/P(B) * L(A)/L(B).
6. Substituting the values, we get: (0.5/0.5) * (8/27)/(2/27) = 8.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
