To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was selected by chance).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81, and from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of A is P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / [P(data|A) * P(A) + P(data|B) * P(B)] = (8/81) * 0.5 / [(8/81) * 0.5 + (2/27) * 0.5] = 16/39.

The posterior probability of B is P(B|data) = 1 - P(A|data) = 23/39.

So, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is P(A|data) / P(B|data) = 16/23.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 16/23}
