To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. We want to find P(A|D)/P(B|D), where D is the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing such a hand from Deck A, which can be calculated as the binomial probability: C(4,3)*(2/3)^3*(1/3)^1 = 4/27.

Similarly, P(D|B) is the probability of drawing such a hand from Deck B, which is: C(4,3)*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^1 = 4/81.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|D) = P(D|A)*P(A)/P(D) and P(B|D) = P(D|B)*P(B)/P(D). Since we don't have prior probabilities for P(A) and P(B), let's assume they're equal (i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5). Then P(D) = P(D|A)*P(A) + P(D|B)*P(B).

Substituting these values, we get P(A|D) = (4/27)*0.5 / (4/27*0.5 + 4/81*0.5) = 4/6 = 2/3.

So, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2/3.

Answer: {odds: 2/3}
