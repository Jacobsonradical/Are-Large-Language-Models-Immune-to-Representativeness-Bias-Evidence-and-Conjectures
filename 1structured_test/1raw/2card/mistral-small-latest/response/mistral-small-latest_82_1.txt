To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability.

Let A be the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. Let X be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X).

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|X) = P(X|A)P(A)/P(X), and similarly for P(B|X). We know that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, since the deck was chosen at random.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution: P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27.

Similarly, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27.

The total probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is P(X) = P(X|A)P(A) + P(X|B)P(B) = (8/27 + 2/27)/2 = 5/27.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A|X)/P(B|X) = (P(X|A)P(A))/(P(X|B)P(B)) = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5) = 4.

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
