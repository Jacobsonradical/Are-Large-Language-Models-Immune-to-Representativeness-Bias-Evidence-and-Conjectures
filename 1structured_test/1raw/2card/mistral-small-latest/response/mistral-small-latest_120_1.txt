To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, instead of calculating the exact posterior probabilities, we can calculate the odds ratio, which is often more convenient.

Let's denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that they were drawn from Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|data)/P(B|data).

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data)
P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data)

Since we have no prior information about the selection of the decks, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. This assumption will cancel out in the odds ratio.

Now, let's calculate P(data|A) and P(data|B). This is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

So, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data)) = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/27) * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
