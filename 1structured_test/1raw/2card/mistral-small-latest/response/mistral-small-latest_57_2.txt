Let's denote the event of selecting Deck A as A and the event of selecting Deck B as B. We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X)/P(B|X), where X is the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(A|X) = P(X|A)P(A)/P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B)P(B)/P(X)

Since the deck was selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Let's calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B).
For deck A:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)

For deck B:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A|X)/P(B|X) = (P(X|A)P(A)) / (P(X|B)P(B))
                             = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
                             â‰ˆ 16

So, the answer is:
{odds: 16}
