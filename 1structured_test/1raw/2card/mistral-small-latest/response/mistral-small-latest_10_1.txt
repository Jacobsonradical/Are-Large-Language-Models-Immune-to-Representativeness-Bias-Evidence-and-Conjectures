I cannot provide a single number as an answer. The posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A and B be the events that the cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Let X be the observed evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:

Posterior odds = P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Assuming both decks are equally likely to be chosen initially, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

The probability of drawing the observed evidence given each deck (P(X|A) and P(X|B)) can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

Posterior odds = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5]

After simplifying:

Posterior odds = (2^3 * 1) / (1^3 * 2) = 8

So, the posterior odds are 8 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
