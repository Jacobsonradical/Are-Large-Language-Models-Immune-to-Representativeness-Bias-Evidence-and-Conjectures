{odds: 8}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio times the prior odds.
2. The prior odds are 1:1 since both decks were chosen with equal probability.
3. The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81.
4. The likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243.
5. The likelihood ratio is (8/81) / (2/243) = 8.
6. Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are also 8:1 in favor of Deck A.
