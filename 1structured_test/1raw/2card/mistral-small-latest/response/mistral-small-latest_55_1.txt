Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then compare these probabilities to get the odds.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 1/3
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 2/3
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/243

So the odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

Odds = (Probability of Deck A) / (Probability of Deck B) = 8/2 = 4

Answer:
{odds: 4}
