To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that they were drawn from Deck B. We are given the prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the deck was selected by chance), and we want to find the posterior odds P(A|data) / P(B|data).

Let X be the event that a card drawn at random is marked X. Given the probabilities of X in each deck, we have P(X|A) = 2/3 and P(X|B) = 1/3. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3), and from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|data) = P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data), and P(B|data) = P(data|B) * P(B) / P(data).

The posterior odds are then P(A|data) / P(B|data) = [P(data|A) * P(A)] / [P(data|B) * P(B)] = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5] = 16.

So, the answer is {odds: 16}.
