To begin solving this, we'll compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use these likelihoods to determine the posterior odds favoring Deck A over Deck B.

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:**
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck A: \(P(X \mid A) = \frac{2}{3}\)
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck A: \(P(O \mid A) = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Using binomial probability, \(P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1\)
   - \(P(3X, 1O \mid A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}\)

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:**
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck B: \(P(X \mid B) = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck B: \(P(O \mid B) = \frac{2}{3}\)
   - Using binomial probability, \(P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1\)
   - \(P(3X, 1O \mid B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}\)

3. **Posterior odds ratio favoring Deck A over Deck B:**
   - This is computed by comparing the likelihood ratios: \(\frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}}\)
   - Simplifying, \(\frac{32}{81} \div \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4\)

Thus, the posterior odds that Deck A was chosen over Deck B given the observed draw of 3 X's and 1 O are 4:1.

Therefore, in the format required:
{odds: 4}
