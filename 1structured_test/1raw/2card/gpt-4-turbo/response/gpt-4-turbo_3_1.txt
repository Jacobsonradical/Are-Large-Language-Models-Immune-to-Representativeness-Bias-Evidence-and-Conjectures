To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed evidence (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we first calculate the likelihood of this data under each deck's card distribution, then use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the deck choice.

**Step 1: Calculating the Likelihoods.**

For Deck A (2/3 cards are X, 1/3 cards are O), the probability that 3 cards drawn are X and 1 is O is calculated as:
\[ P(Data|Deck A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 cards are X, 2/3 cards are O), the probability that 3 cards drawn are X and 1 is O is calculated as:
\[ P(Data|Deck B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 2: Bayes' Theorem and Prior Odds.**

Assuming the prior odds of selecting either deck were even (1:1), the prior probability for each deck is 1/2.

**Step 3: Posterior Odds Calculation.**

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(Data|Deck A) \times P(Deck A)}{P(Data|Deck B) \times P(Deck B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
