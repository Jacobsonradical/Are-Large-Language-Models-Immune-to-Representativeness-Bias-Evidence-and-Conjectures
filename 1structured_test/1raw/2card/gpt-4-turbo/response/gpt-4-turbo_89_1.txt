To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck. We then apply Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence provided by the card draw.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability the selected deck is A
- P(B) as the probability the selected deck is B
- P(E|A) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck A
- P(E|B) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from deck B

Since A and B were equally likely to be selected initially, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of an event E occurring given deck A (P(E|A)) can be derived using the binomial coefficient formula:
P(E|A) = (choose 4, 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^(4 - 3)
P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1
P(E|A) = 4 × (8/27) × (1/3)
P(E|A) = 4 × (8/81)
P(E|A) = 32/81

Similarly, for deck B:
P(E|B) = (choose 4, 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^(4 - 3)
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^(1)
P(E|B) = 4 × (1/27) × (2/3)
P(E|B) = 4 × (2/81)
P(E|B) = 8/81

The posterior odds ratio for A to B based on the evidence can be given by:
Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [P(E|A) × P(A)] / [P(E|B) × P(B)]
Plugging in the values from above:
Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = [(32/81) × 1/2] / [(8/81) × 1/2]
Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = (32/81) / (8/81)
Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = 32 / 8
Odds(A|E) / Odds(B|E) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, in comparison to Deck B, is 4.
