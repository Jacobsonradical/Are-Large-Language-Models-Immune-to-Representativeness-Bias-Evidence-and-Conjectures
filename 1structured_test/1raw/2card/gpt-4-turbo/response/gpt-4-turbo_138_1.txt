To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence.

**Step 1: Calculate likelihood for each deck**

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are X, 1/3 are O
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are X, 2/3 are O

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \cdot (8/81) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 32/81 \]

Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \cdot (2/81) \]
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 8/81 \]

**Step 2: Bayes' Theorem and calculating posterior odds**

Let the odds of choosing Deck A originally be equal to the odds of choosing Deck B:
\[ O(A:B)_{prior} = 1 \]

Using the likelihoods we calculated:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \times \text{Prior Odds} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A are 4.

{odds: 4}
