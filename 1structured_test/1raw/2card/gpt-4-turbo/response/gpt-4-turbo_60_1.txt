To solve this question, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. We'll calculate the probability of observing the data (3 X's, 1 O) given each of the decks (Deck A and Deck B), and then use this to find the posterior odds. 

1. **Setting the priors**: Let's assume equal probability of choosing either deck A or B, thus \( P(\text{A}) = P(\text{B}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Calculating likelihoods**: We need to calculate \( P(\text{data} \mid \text{A}) \) and \( P(\text{data} \mid \text{B}) \).
   - **For deck A**, where \( P(X \mid A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O \mid A) = \frac{1}{3} \):
     \[
     P(\text{data} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - **For deck B**, where \( P(X \mid B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O \mid B) = \frac{2}{3} \):
     \[
     P(\text{data} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Calculating the posterior odds**:
   \[
   \text{Odds}(A \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   - Using our likelihoods calculated and assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \):
     \[
     \text{Odds}(A \mid \text{data}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

So the posterior odds that deck A (more X's) was chosen, given the evidence (3 X's and 1 O) compared to deck B (more O's), is 4.
