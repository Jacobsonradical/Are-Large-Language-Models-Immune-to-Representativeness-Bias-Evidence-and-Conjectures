To find the posterior odds in favor of Deck A against Deck B given that we've drawn 3 Xs and 1 O, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

1. Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) denote the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since the problem states that one of the decks is selected by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

2. Let \( E \) be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in 4 cards. We need to calculate the conditional probabilities \( P(E \mid A) \) and \( P(E \mid B) \), and then use these to compute the posterior odds.

First, calculating \( P(E \mid A) \) (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A):
- Deck A has 2/3 of the cards marked X and 1/3 marked O.
- The number of ways to choose 3 Xs from 4 cards can be obtained by the combination formula, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to select which of the 4 cards is an O.
- Therefore, the probability \( P(E \mid A) = 4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 = 0.3951 \).

Now, calculating \( P(E \mid B) \) (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B):
- Deck B has 1/3 of the cards marked X and 2/3 marked O.
- Using similar reasoning as above, \( P(E \mid B) = 4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 = 0.0988 \).

3. Using Bayes' rule extended to odds form:
   \[
   \frac{P(A \mid E)}{P(B \mid E)} \text{ (Posterior Odds)} = \frac{P(E \mid A)}{P(E \mid B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}.
   \]
   Substituting, we get:
   \[
   \frac{P(A \mid E)}{P(B \mid E)} = \frac{0.3951}{0.0988} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.3951}{0.0988}.
   \]
   Calculating this gives approximately 4.00.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A instead of Deck B are around 4:1, which numerically is,

{odds: 4.00}
