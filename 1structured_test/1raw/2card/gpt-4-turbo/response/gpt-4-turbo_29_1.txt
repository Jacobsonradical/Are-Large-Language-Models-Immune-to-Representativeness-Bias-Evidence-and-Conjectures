To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities that the cards are drawn from Deck A (most cards marked X) and Deck B (most cards marked O), given the observed evidence of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. 

Let \( D_A \) be the event that Deck A was selected and \( D_B \) be the event that Deck B was selected. Let \( E \) be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We are given:
- \( P(X|D_A) = 2/3 \)
- \( P(O|D_A) = 1/3 \)
- \( P(X|D_B) = 1/3 \)
- \( P(O|D_B) = 2/3 \)

We need to use the binomial probability formula, \( P(E|D) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \):
- For Deck A, \( P(E|D_A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 32/81 \).
- For Deck B, \( P(E|D_B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 8/81 \).

Assuming the decks were equally likely to be chosen, \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 1/2 \).

By Bayesâ€™ theorem, the posterior odds ratio \(\frac{P(D_A|E)}{P(D_B|E)}\) equals the prior odds ratio times the likelihood ratio of the observed evidence.

The likelihood ratio is \(\frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4\).

Thus, the posterior odds ratio is \( \frac{P(D_A)}{P(D_B)} \times \frac{P(E|D_A)}{P(E|D_B)} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \).

Hence, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
