To find the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we use Bayes' Theorem.

**Step 1: Calculate probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.**

From **Deck A** (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the combination \(\binom{4}{3}\) multiplied by the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[
P(\text{3X, 1O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

From **Deck B** (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[
P(\text{3X, 1O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate prior odds.**
Since we are not given any reason to believe one deck is more likely to be chosen than the other, we take the prior odds to be 1:1. 

**Step 3: Calculate posterior odds using Bayes' Rule.**
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \text{Prior Odds} \times \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O from A})}{P(\text{3X, 1O from B})}
\]
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
