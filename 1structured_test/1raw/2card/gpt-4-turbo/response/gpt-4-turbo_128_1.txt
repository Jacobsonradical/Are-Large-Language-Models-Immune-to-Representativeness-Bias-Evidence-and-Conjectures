To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' theorem.

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing an X in Deck A = 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O in Deck A = 1/3
   - The number of ways to arrange 3 X's and 1 O is \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   - Thus, the probability for this specific sequence (XXXO) from Deck A is:  
     \((2/3)^3 \times (1/3) = (8/27) \times (1/3) = 8/81\)
   - Therefore, the probability for any sequence of 3 X's and 1 O is \(4 \times 8/81 = 32/81\).

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing an X in Deck B = 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O in Deck B = 2/3
   - The probability for this specific sequence (XXXO) from Deck B is:
     \((1/3)^3 \times (2/3) = (1/27) \times (2/3) = 2/81\)
   - Thus, the probability for any sequence of 3 X's and 1 O is \(4 \times 2/81 = 8/81\).

3. Prior probability of selecting each deck:
   - Since one deck is selected by chance, \( P(\text{Deck A}) = P(\text{Deck B}) = 1/2 \).

4. Using Bayes' theorem, calculate the posterior probabilities:
   - \( P(\text{Deck A} | \text{Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data} | \text{Deck A}) \times P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{Data})} \)
   - \( P(\text{Deck B} | \text{Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data} | \text{Deck B}) \times P(\text{Deck B})}{P(\text{Data})} \)

   Where:
   - \( P(\text{Data}) = P(\text{Data} | \text{Deck A}) \times P(\text{Deck A}) + P(\text{Data} | \text{Deck B}) \times P(\text{Deck B}) \)
   - \( P(\text{Data}) = (32/81 \times 1/2) + (8/81 \times 1/2) = (32/162) + (8/162) = 40/162 = 20/81 \)

   Calculating posteriors:
   - \( P(\text{Deck A} | \text{Data}) = \frac{(32/81) \times (1/2)}{20/81} = \frac{32/162}{20/81} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(\text{Deck B} | \text{Data}) = \frac{(8/81) \times (1/2)}{20/81} = \frac{8/162}{20/81} = \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \)

5. Finally, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B:
   - Odds = \( \frac{P(\text{Deck A} | \text{Data})}{P(\text{Deck B} | \text{Data})} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \).

Thus, the response is:

{odds: 4}
