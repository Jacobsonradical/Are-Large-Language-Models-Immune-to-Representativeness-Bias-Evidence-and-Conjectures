To solve this problem and determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we must use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the probability of drawing from each deck based on the evidence of the drawn cards.

We start by defining the events:
- Let A represent the event of choosing Deck A.
- Let B represent the event of choosing Deck B.
- Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

We know:
- \( P(\text{X in A}) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(\text{O in A}) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- \( P(\text{X in B}) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(\text{O in B}) = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Since we are choosing between Deck A and Deck B randomly, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (D given A) can be calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Then, using Bayes' theorem, we compute the posterior probabilities:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
