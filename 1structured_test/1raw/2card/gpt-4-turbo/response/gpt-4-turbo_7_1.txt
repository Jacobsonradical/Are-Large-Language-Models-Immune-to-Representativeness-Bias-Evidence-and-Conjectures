To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given that 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn, we first need to calculate the prior odds, the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then adjust the prior odds by these likelihoods to get the posterior odds. We do this as follows:

**Step 1: Calculating Prior Odds**
Since one deck was selected by chance, the prior odds of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, hence:
\[ \text{Prior Odds} = \frac{P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{Deck B})} = 1 \]

**Step 2: Calculating Likelihoods**
Given the distributions in the decks:
- Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Using the binomial distribution formula \( P(k \text{ successes in } n \text{ trials}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \):
- From Deck A (3 Xs, 1 O):
\[ P(3X, 1O | \text{Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

- From Deck B (3 Xs, 1 O):
\[ P(3X, 1O | \text{Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 3: Calculating Posterior Odds**
Using Bayes' Theorem, adjust the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \text{Prior Odds} \cdot \frac{P(3X, 1O | \text{Deck A})}{P(3X, 1O | \text{Deck B})} = 1 \cdot \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
