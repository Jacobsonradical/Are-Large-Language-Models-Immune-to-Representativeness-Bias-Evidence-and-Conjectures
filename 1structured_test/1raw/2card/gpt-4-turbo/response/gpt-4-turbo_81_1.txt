To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck (likelihood), and then use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs (prior odds) about the probability of choosing each deck in light of the new evidence (the observed card draws).

### Step 1: Calculate the likelihoods
For **Deck A** (Probability of X = 2/3 and O = 1/3):
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O = \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \).

For **Deck B** (Probability of X = 1/3 and O = 2/3):
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O =  \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \).

### Step 2: Calculate prior odds
Assume prior odds of selecting either deck are equal, thus:
- Prior odds (Deck A : Deck B) = 1 : 1.

### Step 3: Calculate posterior odds using Bayes' theorem
The posterior odds are derived by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio of the evidence:
- Likelihood ratio = \( \frac{\text{Likelihood of evidence given Deck A}}{\text{Likelihood of evidence given Deck B}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \).

Thus, the **posterior odds** of selecting Deck A versus Deck B given the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is 4:1.
