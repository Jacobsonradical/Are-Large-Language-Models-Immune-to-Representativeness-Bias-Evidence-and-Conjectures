To solve for the posterior odds that the four cards came from deck A rather than deck B, given the observed card draws, we use Bayes' theorem. First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck.

**Calculations:**

Let $pA$ and $pB$ be the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from decks A and B, respectively. Let's also assume initially that decks A and B are equally likely to have been chosen, so the prior probabilities are 0.5 each.

Deck A: 
- Probability of drawing a card marked X = 2/3.
- Probability of drawing a card marked O = 1/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, in any order, from Deck A is calculated as a combination of choosing 3 out of 4 draws multiplied by the probability of each selection:

$$ pA = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) $$

Deck B:
- Probability of drawing a card marked X = 1/3.
- Probability of drawing a card marked O = 2/3.
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is similarly calculated as:

$$ pB = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) $$

**Calculation in Numbers:**

$$ pA = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} $$

$$ pB = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} $$

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**

Now, using the likelihoods $pA$ and $pB$ and assuming initially equal priors, the posterior odds ratio in favor of A over B is given by:

$$ \text{Odds} = \frac{pA}{pB} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. $$

Hence, after observing the card draw, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are 4:1.
