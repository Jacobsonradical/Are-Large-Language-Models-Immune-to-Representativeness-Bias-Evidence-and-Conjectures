To answer this, we need to calculate the posterior odds ratio for drawing the cards from Deck A versus Deck B given the sample of cards drawn. This involves Bayesian updating based on the information provided.

1. **Prior odds**: The prior odds for selecting Deck A versus Deck B is 1, as it is stated that one of the decks was selected by chance.

2. **Calculating likelihoods**:
   - **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P)**:
     - Deck A has a probability of 2/3 of drawing an X, and 1/3 of drawing an O.
     - The probability of drawing 3 X's followed by 1 O (in any order) from Deck A is:
       \[
       \binom{4}{3}(2/3)^3*(1/3)^1 = 4*(8/27)*(1/3) = 32/81.
       \]
   
   - **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (Q)**:
     - Deck B has a probability of 1/3 of drawing an X, and 2/3 of drawing an O.
     - The probability of drawing 3 X's followed by 1 O (in any order) from Deck B is:
       \[
       \binom{4}{3}(1/3)^3*(2/3)^1 = 4*(1/27)*(2/3) = 8/81.
       \]

3. **Calculate the likelihood ratio (L)**:
   \[
   L = \frac{P}{Q} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4.
   \]

4. **Posterior odds**:
   - Given that the prior odds are 1:1 (equal likelihood of choosing Deck A or Deck B initially), and the likelihood ratio (from the evidential data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O) is 4, the posterior odds are updated by multiplying the prior odds with the likelihood ratio:
   \[
   \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times L = 1 \times 4 = 4.
   \]

So, given the data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O, the odds that these were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

Thus, the response is:
{odds: 4}
