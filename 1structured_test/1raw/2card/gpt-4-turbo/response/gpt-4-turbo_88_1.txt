Let's calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck:

For Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O):
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O):
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated similarly:
\[ P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The prior odds are 1:1 (since one deck was selected by chance), so the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are proportional to the likelihoods multiplied by the priors:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

This shows the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
