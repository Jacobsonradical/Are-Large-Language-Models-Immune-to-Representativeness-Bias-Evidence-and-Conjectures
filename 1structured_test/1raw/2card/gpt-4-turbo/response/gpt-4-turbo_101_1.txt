To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then apply Bayes' theorem.

**Step 1: Compute the likelihood for each deck.**

For Deck A:

- Probability of drawing an X = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 1/3
- The likelihood of drawing exactly 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial formula \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \)

\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4, \quad \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

\[
P(\text{3 X, 1 O | Deck A}) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

For Deck B:

- Probability of drawing an X = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 2/3
- The likelihood of drawing exactly 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is similarly calculated by:

\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4, \quad \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}, \quad \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = \frac{2}{3}
\]

\[
P(\text{3 X, 1 O | Deck B}) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem and find posterior odds.**

Assuming the prior probability that either deck was chosen is equally likely (1/2), the posterior odds can be derived:

\[
\frac{P(\text{Deck A | 3 X, 1 O})}{P(\text{Deck B | 3 X, 1 O})} = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | Deck A})P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | Deck B})P(\text{Deck B})}
\]

\[
= \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
