To find the solution, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to compute \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \). The posterior odds for \( A \) compared to \( B \) will be \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

Step 1: Compute probabilities of selecting each deck.
Since one of the decks is chosen at random:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Step 2: Calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):
- For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O):
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]
- For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O):
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to compute posterior probabilities:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B|D) = 1 - P(A|D) = \frac{1}{5} \]

Step 4: Compute the odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \):
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
