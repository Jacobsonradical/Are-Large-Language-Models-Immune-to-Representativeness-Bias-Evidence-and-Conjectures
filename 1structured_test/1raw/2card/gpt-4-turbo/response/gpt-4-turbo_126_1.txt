To solve this problem, we need to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O). We can use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence from the draw.

Assume the prior probability of choosing either deck is equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Let \( D \) be the event "draw 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O." We need to calculate:
\[ P(D | A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(D | B) \]

**Deck A:** 2/3 of the cards are X, 1/3 are O.
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Deck B:** 1/3 of the cards are X, 2/3 are O.
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Odds}(A : B) = \frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B | D) = \frac{P(D | B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | A) P(A) + P(D | B) P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{20}{81} \]

\[ \text{Odds}(A : B) = \frac{P(D | A) / P(D)}{P(D | B) / P(D)} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than from Deck B, given that we witnessed 3 X's and 1 O, is 4:1.

Therefore, the answer formatted per your request is:
{odds: 4}
