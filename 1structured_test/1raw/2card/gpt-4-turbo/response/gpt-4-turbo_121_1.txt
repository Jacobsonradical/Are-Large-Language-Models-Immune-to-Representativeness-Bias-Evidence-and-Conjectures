To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' Theorem and calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let \( P(D = A) \) be the prior probability that Deck A was chosen, and \( P(D = B) \) that Deck B was chosen. Since the deck is chosen by chance, \( P(D = A) = P(D = B) = 0.5 \).

Calculating the likelihoods:
- For Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial formula \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \).
- For Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O), the probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O in any order is \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \).

Calculations:
- \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Probability for Deck A: \( 4 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- Probability for Deck B: \( 4 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \)

Posterior odds are the ratio of these probabilities, accounting for equal priors:
\[ \frac{P(D = A | \text{3 X's and 1 O})}{P(D = B | \text{3 X's and 1 O})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A relative to Deck B are:
