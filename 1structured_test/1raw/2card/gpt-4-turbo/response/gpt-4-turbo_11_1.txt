To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of selecting each deck given the observed draw of 3 Xs and 1 O, and then compute the posterior odds.

1. **Calculate the prior odds**: 
   Suppose the probability of selecting either deck is equal: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

2. **Calculate the likelihoods**:
   - **Deck A**: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A, where the probability of drawing an 'X' is 2/3 and 'O' is 1/3:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - **Deck B**: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B, where the probability of drawing an 'X' is 1/3 and 'O' is 2/3:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Compute posterior probabilities**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem (recalling that our prior probability for each deck, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2):
     \[
     P(A | Data) = \frac{P(Data | A) P(A)}{P(Data)} \quad \text{and} \quad P(B | Data) = \frac{P(Data | B) P(B)}{P(Data)}
     \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(Data) = P(Data | A)P(A) + P(Data | B)P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81}
   \]
   - So:
     \[
     P(A | Data) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
     \]
     \[
     P(B | Data) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

4. **Calculate the posterior odds**:
   \[
   \text{Odds}(A:B | Data) = \frac{P(A | Data)}{P(B | Data)} = \frac{4/5}{1/5} = 4
   \]

Therefore:
{odds: 4}
