To find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A (more Xs) compared to Deck B (more Os), after observing 3 Xs and 1 O from a draw of 4 cards, we will use Bayesian probability updating. 

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck:

**1. Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:**

Deck A has 2/3 of its cards marked X and 1/3 marked O. The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial formula:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**2. Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:**

Deck B has 1/3 of its cards marked X and 2/3 marked O. Thus, the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**3. Calculation of prior odds:**

If both decks were equally likely to be chosen before observing the cards drawn, then the prior odds are 1:1, or simply 1.

**4. Calculation of posterior odds:**

The posterior odds in favor of Deck A over Deck B given the data (posterior odds) can be computed by multiplying the likelihood ratio by the prior odds: 
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Likelihood ratio} \times \text{Prior odds} \]
\[ \text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
{odds: 4}
