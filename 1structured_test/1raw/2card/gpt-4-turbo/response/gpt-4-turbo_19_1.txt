To determine the posterior odds of selecting deck A versus deck B given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we need to calculate the likelihood of obtaining this observation from each of the decks and then update these beliefs based on the prior probabilities of selecting each deck.

Since the question states that one of the decks was selected by chance, we can assume that the prior probability of selecting deck A, P(A), and deck B, P(B), are both \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Step 1: Calculation of Likelihoods**

_Likelihood for Deck A \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) \):_

In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A can be calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

_Likelihood for Deck B \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) \):_

In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B can be calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 2: Calculation of Posterior Odds**

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are proportional to the product of the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis and the prior odds.

The prior odds for deck A to B are \(\frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1\).

So, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times 1 = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A to deck B are:

{odds: 4}
