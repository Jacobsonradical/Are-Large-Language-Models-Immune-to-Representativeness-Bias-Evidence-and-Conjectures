To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we will apply Bayes' theorem. We first need to calculate the probability of drawing these cards from each deck (the likelihood), multiply by the prior odds, and then form the ratio to find the posterior odds.

**Prior Odds:**
Since either deck could be chosen, the prior probabilities for choosing Deck A or Deck B are equal. Therefore, \(P(\text{Deck A}) = P(\text{Deck B}) = 0.5\). The prior odds are then \(1 : 1\) or simply \(1\).

**Calculating Likelihoods:**
1. **Deck A (2/3 cards are X, 1/3 are O):**
   Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. **Deck B (1/3 cards are X, 2/3 are O):**
   Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**
Using the likelihoods:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \times \text{Prior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times 1 = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observation, are \(4 : 1\).
