To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given the evidence of drawing 3 cards marked 'X' and 1 card marked 'O', we will apply Bayes' theorem and concepts from probability.

First, let's define the probabilities based on the decks:
- For Deck A: \( P(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- For Deck B: \( P(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

**Likelihoods:**
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
  \[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
  \[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Priors:** Since it is not stated otherwise, we assume that the prior probability of choosing either deck is equal:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid 3X, 1O)}{P(B \mid 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B) P(B)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Thus the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \{ "odds": 4 \} \]
