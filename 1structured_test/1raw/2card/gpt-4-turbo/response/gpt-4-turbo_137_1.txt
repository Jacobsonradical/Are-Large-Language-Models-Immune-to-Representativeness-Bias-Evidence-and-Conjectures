To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem to update the likelihood of each deck being chosen given the observed data. 

First, we calculate initial probabilities (prior probabilities) for each deck:
- Probability of choosing Deck A, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of choosing Deck B, \( P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)

Next, we calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck (likelihoods):
- Probability from Deck A (\( P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | A) \)): 
  \[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

- Probability from Deck B (\( P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | B) \)): 
  \[ P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Then we calculate the updated probabilities (posterior probabilities) using the ratio of these probabilities:
- Posterior odds for Deck A vs Deck B is the ratio of these two likelihoods:
  \[ \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | A)}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, based on the observed data of drawing 3 Xâ€™s and 1 O, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
