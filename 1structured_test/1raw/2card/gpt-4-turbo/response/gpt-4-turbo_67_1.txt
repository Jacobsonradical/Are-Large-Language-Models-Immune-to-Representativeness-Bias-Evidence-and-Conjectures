To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from either deck and then determine the ratio of these probabilities for the two decks given the observed outcome. 

The prior probability for choosing either deck A or B is equal \( \frac{1}{2} \) since one of the decks is selected by chance.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) denote the probability of selecting deck A and deck B, respectively. Both are \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Define the event \( E \) as drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We need:
1. \( P(E|A) \) - probability of event E given deck A was chosen.
2. \( P(E|B) \) - probability of event E given deck B was chosen.

Use the binomial probability formula for this, where \( P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \) since in deck A, \( P(X) = 2/3 \) and \( P(O) = 1/3 \).

Hence:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Similarly, for deck B where \( P(X) = 1/3 \) and \( P(O) = 2/3 \):
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds of A to B given E is:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
