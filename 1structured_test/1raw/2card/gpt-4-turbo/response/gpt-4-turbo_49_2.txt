To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given that 3 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O, we use Bayes' theorem and calculate:

Let:
- \( P(\text{Deck } A) = P(\text{Deck } B) = 0.5 \) due to equal chances of selecting either deck.
- Let \( D \) denote the event 3 cards are X and 1 card is O.

We calculate \( P(D \mid \text{Deck } A) \) and \( P(D \mid \text{Deck } B) \):

1. \( P(D \mid \text{Deck } A) \):
   - Drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
   \[ P(D \mid \text{Deck } A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. \( P(D \mid \text{Deck } B) \):
   - Drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
   \[ P(D \mid \text{Deck } B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem and given that \( P(\text{Deck } A) = P(\text{Deck } B) = 0.5 \), the posterior odds ratio, \( O \), is given by:
\[ O = \frac{P(\text{Deck } A \mid D)}{P(\text{Deck } B \mid D)} = \frac{\frac{P(D \mid \text{Deck } A) \cdot P(\text{Deck } A)}{P(D)}}{\frac{P(D \mid \text{Deck } B) \cdot P(\text{Deck } B)}{P(D)}} = \frac{P(D \mid \text{Deck } A)}{P(D \mid \text{Deck } B)} \]

\[ O = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
