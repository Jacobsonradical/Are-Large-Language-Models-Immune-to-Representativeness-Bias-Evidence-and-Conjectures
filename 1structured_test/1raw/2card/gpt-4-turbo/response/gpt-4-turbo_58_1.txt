To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we first calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck:

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is given by the binomial formula:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The prior probability of selecting either deck is 1/2. To find the posterior probability, we use Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds for Deck A versus Deck B can be simplified to the ratio of the likelihoods (since the priors are equal):

\[ \text{Posterior Odds for A:B} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
