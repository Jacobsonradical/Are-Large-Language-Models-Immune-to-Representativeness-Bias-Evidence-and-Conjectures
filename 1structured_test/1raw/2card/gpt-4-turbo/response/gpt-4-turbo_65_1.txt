To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem applied to odds.

First, let's define our events and relevant probabilities:
- \( A \) be the event that Deck A was chosen.
- \( B \) be the event that Deck B was chosen.
- We assume \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) due to a deck being chosen by chance.

Given the above, the prior odds of choosing Deck A over Deck B is:
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1. \]

Next, we calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- For Deck A, \( P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \) since 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O.
- For Deck B, \( P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \) since 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O.

Calculating these probabilities, where \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \):
- \( P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}. \)

- \( P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}. \)

Now, we find the likelihood ratio:
\[ \text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4. \]

Applying this to the prior odds gives,
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio} = 1 \times 4 = 4. \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, are:
\[ \{ \text{odds}: 4 \} \]
