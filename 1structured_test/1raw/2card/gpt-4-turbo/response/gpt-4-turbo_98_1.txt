To solve this question, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the probabilities and then obtain the posterior odds.

1. **Define probabilities for each deck being chosen:**
   Since one of the decks is chosen by chance, the prior probabilities are,
   P(Deck A) = 0.5
   P(Deck B) = 0.5
   
2. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given the deck:**
   - For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
     \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = C(4,3) \cdot (2/3)^3 \cdot (1/3)^1 \]
    \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 4 \cdot 8 / 81 = 32 / 81 \]
   
   - For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
     \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = C(4,3) \cdot (1/3)^3 \cdot (2/3)^1 \]
     \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 4 \cdot 2 / 81 = 8 / 81 \]

3. **Applying Bayes' theorem:**
   Calculate the updated beliefs (posterior probabilities) after seeing the evidence (3X, 1O):
   \[ P(A | Data) = \frac{P(Data | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(Data)} \]
   \[ P(B | Data) = \frac{P(Data | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(Data)} \]
   Where,
   \[ P(Data) = P(Data | A) \cdot P(A) + P(Data | B) \cdot P(B) \]
   \[ P(Data) = (32/81 \cdot 1/2) + (8/81 \cdot 1/2) = (32/162) + (8/162) = 40/162 \]

   Now compute each posterior:
   \[ P(A | Data) = \frac{(32/81) \cdot (1/2)}{(40/162)} = \frac{32/162}{40/162} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]
   \[ P(B | Data) = \frac{(8/81) \cdot (1/2)}{(40/162)} = \frac{8/162}{40/162} = \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \]

4. **Calculate the posterior odds for drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B:**
   \[ Odds(A : B | Data) = \frac{P(A | Data)}{P(B | Data)} \]
   \[ Odds(A : B | Data) = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are given by:

{odds: 4}
