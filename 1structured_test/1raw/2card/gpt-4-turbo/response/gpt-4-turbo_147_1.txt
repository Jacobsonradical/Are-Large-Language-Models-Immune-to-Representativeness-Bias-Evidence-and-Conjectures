To solve this question, we will begin by calculating the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about which deck was chosen based on this evidence.

**Deck A probabilities:**
- Probability of drawing an X in Deck A, P(X|A) = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O in Deck A, P(O|A) = 1/3

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from this setup can be modeled using the binomial formula, focusing on the combination of drawing 3 Xs and then 1 O. The probability we want is expressed as:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 32/81 \]

**Deck B probabilities:**
- Probability of drawing an X in Deck B, P(X|B) = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O in Deck B, P(O|B) = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in Deck B:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 8/81 \]

**Prior probabilities**:
Let's initially assume equal probabilities of picking either deck:
- Prior probability of picking Deck A, P(A) = 1/2
- Prior probability of picking Deck B, P(B) = 1/2

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability ratio is given as:
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B|Data) = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \cdot \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
                          = \frac{32/81}{8/81} \cdot \frac{1/2}{1/2}
                          = 4 \]

Putting it in the required format:
{odds: 4}
