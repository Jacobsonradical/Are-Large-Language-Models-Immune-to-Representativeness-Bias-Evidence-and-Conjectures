To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we must first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck.

Let:
- \( p(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) (probability of drawing an X from Deck A)
- \( p(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \) (probability of drawing an O from Deck A)
- \( p(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) (probability of drawing an X from Deck B)
- \( p(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \) (probability of drawing an O from Deck B)

Since the choice of deck is random, the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are:
- \( p(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( p(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from a deck is \( p(3X, 1O|D) \), which for each deck is given by:

\[ p(3X, 1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]
\[ p(3X, 1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, calculate the posterior odds in favor of Deck A:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{p(3X, 1O|A) \cdot p(A)}{p(3X, 1O|B) \cdot p(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
