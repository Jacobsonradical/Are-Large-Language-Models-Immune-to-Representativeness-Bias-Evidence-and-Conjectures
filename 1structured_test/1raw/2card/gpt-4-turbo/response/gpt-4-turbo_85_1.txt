To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability that deck A was selected given the observation that 3 cards drawn are marked X and 1 card drawn is marked O, and compare it with the probability that deck B was selected given the same observation. We will determine these probabilities and then find the ratio of the two probabilities, which will give us the posterior odds.

**Step 1: Calculate probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck**

- Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A:
  \[
  P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B:
  \[
  P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate prior probability of selecting either deck**
- Both decks are equally likely to be chosen:
  \[
  P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
  \]

**Step 3: Use Bayes' Rule to find the posterior probabilities**
  - For deck A:
    \[
    P(A | \text{3 Xs, 1 O}) = \frac{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | A}) P(A)}{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O})}
    \]

  - For deck B:
    \[
    P(B | \text{3 Xs, 1 O}) = \frac{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | B}) P(B)}{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O})}
    \]

  Where:
  \[
  P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O}) = P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | A}) P(A) + P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | B}) P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{20}{81}
  \]

**Final calculation for posterior odds:**
  \[
  \text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | \text{3 Xs, 1 O})}{P(B | \text{3 Xs, 1 O})} = \frac{\frac{32/81}{20/81}}{\frac{8/81}{20/81}} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
  \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
