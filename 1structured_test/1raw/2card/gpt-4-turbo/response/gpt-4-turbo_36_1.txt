To answer this problem, we use Bayesian probability to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

First, denote:
- \( P(A) \) = probability of having selected Deck A = 0.5 (since a random deck selection implies equal possibilities for Deck A or B)
- \( P(B) \) = probability of having selected Deck B = 0.5

Next, considering the hypergeometric probability for the outcomes given each deck,
- Let \( P(E \mid A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, where the proportion of X's is 2/3; hence, three cards from the 2/3 X’s and one card from the 1/3 O's.
- Let \( P(E \mid B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, where the proportion of X's is 1/3.

Since the deck is very large, we can approximate the draws to follow a binomial distribution (like drawing with replacement). Thus,
- \( P(E \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \) 
- \( P(E \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \)

Calculating the probabilities:
- \( P(E \mid A) = 4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3) = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \)
- \( P(E \mid B) = 4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3) = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 \)

With Bayes’ theorem, we first use it to calculate the posterior probabilities but for odds, the calculation is:
- Odds(A to B) = \( P(A \mid E) / P(B \mid E) = (P(E \mid A) \times P(A)) / (P(E \mid B) \times P(B)) = (P(E \mid A) / P(E \mid B)) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32 / 8 = 4 \).

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:

{odds: 4}
