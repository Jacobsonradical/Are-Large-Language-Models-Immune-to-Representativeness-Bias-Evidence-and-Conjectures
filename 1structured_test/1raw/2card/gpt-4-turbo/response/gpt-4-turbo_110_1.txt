To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given that we have drawn 3 X's and 1 O, we can make use of Bayes' Theorem and work through the likelihoods.

Initially, assume a prior probability of \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) because we randomly choose one deck from the two.

For Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O:
\[ P(\text{XXOX | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O:
\[ P(\text{XXOX | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, apply these likelihoods to Bayes' Theorem to get the posterior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B:

\[ P(\text{A | XXOX}) = \frac{P(\text{XXOX | A})P(A)}{P(\text{XXOX})} \]
\[ P(\text{B | XXOX}) = \frac{P(\text{XXOX | B})P(B)}{P(\text{XXOX})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{XXOX}) = P(\text{XXOX | A})P(A) + P(\text{XXOX | B})P(B) \]
\[ = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{20}{81} \]

Calculate the individual posterior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{A | XXOX}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{B | XXOX}) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior odds ratio:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(\text{A | XXOX})}{P(\text{B | XXOX})} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
