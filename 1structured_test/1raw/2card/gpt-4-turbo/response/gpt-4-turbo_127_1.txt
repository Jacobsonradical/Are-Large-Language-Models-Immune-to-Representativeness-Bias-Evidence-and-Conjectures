To find the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observation of 3 Xs and 1 O, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck and then update our beliefs using prior odds and the newly calculated likelihoods.

**Step 1: Calculate the Prior Odds**
Since it is stated that the decks were chosen by chance, the prior probability for each deck \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\). The prior odds in favor of Deck A versus Deck B are then:
\[ \text{Prior Odds} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods**
- **Deck A Likelihood (\(P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A)\)):**
Deck A has 2/3 of the cards marked X and 1/3 marked O.
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- **Deck B Likelihood (\(P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B)\)):**
Deck B has 1/3 of the cards marked X and 2/3 marked O.
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 3: Calculate Posterior Odds**
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \text{Prior Odds} \times \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds in favor of deck A compared to deck B, given the observation of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, are 4:1.
