To solve this, we start by calculating the probabilities that the given hand (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) comes from Deck A or Deck B.

First, compute the probability that 4 cards drawn from Deck A result in 3 Xs and 1 O:

Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are X, and 1/3 are O. 
The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Then compute the probability for Deck B:

Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are X, and 2/3 are O.
The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

The odds favoring Deck A over Deck B given this hand (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O) are:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
