To solve for the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A versus Deck B, we start by using Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- \( P(A) \) = probability of selecting Deck A = 0.5 (since the deck is chosen randomly)
- \( P(B) \) = probability of selecting Deck B = 0.5
- \( P(X_{3}O_{1} | A) \) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
- \( P(X_{3}O_{1} | B) \) = probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

Given: 
- Deck A has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's 
- Deck B has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's

Using the formula for combinations and independent probabilities for multiple draws (assuming independence and replacement, or sufficiently large decks making sampling without replacement approximately independent), we calculate:

\[ P(X_{3}O_{1} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(X_{3}O_{1} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | X_{3}O_{1}) = \frac{P(X_{3}O_{1} | A) P(A)}{P(X_{3}O_{1})} \]
\[ P(B | X_{3}O_{1}) = \frac{P(X_{3}O_{1} | B) P(B)}{P(X_{3}O_{1})} \]

Where:
\[ P(X_{3}O_{1}) = P(X_{3}O_{1} | A) P(A) + P(X_{3}O_{1} | B) P(B) \]
\[ P(X_{3}O_{1}) = \left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5 + \left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot 0.5 = \frac{20}{81} \]

Thus:
\[ P(A | X_{3}O_{1}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B | X_{3}O_{1}) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \]

The posterior odds favoring Deck A over B are:
\[ \frac{P(A | X_{3}O_{1})}{P(B | X_{3}O_{1})} = \frac{4/5}{1/5} = 4 \]

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
