To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds favoring deck A over deck B given the observed draw.

**1. Define the parameters and likelihoods:**
   - Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of choosing deck A and deck B, respectively. Since one of the decks was chosen by chance, we can assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
   - Let \( X \) denote the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from a deck.

**2. Calculate the likelihoods of drawing the observed hand from each deck:**
   - For deck A (with 2/3 X and 1/3 O):
     - Probability to draw 3 X and 1 O = \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \).

   - For deck B (with 1/3 X and 2/3 O):
     - Probability to draw 3 X and 1 O = \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \).

**3. Calculate the posterior odds:**
   - Posterior odds = (Likelihood of drawing from A) / (Likelihood of drawing from B)
   - Posterior odds = \( \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \).

**Conclusion:**
The posterior odds that the deck is A (higher proportion of Xs) compared to B (higher proportion of Os) given the draw of 3 Xs and 1 O is 4. This means it's four times more likely that the draw came from deck A than from deck B.
