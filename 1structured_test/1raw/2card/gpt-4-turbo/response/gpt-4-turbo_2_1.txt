To solve this question, we first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck (Deck A and Deck B) and then use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities. 

**Probability calculations:**

1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Deck A has 2/3 cards marked X and 1/3 cards marked O.
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (in any order) can be calculated using the combination of binomial probabilities:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Deck B has 1/3 cards marked X and 2/3 cards marked O.
   - Again, use the combination of binomial probabilities:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

**Bayes' Rule application:**
Assuming equal priors for selecting Deck A or B, i.e., \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\) (prior probabilities). We find the posterior odds:

- Posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B based on the observed data:
  \[
  \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) P(A)}{P(\text{data} | B) P(B)}
  \]

  Substituting the probabilities, we have:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
  \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards came from Deck A rather than Deck B are 4.
