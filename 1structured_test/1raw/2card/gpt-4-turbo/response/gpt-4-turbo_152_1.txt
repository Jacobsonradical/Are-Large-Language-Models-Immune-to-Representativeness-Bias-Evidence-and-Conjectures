To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observation of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \(A\) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A, and \(B\) the event they are drawn from Deck B.

First, compute the likelihoods:

1. **Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A** (\(P(X = 3, O = 1 | A)\)):
   - Deck A has 2/3 cards marked X and 1/3 marked O. 
   - The number of ways to draw 3 Xs and 1 O in any order is given by \( \binom{4}{3} \) as there are 4 ways (XXXO, XXOX, XOXX, OXXX).
   - \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \).

2. **Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B** (\(P(X = 3, O = 1 | B)\)):
   - Deck B has 1/3 cards marked X and 2/3 marked O. 
   - \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \).

Next, calculate the prior probabilities:
- Assuming equal probability of selecting either deck, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Now, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{Posterior odds for A vs B} = \frac{P(A|X=3,O=1)}{P(B|X=3,O=1)} = \frac{P(X=3,O=1|A)P(A)}{P(X=3,O=1|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32/81 \cdot 0.5}}{\frac{8/81 \cdot 0.5}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \].

So, the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are: 
{odds: 4}
