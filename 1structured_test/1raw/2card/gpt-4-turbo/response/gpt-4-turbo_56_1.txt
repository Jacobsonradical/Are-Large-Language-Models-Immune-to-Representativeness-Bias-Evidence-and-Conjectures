To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed data, compared to Deck B. We then convert this probability into odds.

1. **Define the probabilities:**
    - Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck was selected by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
    - \( P(X|A) \): probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck A = 2/3
    - \( P(O|A) \): probability of drawing a card marked O from Deck A = 1/3
    - \( P(X|B) \): probability of drawing a card marked X from Deck B = 1/3
    - \( P(O|B) \): probability of drawing a card marked O from Deck B = 2/3

2. **Calculate the likelihood of seeing the data (3 cards X and 1 card O) given Deck A and Deck B:**
    - \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \) because there are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to choose 3 cards of X out of 4:
      \[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = 4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3) = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \times 1/3 = 32/243 \]

    - \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \):
      \[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = 4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3) = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 4/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 \]

3. **Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B:**
    \[
    P(A|\text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O}|A) P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O}|A) P(A) + P(\text{3X, 1O}|B) P(B)}
    \]
    \[
    P(B|\text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O}|B) P(B)}{P(\text{3X, 1O}|A) P(A) + P(\text{3X, 1O}|B) P(B)}
    \]

    Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), we simplify to
    \[ P(A|\text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{32/243}{32/243 + 8/81} = \frac{32/243}{32/243 + 3 \times 32/243} = \frac{32/243}{128/243} = \frac{32}{128} = 1/4\]
    \[ P(B|\text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{8/81}{32/243 + 8/81} = \frac{8/81}{32/243 + 3 \times 32/243} = \frac{8/81}{128/243} = \frac{19.5}{32} = 3/4 \]

4. **The odds ratio for A versus B:**
    \[ \text{Odds for } A = \frac{P(A|\text{3X, 1O})}{P(B|\text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{1/4}{3/4} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, the answer to the question is:
{odds: 1/3}
