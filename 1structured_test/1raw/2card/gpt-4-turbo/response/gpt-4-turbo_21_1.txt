To find the odds that the deck from which the cards were drawn is deck A versus deck B, given the observation of cards, we use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us to find the posterior probability, which will guide us in calculating the posterior odds.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability of Picking Deck A = Probability of Picking Deck B = 1/2

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
     \[(\frac{2}{3})^3 \times (\frac{1}{3}) = \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}\]

   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
     \[(\frac{1}{3})^3 \times (\frac{2}{3}) = \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{81}\]

3. **Compute the posteriors (using Bayes' rule):**
   - Posterior for Deck A = \( \frac{\text{Prior for A} \times \text{Likelihood for A}}{\text{Total Probability}}\)
   - Posterior for Deck B = \( \frac{\text{Prior for B} \times \text{Likelihood for B}}{\text{Total Probability}}\)

   The Total Probability is the sum of the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from either deck:
   \[\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{8 + 2}{162} = \frac{10}{162} = \frac{5}{81}\]

   Thus, the posteriors are:
   - Posterior for Deck A: \(\frac{(\frac{8}{81}) \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{5}{81}} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8\)
   - Posterior for Deck B: \(\frac{(\frac{2}{81}) \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{5}{81}} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2\)

4. **Calculate the posterior odds for Deck A versus Deck B:**
   \[\frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4\]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
