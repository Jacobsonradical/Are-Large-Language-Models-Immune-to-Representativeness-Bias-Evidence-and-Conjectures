To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we begin by using the definition of odds and Bayes' theorem.

Given the prior probability that either Deck A or Deck B was chosen:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

We need to find the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O): \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \)
- For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O): \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \)

Now we calculate the posterior odds, using the likelihoods and prior probabilities:
- \( \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{P(A)P(\text{3X, 1O} | A)}{P(B)P(\text{3X, 1O} | B)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{32}{81}}{0.5 \cdot \frac{8}{81}} \)
- Simplifying, \( \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4.0 \)

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4.0}
