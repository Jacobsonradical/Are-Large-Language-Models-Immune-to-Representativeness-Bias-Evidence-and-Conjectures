First, we calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

**Probability from Deck A, \( P(\text{3 X and 1 O | A}) \)**:
- Since 2/3 of the cards in Deck A are X and 1/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from this deck is given by:
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

**Probability from Deck B, \( P(\text{3 X and 1 O | B}) \)**:
- Since 1/3 of the cards in Deck B are X and 2/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from this deck is given by:
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

**Prior probabilities for each deck (\( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \))**:
- These are equal, as the deck was chosen by chance. Therefore,
  \[
  P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
  \]

**Using Bayes' theorem**:
- The posterior odds of the decks can be calculated using:
  \[
  \text{Odds} = \frac{P(\text{3 X and 1 O | A}) P(A)}{P(\text{3 X and 1 O | B}) P(B)} 
  = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}
  = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}}
  = 4
  \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.

**Answer format:**
`{odds: 4}`
