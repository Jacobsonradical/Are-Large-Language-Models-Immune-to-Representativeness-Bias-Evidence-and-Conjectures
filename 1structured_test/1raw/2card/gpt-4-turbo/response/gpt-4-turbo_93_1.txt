To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the data, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

First, define event \( A \) as choosing Deck A, and event \( B \) as choosing Deck B. We assume the probability of choosing either deck is equal, so \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Let event \( D \) represent the outcome of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We need to compute \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \), the likelihoods of observing this specific outcome given each deck's composition:

1. **Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A**:
   - \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Using the binomial distribution formula \( \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \),
   - \( P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \).

2. **Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B**:
   - \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - \( P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \).

Given these likelihoods, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the odds ratio \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \):

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is 4.
