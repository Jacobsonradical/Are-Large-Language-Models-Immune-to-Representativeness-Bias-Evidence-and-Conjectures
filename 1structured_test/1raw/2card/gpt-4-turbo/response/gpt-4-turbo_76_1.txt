To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards came from Deck A versus Deck B. We start by calculating the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck (Deck A and Deck B).

1. **Likelihood for Deck A:**
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck A, \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck A, \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{1}{3}
     \]

2. **Likelihood for Deck B:**
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck B, \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck B, \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is given by:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{2}{3}
     \]

Calculating these expressions:

- \( P(3X, 1O|A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- \( P(3X, 1O|B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \)

3. **Calculating the Posterior Odds:**
   Before we consider the likelihoods, let's assume that each deck had an equal prior probability of being chosen, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \). This means the posterior odds ratio \( \frac{P(A|data)}{P(B|data)} \) equals the likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(3X, 1O|A)}{P(3X, 1O|B)} \).

   \[
   \text{Odds ratio} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4. 

So, the formatted answer is:

{odds: 4}
