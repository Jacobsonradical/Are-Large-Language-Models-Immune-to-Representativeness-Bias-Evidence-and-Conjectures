First, let us define a few probabilities:

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the probabilities of selecting deck A and deck B, respectively.

Given that it is equally likely to select either deck:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Let \( D \) be the data observed: drawing 3 cards marked \( X \) and 1 card marked \( O \).

We need to calculate the probabilities of observing this data given each deck:
- \( P(D \mid A) \): the probability of drawing 3 cards marked \( X \) and 1 marked \( O \) from deck A.
- \( P(D \mid B) \): the probability of drawing 3 cards marked \( X \) and 1 marked \( O \) from deck B.

### Calculating \( P(D \mid A) \)
Deck A has 2/3 of cards marked \( X \) and 1/3 marked \( O \).
The probability of drawing 3 \( X \) and 1 \( O \) from deck A, denoting the number of ways to arrange 3 \( X \)'s and 1 \( O \) in 4 draws is:
\[ P(D \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D \mid A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(D \mid B) \)
Deck B has 1/3 of cards marked \( X \) and 2/3 marked \( O \):
\[ P(D \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ P(D \mid B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Calculating the Posterior Odds for Deck A versus Deck B
Now, using Bayes' rule and the odds formula:
\[ \text{Odds}(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A)\, P(A)}{P(D \mid B)\, P(B)} \]
Given \( P(A) = P(B) \), this simplifies to:
\[ \text{Odds}(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A)}{P(D \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

### Answer
{odds: 4}
