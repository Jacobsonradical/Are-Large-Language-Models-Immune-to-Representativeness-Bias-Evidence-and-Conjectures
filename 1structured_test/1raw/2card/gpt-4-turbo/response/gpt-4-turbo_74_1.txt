To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observed data, we use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. We begin by calculating the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O from each deck.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the prior probability of choosing Deck A;
- \( P(B) \) be the prior probability of choosing Deck B;
- \( P(\text{data} \mid A) \) be the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A;
- \( P(\text{data} \mid B) \) be the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.

Assuming that deck A or B is equally likely to be chosen initially, we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

The likelihoods given each deck are calculated as follows, using the combinations formula for drawing the cards:

For Deck A (2/3 cards are X, 1/3 are O):
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 cards are X, 2/3 are O):
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem to update our probabilities based on the observed evidence (conditional probabilities):
\[ P(A \mid \text{data}) \propto P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A) \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{data}) \propto P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B) \]

To find posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds for A to B} = \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, based on seeing 3 X's and 1 O's is 4 to 1.

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
