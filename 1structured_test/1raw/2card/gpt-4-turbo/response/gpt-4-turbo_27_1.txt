To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observation that three cards drawn were marked X and one was marked O, we first need to compute the probabilities of this observation under each deck hypothesis.

Let \( p_A \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and \( p_B \) be the probability of drawing the same from Deck B.

**Deck A**: 
In Deck A, where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O, the probability of drawing 3 Xâ€™s and 1 O from a deck can be modeled using a binomial distribution:
\[ p_A = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ p_A = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ p_A = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ p_A = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Deck B**: 
In Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O, the corresponding probability is:
\[ p_B = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ p_B = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ p_B = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ p_B = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now compute the posterior odds in favor of Deck A (more X's):
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{p_A}{p_B} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B is 4:1, given the observation.

{odds: 4}
