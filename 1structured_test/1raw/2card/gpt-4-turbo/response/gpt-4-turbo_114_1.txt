To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given the data of drawing 3 cards with X and 1 card with O, we follow these steps:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( D_A \) be the event that Deck A was chosen.
   - Let \( D_B \) be the event that Deck B was chosen.
   - Let \( E \) be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

2. **Calculate Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, \( P(E \mid D_A) \):
     \[
     P(E \mid D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, \( P(E \mid D_B) \):
     \[
     P(E \mid D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Prior Probabilities:**
   Assume that each deck has an equal probability of being selected:
   \[
   P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5
   \]

4. **Calculate Posterior Odds:**
   Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of \( D_A \) to \( D_B \) given \( E \) are formulated as:
   \[
   \frac{P(D_A \mid E)}{P(D_B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid D_A) \cdot P(D_A)}{P(E \mid D_B) \cdot P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are 4. 

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:
{odds: 4}
