To solve this, we need to calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) represent deck A and \( B \) represent deck B. Let \( X \) represent the observation of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

First, we need to find the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

1. **Probability of drawing from deck A** (\( P(D = A) \)) = \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since we select one of the decks randomly).

2. **Probability of drawing from deck B** (\( P(D = B) \)) = \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A**:

   \[
   P(X \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

4. **Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B**:

   \[
   P(X \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

5. **Apply Bayes' theorem** to find the posterior probabilities:
   
   \[
   P(D = A \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid A) P(D = A)}{P(X \mid A) P(D = A) + P(X \mid B) P(D = B)}
   \]

   \[
   P(D = A \mid X) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

   \[
   P(D = B \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid B) P(D = B)}{P(X \mid A) P(D = A) + P(X \mid B) P(D = B)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

6. **Calculate the posterior odds** of deck A to deck B:

   \[
   \frac{P(D = A \mid X)}{P(D = B \mid X)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4
   \]

So the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are:

{odds: 4}
