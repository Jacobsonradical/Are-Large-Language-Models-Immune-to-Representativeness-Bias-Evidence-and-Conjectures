To determine the posterior odds that Deck A was selected given the observed cards, we start by calculating the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck A was chosen, and the same probability given that Deck B was chosen. We then use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on the observed data.

**Calculate the Likelihoods:**

1. **Probability of choosing Deck A (P(A)) and Deck B (P(B)):**
   Since both decks are equally likely to be chosen, \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\).

2. **Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P(X=3, O=1 | A)):**
   - \(P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3}\) (probability of drawing X from Deck A)
   - \(P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3}\) (probability of drawing O from Deck A)
   Using the binomial formula:
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

3. **Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (P(X=3, O=1 | B)):**
   - \(P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3}\) (probability of drawing X from Deck B)
   - \(P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3}\) (probability of drawing O from Deck B)
   Using the binomial formula:
   \[
   P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

**Calculate the Posterior Odds:**
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4
\]

Thus the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.

**Final Answer:**
```
{odds: 4}
