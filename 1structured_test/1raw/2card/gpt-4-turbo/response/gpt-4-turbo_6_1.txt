To solve this, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck (Deck A and Deck B) and then use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about which deck is more likely to have been the source of the drawn cards.

### Step 1: Calculate probabilities for each deck
Let \( P(X=3, O=1 | A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. Since Deck A has 2/3 of its cards marked X, and 1/3 of its cards marked O, this probability is calculated using the binomial formula:

\[
P(X=3, O=1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
\]

Now for Deck B, where 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O, \( P(X=3, O=1 | B) \):

\[
P(X=3, O=1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
\]

### Step 2: Use Bayes' theorem
Assuming the prior probability \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) because one of the decks is randomly selected, and using Bayes' theorem, we then update our beliefs based on the evidence (drawing 3 X's and 1 O):

\[
P(A | X=3, O=1) = \frac{P(X=3, O=1 | A) \times P(A)}{P(X=3, O=1 | A) \times P(A) + P(X=3, O=1 | B) \times P(B)}
\]

\[
= \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \times 0.5}
\]

\[
= \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A is:

\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{P(A | X=3, O=1)}{P(B | X=3, O=1)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{1 - \frac{4}{5}} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]

### Answer:
Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A, as opposed to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
