To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A rather than deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we first need to calculate the likelihood of this specific outcome under each deck scenario, and then use Bayes' rule.

**Likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A**:
Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards are X and \( \frac{1}{3} \) are O. The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, in any order, from deck A is calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B**:
Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards are X and \( \frac{2}{3} \) are O. The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, in any order, from deck B is:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Prior Odds**:
Assuming no prior preference for one deck over the other, the prior odds \( P(A) : P(B) \) are 1:1.

**Bayes' Rule application**:
The posterior odds are given by multiplying the likelihood ratios by the prior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \left(\frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)}\right) \times (\text{Prior Odds for A:B}) = \left(\frac{32/81}{8/81}\right) \times 1 = 4:1 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B is 4. There is 4 times more likelihood to draw such a combination from Deck A than from Deck B.

**Answer**:
{odds: 4}
