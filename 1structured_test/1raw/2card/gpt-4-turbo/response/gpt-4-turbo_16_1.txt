To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observation of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we can use Bayes' theorem and consider the data generation process.

1. Probabilities of obtaining the observed sequence (3 X's, 1 O) from each deck:
    - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
      \[
      P(\text{3 X's, 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
      \]
    - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
      \[
      P(\text{3 X's, 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
      \]

2. Prior odds, assuming there is no prior knowledge favoring one deck over the other:
    - Prior odds of A to B = 1:1, or as a probability, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

3. Using Bayes' theorem:
   - Posterior odds of A to B = Prior odds of A to B Ã— Ratio of the likelihoods of the data under A vs. B:
     \[
     \text{Posterior odds (A:B)} = 1 \times \frac{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O | A})}{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O | B})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
