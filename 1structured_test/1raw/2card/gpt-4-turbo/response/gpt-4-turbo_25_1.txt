To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context relates the probability of selecting a deck given an observed outcome (in our scenario, the observed outcome is drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O).

1. **Define the probabilities from the problem:**
   - Let \( \Pr(\text{Deck } A) = \Pr(\text{Deck } B) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since it's equally likely to choose either deck).
   - In Deck A, the probability of drawing a card marked X is \( \Pr(X | A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and O is \( \Pr(O | A) = \frac{1}{3} \).
   - In Deck B, the probability of drawing a card marked X is \( \Pr(X | B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and O is \( \Pr(O | B) = \frac{2}{3} \).

2. **Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:**
   - Probability (3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = \(\binom{4}{3}\) \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3\) \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1\)
   - Probability (3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = \(\binom{4}{3}\) \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\) \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1\)

   Here, \(\binom{4}{3}\) is the combinatorial for choosing 3 X's out of 4 cards drawn, which equals 4.

   - Probability (3 X's and 1 O from Deck A) = \(4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}\)
   - Probability (3 X's and 1 O from Deck B) = \(4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}\)

3. **Use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior odds:**
   \[
   \frac{\Pr(\text{Deck } A | \text{Data})}{\Pr(\text{Deck } B | \text{Data})} = \frac{\Pr(\text{Data} | \text{Deck } A) \times \Pr(\text{Deck } A)}{\Pr(\text{Data} | \text{Deck } B) \times \Pr(\text{Deck } B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards drawn were from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4. This means it's 4 times as likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B given the observed data of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Thus the answer is:
{odds: 4}
