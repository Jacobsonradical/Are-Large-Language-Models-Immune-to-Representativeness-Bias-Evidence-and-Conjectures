To solve this, we use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about the deck from which the cards were drawn based on the evidence of the drawn cards.

Let \( A \) denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and \( B \) denote the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We start with the prior odds, which are even (1:1) since one of the decks is chosen at random:
\[ \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \]

We need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck. To do this, we use the binomial coefficient to account for the different ways to arrange the X's and O's among the drawn cards. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, we calculate the likelihood ratio:
\[ \text{Likelihood Ratio} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Finally, since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds are just the likelihood ratio:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \text{Likelihood Ratio} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
