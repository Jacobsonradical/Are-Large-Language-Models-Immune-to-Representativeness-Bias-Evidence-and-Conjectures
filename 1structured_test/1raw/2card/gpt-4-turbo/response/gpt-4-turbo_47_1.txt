To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem, which involves calculating and comparing the likelihoods of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck. Let us calculate these probabilities first:

1. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck A: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck A: 1/3
   - Using the binomial probability formula \(P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)}\) for \(n = 4\), \(k = 3\), \(p = 2/3\),
   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{1} = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}.
   \]

2. Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck B: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck B: 2/3
   - Using the binomial probability formula for \(p = 1/3\),
   \[
   P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1} = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}.
   \]

Since both decks were equally likely to be chosen initially (prior probabilities P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), the posterior odds are calculated based on the likelihoods \(P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A})\) and \(P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B})\):

\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A})}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4.
\]

Thus the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
