To solve this problem, we need to update our beliefs about the probability that the cards came from Deck A given the observed outcomes using Bayes' rule. We start by calculating the likelihoods of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O from each deck:

1. **Probability for Deck A (PA):**
   \( P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \)
   \( = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 4 \times 8/81 = 32/81 \)

2. **Probability for Deck B (PB):**
   \( P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \)
   \( = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 4 \times 2/81 = 8/81 \)

Next, letâ€™s consider that initially, it is equally likely that either deck was chosen, so \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probability for each deck given the evidence (Posterior probability = \( \frac{Prior \times Likelihood}{Evidence} \)) can be calculated and compared. However, for the direct approach, just comparing the likelihoods (because the priors are equal) will determine the posterior odds.

**Posterior odds for Deck A to Deck B use the ratio of respective probabilities (A's likelihood to B's likelihood):**
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B) = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | A)}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O} | B)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

thus:
