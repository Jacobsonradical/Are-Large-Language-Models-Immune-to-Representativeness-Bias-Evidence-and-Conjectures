To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we first need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then update our beliefs (priors) using Bayes' Theorem. Since no specific prior probability is mentioned, we'll assume the prior odds of choosing either deck are equal, i.e., the prior probability for both decks is 1/2.

1. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:**
   - Probability of X in Deck A = 2/3
   - Probability of O in Deck A = 1/3
   - Since the order doesn't matter, use the combination formula for choosing 3 X's out of 4 draws:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:**
   - Probability of X in Deck B = 1/3
   - Probability of O in Deck B = 2/3
   - Similarly:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Calculate the posterior odds:**
   - Assuming prior odds of 1:1, the Bayes factor (likelihood ratio) for Deck A to Deck B is:
     \[
     \text{Bayes factor} = \frac{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A})}{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B})} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4
     \]
   - Since the prior odds are 1:1, the posterior odds are simply the Bayes factor, which is 4:1 in favor of Deck A.

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is **4**.
