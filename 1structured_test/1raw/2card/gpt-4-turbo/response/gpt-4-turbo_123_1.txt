To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to-find the probability that the deck chosen was A (where most cards are marked X) given the specific drawing of 3 X's and 1 O.

Let:
- \( A \) denote the event that Deck A was chosen.
- \( B \) denote the event that Deck B was chosen.
- \( D \) denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Using the given information:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) ("one of the decks has been selected by chance")
- \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

We need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):
- \( P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- \( P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \)

Next, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The normalization factor \( P(D) \) (or marginal probability of D) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{32+8}{162} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

Hence,
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Finally, the posterior odds in favor of A compared to B is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{4/5}{1/5} = 4 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
