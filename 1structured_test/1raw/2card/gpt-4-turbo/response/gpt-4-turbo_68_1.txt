To solve this, we use Bayes' Theorem for conditional probability, and we need to compute the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck.

Let:
- \(A\) be the event that Deck A was chosen.
- \(B\) be the event that Deck B was chosen.
- \(D\) be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior odds of \(A\) to \(B\) given \(D\) as:
\[
\frac{P(A \mid D)}{P(B \mid D)} = \frac{P(D \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(D \mid B) \times P(B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Given \(P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\) (since one deck is chosen at random), the prior odds \(P(A)/P(B) = 1\). So,
\[
\frac{P(A \mid D)}{P(B \mid D)} = \frac{P(D \mid A)}{P(D \mid B)}
\]

We compute \(P(D \mid A)\) and \(P(D \mid B)\) as follows:

1. **Probability from Deck A (\(P(D \mid A)\))**: 
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which has 2/3 X's and 1/3 O's, calculated using the binomial probability formula:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

2. **Probability from Deck B (\(P(D \mid B)\))**: 
   - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B, which has 1/3 X's and 2/3 O's:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

Finally, the posterior odds:
\[
\frac{P(D \mid A)}{P(D \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
