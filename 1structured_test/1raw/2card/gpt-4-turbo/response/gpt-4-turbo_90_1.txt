To compute the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observed data (drawing 3 Xs and 1 O), we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B respectively. Since one deck is chosen at random, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).
- \( P(3X, 1O \mid A) \) and \( P(3X, 1O \mid B) \), the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Decks A and B, respectively.

The probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \]

\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = 4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = 4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 \]

Now, using Bayes' Rule, the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A to Deck B, given the evidence, is:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid 3X, 1O)}{P(B \mid 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B) P(B)} = \frac{(32/81) \times (1/2)}{(8/81) \times (1/2)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4 \]

This means the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A are 4 times greater than from Deck B.

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
