To determine the posterior odds that deck A was chosen over deck B given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we first use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event "deck A was chosen".
- \( B \) be the event "deck B was chosen".
- \( D \) be the observed data "drawing 3 Xs and 1 O".

We want to find the posterior odds \(\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)}\).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D)}
\]
and
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B)P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

Because decks A and B are equally likely to be chosen,
\[
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5
\]

The probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck (the likelihoods) are:
\[
P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]
\[
P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

So, the posterior odds are:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
