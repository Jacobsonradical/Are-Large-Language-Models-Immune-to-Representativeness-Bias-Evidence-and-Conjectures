To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to perform a Bayesian analysis.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Let P(A) = 0.5 (probability it is deck A)
   - Let P(B) = 0.5 (probability it is deck B)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
     \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times (8/27) \times (1/3) = 32/81 \]
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
     \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times (1/27) \times (2/3) = 8/81 \]

3. **Using Bayes' Rule**:
   \[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A) \times P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(B) \times P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{0.5 \times 32/81}{0.5 \times 8/81} \]

4. **Calculate**:
   \[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 32/8 = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
