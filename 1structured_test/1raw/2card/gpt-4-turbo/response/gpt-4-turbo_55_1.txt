To solve this problem, we first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in four trials from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the odds based on the observed evidence. 

The prior odds of selecting Deck A vs. Deck B is 1:1 because one deck is selected at random (Deck A = Deck B is a 50% chance).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O (in no specific order) from a deck can be analyzed using the binomial distribution formula P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n, k) is the combination function which computes how many ways there are to choose k successes in n trials.

1. **Probability from Deck A**:
   - Deck A Probability, X = 2/3, O = 1/3
   - Drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} 
     \]
   
2. **Probability from Deck B**:
   - Deck B Probability, X = 1/3, O = 2/3
   - Drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

Using these probabilities, we can now calculate the odds ratio favoring Deck A over Deck B:

\[
\text{Odds ratio} = \frac{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A})}{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given as:

{odds: 4}
