To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we'll first calculate the likelihoods of observing the sequence of 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, respectively. We will then use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on these likelihoods.

### Step 1: Prior probabilities
Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability of choosing Deck A (and similarly \( P(B) = 1 - P(A) \) for Deck B).
- Because the deck is chosen by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

### Step 2: Likelihoods of observing 3 X's and 1 O
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
  \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 32/81 \]
  
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
  \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 8/81 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Posterior Odds using Bayes' Rule
\[ \text{Odds}(A|data) = \frac{P(data|A) P(A)}{P(data|B) P(B)} \]
Since \( P(A) = P(B) \), this reduces to:
\[ \text{Odds}(A|data) = \frac{P(data|A)}{P(data|B)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4 \]

### Conclusion
The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B is 4.

Thus:
{odds: 4}
