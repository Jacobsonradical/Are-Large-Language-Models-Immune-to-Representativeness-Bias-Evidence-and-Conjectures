To solve for the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the prior probability of picking Deck A, and similarly \( P(B) \) for Deck B. Since the deck is chosen randomly, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X|A) \) be the probability of drawing X from Deck A, \( P(O|A) \) be the probability of drawing O from Deck A.
- \( P(X|B) \) be the probability of drawing X from Deck B, \( P(O|B) \) be the probability of drawing O from Deck B.

From the problem:
- \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \), \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \), \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

We observed 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We need to calculate the likelihood of this observation under each hypothesis (Deck A or B):
- \( P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- \( P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \)

Now compute the posterior odds:
- The odds of A over B given the evidence = \( \frac{P(A|3X, 1O)}{P(B|3X, 1O)} \)
- Using Bayesâ€™ rule and noting prior odds \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \):
  \( \frac{P(A|3X, 1O)}{P(B|3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O|A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \)

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
