To solve this problem, we first compute the likelihoods of drawing 3 cards marked 'X' and 1 card marked 'O' from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the odds given the new information.

**Step 1: Compute Likelihoods**
Let's denote:
- \( p_A(X) = \frac{2}{3} \) as the probability of drawing an X from deck A
- \( p_A(O) = \frac{1}{3} \) as the probability of drawing an O from deck A
- \( p_B(X) = \frac{1}{3} \) as the probability of drawing an X from deck B
- \( p_B(O) = \frac{2}{3} \) as the probability of drawing an O from deck B

We assume that draws are independent. We need to calculate:
- \( L(A \mid data) \) = likelihood of getting the data from deck A: \( \binom{4}{3} \cdot (p_A(X))^3 \cdot p_A(O) \)
- \( L(B \mid data) \) = likelihood of getting the data from deck B: \( \binom{4}{3} \cdot (p_B(X))^3 \cdot p_B(O) \)

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) represents the number of ways to choose which 3 out of 4 cards are Xs.

Calculating these values:
- \( L(A \mid data) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- \( L(B \mid data) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \)

**Step 2: Calculate Prior Odds**
Since the problem states that one of the decks is chosen by chance, we assume:
- Priors \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

**Step 3: Update Odds using Bayes Theorem**
The posterior odds \(\frac{P(A \mid data)}{P(B \mid data)}\) is proportional to the likelihood ratio times the prior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid data)}{P(B \mid data)} = \frac{L(A \mid data)}{L(B \mid data)} \cdot \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \cdot \frac{1}{1} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]
