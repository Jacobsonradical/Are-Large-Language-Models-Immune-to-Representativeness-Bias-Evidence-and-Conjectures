To calculate the posterior odds favoring deck A versus deck B, we first consider the relevant probabilities.

1. **Prior Odds**: Since one deck is selected by chance, the odds that either deck A or B is chosen are equal. The prior odds ratio is therefore 1 (as the probability is 50% each).

2. **Likelihood of Observing the Sequence (3 X's and 1 O)**:

   - For deck A:
     - Probability of drawing X from deck A = 2/3.
     - Probability of drawing O from deck A = 1/3.
     - Hence, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from deck A = \( \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 4 \times 8/81 = 32/81 \).

   - For deck B:
     - Probability of drawing X from deck B = 1/3.
     - Probability of drawing O from deck B = 2/3.
     - Hence, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from deck B = \( \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 4 \times 2/81 = 8/81 \).

3. **Likelihood Ratio**: 
   - This is the ratio of the probabilities calculated above: \( \frac{P(3X,1O|A)}{P(3X,1O|B)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 32/8 = 4 \).

4. **Posterior Odds**:
   - Obtained by multiplying prior odds by the likelihood ratio. Since the prior odds are 1, the posterior odds = 1 Ã— 4 = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A rather than deck B are:

{odds: 4}
