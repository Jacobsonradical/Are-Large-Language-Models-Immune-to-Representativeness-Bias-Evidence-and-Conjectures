To solve this problem, we will use Bayesian updating to determine the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B given the observed data.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Because one of the decks is randomly chosen, the prior probabilities for choosing Deck A or Deck B are both \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Deck A**: The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is calculated from the binomial distribution:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - **Deck B**: The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O:
     \[
     P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Calculating Posterior Odds**:
   - The posterior odds are given by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds (A:B)} = \frac{P(\text{A})}{P(\text{B})} \times \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A})}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B})} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

**Result**:
The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B are 4:1. In the required format:

{odds: 4}
