To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B.

1. **Define the likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (P(data | A)): 
     \[
     P(data | A) = {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (P(data | B)):
     \[
     P(data | B) = {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

2. **Define the priors**:
   - Since one deck is chosen by chance, we assume:
     \[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

3. **Compute the posterior probabilities**:
   - By using Bayes' Rule:
     \[
     \frac{P(A | data)}{P(B | data)} = \frac{P(data | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(data | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4
     \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
