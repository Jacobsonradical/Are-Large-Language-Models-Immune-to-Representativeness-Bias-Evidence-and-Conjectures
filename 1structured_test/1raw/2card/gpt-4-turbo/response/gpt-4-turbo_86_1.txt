To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). We start by calculating the likelihood of observing this outcome from each deck and then use these likelihoods to compute the odds.

We are given:
- **Deck A**: 2/3 cards are X, 1/3 are O.
- **Deck B**: 1/3 cards are X, 2/3 are O.

Denote \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since one of the decks is chosen at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, using the binomial probability formula:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from **Deck A**:
  \[
  P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
  = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from **Deck B**:
  \[
  P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
  = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Now, apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the posterior odds:
\[
\text{Odds}(A \text{ given data}) = \frac{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | A}) \times P(A)}{P(\text{3 X, 1 O | B}) \times P(B)}
\]
\[
= \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}
= \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}}
= \frac{32}{8}
= 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
