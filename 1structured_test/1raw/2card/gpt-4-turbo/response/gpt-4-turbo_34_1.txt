To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for each deck given the observation (drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card) and then convert these probabilities into odds.

1. Calculation of the prior probability:
   Let \( A \) denote the event that deck A was chosen, and \( B \) the event that deck B was chosen.
   Since the deck is chosen by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

2. Calculation of the likelihood:
   The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
   - Deck A: \( P(\text{3 X and 1 O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \).

   The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
   - Deck B: \( P(\text{3 X and 1 O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \).

3. Application of Bayes' Theorem:
   Posterior probability for Deck A given the draw:
   \[ P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = \frac{P(\text{3 X and 1 O | A})P(A)}{P(\text{3 X and 1 O | A})P(A) + P(\text{3 X and 1 O | B})P(B)} \]
   \[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
   \[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{32}{81} + \frac{8}{81}} \]
   \[ = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]

   Posterior probability for Deck B given the draw:
   \[ P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = 0.2 \]

4. Convert the probabilities to odds:
   \( \text{Odds of A to B} = \frac{P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O})}{P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O})} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \).

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
