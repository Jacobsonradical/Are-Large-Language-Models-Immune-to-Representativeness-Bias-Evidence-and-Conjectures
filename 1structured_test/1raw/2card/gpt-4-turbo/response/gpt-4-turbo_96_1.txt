To solve this, we use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs about which deck the cards were drawn from, based on the observed data.

Let:
- \(A\) be the event that deck A was chosen.
- \(B\) be the event that deck B was chosen.
- \(E\) be the evidence event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

We are asked to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

We will use the formula for Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E)} \]
and similarly for \( P(B|E) \).

Since decks A and B were equally likely to be chosen:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

The evidence probabilities given each deck are calculated using the binomial formula \( \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( k \) is the number of successes, and \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial.
- For deck A, \( P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \)
- For deck B, \( P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 \)

Now, \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) = (32/81)(0.5) + (8/81)(0.5) = 16/81 + 4/81 = 20/81 \]

The posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{32/81 \times 0.5}{20/81} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{8/81 \times 0.5}{20/81} = \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \]

Finally, the posterior odds in favor of A compared to B are:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
