To determine the posterior odds, we need to first calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck and then use Bayes' formula to update our beliefs based on the evidence. 

Suppose \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the prior probabilities of choosing deck A and deck B, respectively. Since it’s said that one of the decks is chosen by chance, we assume these priors are equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let \( E \) represent the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

### Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A: 
- Deck A: 2/3 cards are X and 1/3 are O.
- The probability of getting exactly 3 X's and 1 O in a draw of 4 cards can be computed by the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

### Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
- Deck B: 1/3 cards are X and 2/3 are O.
- The corresponding probability calculation:

\[
P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

### Bayes’ Theorem:
The posterior odds can be found by using the formula \(\frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)}\), however a simpler way is to compute the odds directly:

\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{P(E | A) P(A)}{P(E | B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
