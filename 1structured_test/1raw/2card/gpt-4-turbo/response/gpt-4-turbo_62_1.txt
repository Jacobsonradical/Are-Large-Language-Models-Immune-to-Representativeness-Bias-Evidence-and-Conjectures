We start by calculating the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O from each deck:

1. Probability from Deck A (2/3 cards are X, 1/3 cards are O):
   \[
   P(\text{3X, 1O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \approx 0.3951
   \]

2. Probability from Deck B (1/3 cards are X, 2/3 cards are O):
   \[
   P(\text{3X, 1O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \approx 0.0988
   \]

Given that either deck could have been selected initially, the prior probabilities for each deck, \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\), are both \(1/2\).

Now, calculate the posterior odds of Deck A given the event (E = 3X, 1O):
\[
\text{Posterior odds of A to B} = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O | A}) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O | B}) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
