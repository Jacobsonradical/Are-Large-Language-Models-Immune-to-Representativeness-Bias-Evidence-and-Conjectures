To solve this problem, we'll begin by using Bayes' theorem and the model of conditional probabilities to determine the posterior odds for choosing each deck based on the observed evidence (three Xs and one O). 

**Step 1: Define probabilities based on problem statement**
- Deck A: P(X) = 2/3, P(O) = 1/3
- Deck B: P(X) = 1/3, P(O) = 2/3

**Step 2: Calculate probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck**
For a given sequence, we can use the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(C|D_j) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]
where \( n \) is the total number of draws, \( k \) is the number of successes (drawing X), \( p \) is the probability of drawing X from deck \( j \), and \( D_j \) is the deck being considered.

Given that the order in which cards are drawn doesn't matter in this context, the probability formula simplifies to considering combinations of drawing cards:
- For Deck A: \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \)
- For Deck B: \( P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \)

**Step 3: Assume equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck**
Let's assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) since the choice of deck is random.

**Step 4: Calculate posterior odds**
\[ \text{Posterior odds for Deck A vs. Deck B} = \frac{P(A | \text{Data})}{P(B | \text{Data})} = \frac{P(\text{Data} | A)P(A)}{P(\text{Data} | B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
