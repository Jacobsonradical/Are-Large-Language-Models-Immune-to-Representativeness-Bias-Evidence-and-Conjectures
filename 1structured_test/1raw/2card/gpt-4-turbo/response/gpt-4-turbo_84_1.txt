First, let's summarize the probabilities:

For Deck A:
- Probability of X: \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of O: \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)

For Deck B:
- Probability of X: \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of O: \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Given that 3 cards are X and 1 card is O, the likelihood of drawing these cards from Deck A and Deck B are:

For Deck A:
\[ P(3X, 1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(3X, 1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem and considering equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), we calculate the posterior odds in favor of Deck A vs. Deck B based on the observed data of 3X, 1O.

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|3X, 1O)}{P(B|3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O|A) \times P(A)}{P(3X, 1O|B) \times P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
