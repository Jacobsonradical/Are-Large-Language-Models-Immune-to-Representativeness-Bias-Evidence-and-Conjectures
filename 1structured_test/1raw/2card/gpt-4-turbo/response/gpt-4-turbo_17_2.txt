To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) compared to Deck B (where most cards are marked O), we start by using the Bayes' Theorem, specifically focusing on determining the likelihood of seeing the observed data under each hypothesis, and then adjusting these likelihoods by the prior probabilities of each deck being chosen.

Given:
- Probability a randomly chosen deck is A or B (prior probabilities) = 1/2 each (since one deck is chosen at random).

From Deck A (with 2/3 cards marked X and 1/3 marked O):
- Probability of drawing 3 cards with X and 1 card with O = (Combination(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1) 
  = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81.

From Deck B (with 1/3 cards marked X and 2/3 marked O):
- Probability of drawing 3 cards with X and 1 card with O = (Combination(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1)
  = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81.

The likelihood ratio (Deck A's likelihood to Deck B's likelihood) is therefore:
- (32/81) / (8/81) = 32 / 8 = 4.

Since the prior odds (probabilities of choosing Deck A vs. Deck B) are 1:1 or equal, the posterior odds equal the likelihood ratio, which is 4:1.

Expressed as a single number:
{odds: 4}
