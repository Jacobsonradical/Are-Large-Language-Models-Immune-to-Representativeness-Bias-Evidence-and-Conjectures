Let's compute the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then find the posterior odds favoring Deck A.

1. **Probability of drawing from Deck A**:
   - The probability of drawing an X in Deck A is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing an O in Deck A is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: 
     \[
     \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. **Probability of drawing from Deck B**:
   - The probability of drawing an X in Deck B is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing an O in Deck B is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
     \[
     \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Posterior odds calculation**:
   - Assuming the prior odds of selecting Deck A vs. Deck B are equal (1:1), the posterior odds are given by the likelihood ratio:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Likelihood of Deck A}}{\text{Likelihood of Deck B}} 
     = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} 
     = \frac{32}{8} 
     = 4
     \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
