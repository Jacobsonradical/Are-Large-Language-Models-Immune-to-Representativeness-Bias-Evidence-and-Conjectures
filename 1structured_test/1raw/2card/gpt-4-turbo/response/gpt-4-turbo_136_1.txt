To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we use Bayes' Theorem. First, let us compute the necessary probabilities:

1. **Probability of choosing Deck A (P(A))** = 1/2 
2. **Probability of choosing Deck B (P(B))** = 1/2

Next, we calculate the likelihoods:
- For **Deck A** (where 2/3 of cards are X and 1/3 are O):
  - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A: 
    \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

- For **Deck B** (where 1/3 of cards are X and 2/3 are O):
  - Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B: 
    \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now we apply Bayesâ€™ Rule to weigh these probabilities against the prior odds:

- Prior odds of A to B:
  \[ \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1 \]

- Calculation of posterior odds:
  \[ \text{Posterior Odds of A to B} = \text{Prior odds} \times \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that deck A was selected compared to deck B are 4:1.
