To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, let's first define our events and then calculate the relevant probabilities:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Deck A was selected.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Deck B was selected.
- Let \( D \) be the data, the event that 3 cards drawn are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Since A and B are equally likely to be selected, we have \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \), the probabilities of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O given the choice of deck A or deck B:

1. From Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - So, \( P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \).

2. From Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - So, \( P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \).

Now, by using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given data D, is:

\[
\frac{P(A | D)}{P(B | D)} = \frac{P(D | A) P(A)}{P(D | B) P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4.
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
