**Solution:** 

To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O), we first need to calculate the likelihoods of drawing these cards from each deck. Then, we apply Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs (priors) based on the evidence (data).

1. **Prior probability (Priors):**
   - There was initially a 50% chance for each deck being chosen. So, \( P(\text{Deck A}) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\text{Deck B}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:**

   - **Deck A:** Probability for X = 2/3, Probability for O = 1/3.
     
     \[ P(\text{3 X and 1 O | Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

   - **Deck B:** Probability for X = 1/3, Probability for O = 2/3.
     
     \[ P(\text{3 X and 1 O | Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

3. **Bayes' Rule to find Posterior Odds:**

   - The posterior odds ratio in favor of Deck A over Deck B given our data can be calculated using:

   \[
   \text{Odds} = \frac{P(\text{Deck A | Data})}{P(\text{Deck B | Data})} = \frac{P(\text{Data | Deck A}) P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{Data | Deck B}) P(\text{Deck B})}
   \]

   Plugging in values:

   \[
   \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, **the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1**.

**Final Response format:**
{odds: 4}
