To calculate the posterior odds given the observation of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we first use Bayes' theorem considering initial equal chances of selecting either deck.

1. Probability calculation:
   - **Deck A**: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O
     - X has a probability of 2/3 and O has a probability of 1/3 in Deck A.
     - The sequence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O can happen in multiple ways (combinatorially 4 since we could find O as card 1, 2, 3 or 4), so:
       \[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times (8/27) \times (1/3) = 32/81 \]
    
   - **Deck B**: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O
     - X has a probability of 1/3 and O has a probability of 2/3 in Deck B.
     - Similarly, drawing 3 X's and 1 O in Deck B is:
       \[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times (1/27) \times (2/3) = 8/81 \]

2. Ratios (Prior Odds & Posterior Odds):
   - **Prior odds** (P(A):P(B)): 1:1 since either deck could be chosen.
   - **Likelihood ratio**: (probability of evidence given Deck A) / (probability of evidence given Deck B)
     \[ \text{Likelihood Ratio} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 4 \]
   - **Posterior odds** (given equal prior odds):
     \[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \text{Prior Odds} \times \text{Likelihood Ratio} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds that the cards came from Deck A relative to Deck B are 4. This means it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
