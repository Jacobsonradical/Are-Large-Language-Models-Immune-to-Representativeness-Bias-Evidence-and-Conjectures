To solve this problem, we'll use Bayesian updating to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Initially, the prior odds of either deck being chosen are equal, since it was stated that one of the decks was selected "by chance." Therefore, the prior odds of choosing Deck A to Deck B is 1:1.

Next, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck:
1. **Probability from Deck A (Parsing where 2/3 cards are X and 1/3 are O)**:
  - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
    \[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. **Probability from Deck B (Parsing where 1/3 cards are X and 2/3 are O)**:
  - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
    \[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

To find the posterior odds, use the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \cdot \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Since the prior odds \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \) = 1 (assuming no preference for either deck initially),
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than from Deck B are 4:1, favoring Deck A.
  
Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
