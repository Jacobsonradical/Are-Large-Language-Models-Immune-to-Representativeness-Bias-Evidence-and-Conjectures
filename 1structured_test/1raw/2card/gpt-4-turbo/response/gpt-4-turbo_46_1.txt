First, we consider the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck:

1. **Deck A (more Xs):**
   - Probability of drawing an X: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O: 
     \[
     P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. **Deck B (more Os):**
   - Probability of drawing an X: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing an O: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O:
     \[
     P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

We have the ratio of probabilities (posterior odds) from Deck A to Deck B:
\[
\frac{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | Deck A})}{P(\text{3 Xs, 1 O | Deck B})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
