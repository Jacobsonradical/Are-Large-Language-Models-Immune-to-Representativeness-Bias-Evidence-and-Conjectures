To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given the observation of 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We will calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck and use these probabilities to update our beliefs (initially equally likely) about which deck the cards came from.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of choosing deck A and deck B, respectively. Since the question states one of the decks was chosen by chance, we can assume:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A, and \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B.

### Calculating \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) \)
In deck A, the probability of drawing an X is 2/3 and an O is 1/3. The number of ways to arrange 3 Xs and 1 O in four draws is given by combinations: \(\binom{4}{3}\) (choose 3 slots for X out of 4). Thus:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) \)
In deck B, the probability of drawing an X is 1/3 and an O is 2/3. Similarly:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Calculating posterior odds
The posterior odds for A relative to B given our observation (3X, 1O) are:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B \mid \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
