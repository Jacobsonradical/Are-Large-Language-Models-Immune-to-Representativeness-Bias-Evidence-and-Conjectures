To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we start by using Bayes' theorem, focusing on the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Deck A is chosen.
- \( B \) be the event that Deck B is chosen.
- \( D \) be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

The posterior odds are calculated as:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)}
\]
Since we have no information suggesting any bias toward selecting either deck, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)}
\]

Calculating \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):
1. **From Deck A (Probability that 3 cards drawn are X and 1 is O)**:
   \[
   P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times (8/27) \times (1/3) = 32/81 \approx 0.39506
   \]

2. **From Deck B (Probability that 3 cards drawn are X and 1 is O)**:
   \[
   P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times (1/27) \times (2/3) = 8/81 \approx 0.098765
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds are:
\[
\frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[
\{odds: 4\}
\]
