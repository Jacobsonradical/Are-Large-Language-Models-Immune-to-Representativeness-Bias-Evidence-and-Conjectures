To determine the posterior odds, we need to calculate the probability of drawing the given sequence from each deck and then use Bayes' rule to update our beliefs based on the evidence. 

1. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:**
   - Probability of drawing 1 X from Deck A = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing 1 O from Deck A = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - The distribution of drawing k success from n trials in a binomial setup is given by \( P(K = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \)
   - For Deck A:
     \[
     P(3\text{ Xs and 1 O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:**
   - Probability of drawing 1 X from Deck B = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing 1 O from Deck B = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - For Deck B:
     \[
     P(3\text{ Xs and 1 O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Calculate the posterior odds given equal prior odds for the decks:**
   - Let's assume prior odds are equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
   - Posterior odds for Deck A compared to Deck B given the observations:
     \[
     Odds(A|3X,1O) = \frac{P(3\text{ Xs and 1 O from A}) \cdot P(A)}{P(3\text{ Xs and 1 O from B}) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

{odds: 4}
