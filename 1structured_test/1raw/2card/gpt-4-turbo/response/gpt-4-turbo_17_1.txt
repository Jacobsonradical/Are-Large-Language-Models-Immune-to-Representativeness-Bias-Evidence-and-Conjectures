To determine the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we must use Bayes' Theorem. Using Bayes' formula, the posterior odds ratio can be computed as follows:

Given:
Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X (P(X|A)) = 2/3
- Probability of drawing O (P(O|A)) = 1/3

Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X (P(X|B)) = 1/3
- Probability of drawing O (P(O|B)) = 2/3

We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck:
- For Deck A: P(3X and 1O|A) = Combination(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81 * 1/3 = 32/243
- For Deck B: P(3X and 1O|B) = Combination(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 4/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Assuming the decks were equally likely to be chosen:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Using Bayes' rule for the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{\text{P(A|data)}}{\text{P(B|data)}} = \frac{\text{P(data|A) * P(A)}}{\text{P(data|B) * P(B)}} = \frac{32/243 * 1/2}{8/81 * 1/2} = \frac{32/243}{8/81} \]
\[ \text{Simplify the ratio} = \frac{32/243}{8/81} = \frac{32}{243} * \frac{81}{8} = 4 \times \frac{81}{243} \]
\[ \text{Simplify further} = 4 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4/3}
