To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, given that 3 of the cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we begin by calculating the likelihoods of drawing these cards from each deck.

### Probability of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X (P(X)) = 2/3
- Probability of drawing O (P(O)) = 1/3

Using the binomial probability formula: 
\[ P(3 \text{ Xs, 1 O} \,|\, \text{Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Probability of 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X (P(X)) = 1/3
- Probability of drawing O (P(O)) = 2/3

\[ P(3 \text{ Xs, 1 O} \,|\, \text{Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Prior probabilities:
Assuming equal priors for the decks (P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5), the posterior odds can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(3 \text{ Xs, 1 O} \,|\, \text{Deck A})}{P(3 \text{ Xs, 1 O} \,|\, \text{Deck B})} \times \frac{P(\text{Deck A})}{P(\text{Deck B})} \]

\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

### Answer:
Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B is 4.

{odds: 4}
