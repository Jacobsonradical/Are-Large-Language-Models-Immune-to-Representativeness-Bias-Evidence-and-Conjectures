To answer this question, we will use Bayes' theorem to update the odds based on the new information given (drawing 3 X's and 1 O).

We start by considering the prior odds of choosing either deck:
- The odds of choosing Deck A versus Deck B initially are 1:1, as it was chosen by chance.

Now, we need to consider the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
1. **Probability from Deck A** (`2/3 X`, `1/3 O`):
   - Probability drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws = (`2/3`)³ × (`1/3`) to choose 3 X's and 1 O
   - There are 4 ways to order 3 X's and 1 O (XXOX, XOXO, OXXX, XXXO), so total probability = 4 × (`2/3`)³ × (`1/3`)

2. **Probability from Deck B** (`1/3 X`, `2/3 O`):
   - Probability drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws = (`1/3`)³ × (`2/3`) to choose 3 X's and 1 O
   - Again, there are 4 ways to order these, so total probability = 4 × (`1/3`)³ × (`2/3`)

Calculating these:
- Probability from Deck A = 4 × (`2/3`)³ × (`1/3`) = 4 × `8/27` × `1/3` = `32/81`
- Probability from Deck B = 4 × (`1/3`)³ × (`2/3`) = 4 × `1/27` × `2/3` = `8/81`

Now we calculate odds:
- Likelihood ratio (LR) for choosing Deck A over Deck B based on evidence = Probability from Deck A / Probability from Deck B = `(32/81) / (8/81)` = 32 / 8 = 4.

Hence, the posterior odds for choosing Deck A over Deck B based on the evidence provided are:
- Given the initial odds were 1:1, updated odds are 4:1 (in favor of Deck A).

We can represent the answer in the requested format:
{odds: 4}
