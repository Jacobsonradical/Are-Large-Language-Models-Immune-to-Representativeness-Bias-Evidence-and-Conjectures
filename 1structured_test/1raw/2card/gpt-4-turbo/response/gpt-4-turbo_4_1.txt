We are tasked with finding the posterior odds that a sample of 4 cards drawn — 3 marked X and 1 marked O — comes from Deck A rather than Deck B.

Initially, let \( p_A \) and \( p_B \) be the probabilities we are drawing from Deck A and Deck B respectively. Assuming no preference, \( p_A = p_B = \frac{1}{2} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck is computed as follows:

For Deck A (where the probability of X is 2/3):
- \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}\)

For Deck B (where the probability of X is 1/3):
- \( P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}\)

The posterior odds \( \frac{P(A \mid \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B \mid \text{3X, 1O})} \) is proportional to the ratio of the product of the prior odds and the likelihoods:

\[
\frac{P(A \mid \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B \mid \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{p_A}{p_B} \cdot \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B)} = 1 \cdot \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
