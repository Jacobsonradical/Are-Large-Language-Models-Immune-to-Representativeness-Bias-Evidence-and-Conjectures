To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the probability of having chosen either Deck A or Deck B based on the observation of drawing 3 cards marked 'X', and 1 card marked 'O'.

Since either deck could be chosen, we start with equal priors:
- P(A) = 1/2 (Probability of choosing Deck A)
- P(B) = 1/2 (Probability of choosing Deck B)

We then calculate the likelihoods:
- In Deck A (2/3 X's, 1/3 O's):
  - P(3X and 1O | A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
  - Here, C(4, 3) represents the combination of choosing 3 X's out of 4 total draws, which equals 4.
  - So, P(3X and 1O | A) = 4 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81 * 1/3 = 32/243.

- In Deck B (1/3 X's, 2/3 O's):
  - P(3X and 1O | B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1
  - P(3X and 1O | B) = 4 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 4/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Next, apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:
- P(A | data) = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) / P(data)
- P(B | data) = P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B) / P(data)

Where P(data) = P(3X and 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X and 1O | B) * P(B)
- P(data) = (32/243 * 1/2) + (8/81 * 1/2) = 16/243 + 4/81 = 16/243 + 12/243 = 28/243

Thus,
- P(A | data) = (32/243) / (28/243) = 32 / 28 = 16/14 = 8/7
- P(B | data) = (8/81) / (28/243) = 8/81 * 243/28 = 24/28 = 6/7

Finally, the odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data is:
- Odds = P(A | data) / P(B | data) = (8/7) / (6/7) = 8/6 = 4/3

In final answer format:
{odds: 4/3}
