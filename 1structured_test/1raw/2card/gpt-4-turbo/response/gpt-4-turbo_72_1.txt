To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given the observed data "3 cards marked as X and 1 card marked as O," we'll deploy Bayesian reasoning.

First, compute the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:
- For Deck A: \(P(3X, 1O \,|\, \text{Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}\).
- For Deck B: \(P(3X, 1O \,|\, \text{Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}\).

The prior probability for each deck being chosen is 1/2 because it's stated that one of the decks is selected by chance, implying equal selection likelihood:
- \(P(\text{Deck A}) = \frac{1}{2}\),
- \(P(\text{Deck B}) = \frac{1}{2}\).

Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' Rule. The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihood of the data under each hypothesis times their respective prior probabilities:
- \( \text{Posterior odds for Deck A to Deck B} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \,|\, \text{Deck A}) \cdot P(\text{Deck A})}{P(3X, 1O \,|\, \text{Deck B}) \cdot P(\text{Deck B})} = \frac{\left(\frac{32}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{8}{81}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4\).

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (rather than Deck B) are:
{odds: 4}
