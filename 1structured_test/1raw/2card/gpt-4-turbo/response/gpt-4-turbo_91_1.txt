To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observations (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O), we use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) be the event that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( O \) be the observed event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

We need to find \( P(A|O) / P(B|O) \), the posterior odds.

We know:
- \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since the deck is chosen by chance, we assume equal probability).

The likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A is:
\[ P(O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B is:
\[ P(O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(O|A)}{P(O|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Since the prior odds \( P(A)/P(B) \) are \( \frac{1}{2} / \frac{1}{2} = 1 \), the posterior odds are the same as the likelihood ratio. Therefore, the posterior odds are 4.

Thus, the result is:
{odds: 4}
