To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B using Bayes' theorem. We start with the prior odds, then adjust with the likelihood ratio of the observed data under the hypotheses that the cards were from Deck A and Deck B.

**1. Define Probabilities and Likelihoods:**
- Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Assuming these are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- Let \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \) (probability of drawing card X or O from deck A).
- Let \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \) (probability of drawing card X or O from deck B).

**2. Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:**
- Likelihood in Deck A:
  \[
  P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]
- Likelihood in Deck B:
  \[
  P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

**3. Compute Odds and Update with Likelihood:**
- Likelihood ratio \( L \):
  \[
  L = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4
  \]
- Prior odds are \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = 1 \) since \( P(A) = P(B) \).
- Posterior odds \( O \) are given by \( O = \text{Prior odds} \times L = 1 \times 4 = 4 \).

Thus the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

**{odds: 4}**
