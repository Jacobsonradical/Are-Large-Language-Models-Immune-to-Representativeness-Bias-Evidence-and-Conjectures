To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we start by using Bayes' Theorem which connects the prior probabilities with the probabilities of the observed evidence (drawing 3 X's and 1 O).

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the probability that the cards are drawn from Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) be the probability that the cards are drawn from Deck B.
- \( P(3X, 1O \mid A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(3X, 1O \mid B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Assuming the prior probabilities of choosing either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Now, calculate \( P(3X, 1O \mid A) \) and \( P(3X, 1O \mid B) \) using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 4 \cdot 8/81 = 32/81 \]
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 4 \cdot 2/81 = 8/81 \]

The odds in favor of A given the evidence can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Odds for A vs B} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Odds for A vs B} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
