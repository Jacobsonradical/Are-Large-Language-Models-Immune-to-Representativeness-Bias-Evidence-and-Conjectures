To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we start by using Bayes' theorem as it relates to probability.

1. **Likelihood**: Compute the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.
   - **Deck A (2/3 X and 1/3 O)**: 
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
   - **Deck B (1/3 X and 2/3 O)**:
     \[
     P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

2. **Priors**: Assume equal probability of choosing either deck.
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

3. **Calculated the posterior odds** using the formula:
   \[
   \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data} | B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   - With equal priors, this simplifies to the likelihood ratio:
   \[
   \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4
   \]

**Conclusion**: The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B is 4.
