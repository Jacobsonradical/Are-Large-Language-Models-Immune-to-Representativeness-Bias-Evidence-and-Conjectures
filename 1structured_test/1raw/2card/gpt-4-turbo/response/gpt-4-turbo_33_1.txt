To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since one deck is chosen at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.

### Step 1: Calculating Likelihoods
The likelihoods can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(k \text{ successes in } n \text{ trials}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

#### For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X card, \( p_X = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card, \( p_O = \frac{1}{3} \)
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

#### For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X card, \( p_X = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O card, \( p_O = \frac{2}{3} \)
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Step 2: Calculating Posterior Odds
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A | X=3, O=1)}{P(B | X=3, O=1)} \]
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(X=3, O=1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(X=3, O=1 | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

### Final Answer
{odds: 4}
