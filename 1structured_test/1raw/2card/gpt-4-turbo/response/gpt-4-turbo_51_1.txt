To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given that 3 cards drawn are marked X and 1 card is marked O, we use Bayes' theorem. First, calculate the probabilities of getting 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing X = 2/3
- Probability of drawing O = 1/3
The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from deck A is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing X = 1/3
- Probability of drawing O = 2/3
The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O in any order from deck B is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

The prior probabilities of selecting either deck, \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\), are both 1/2 (since one deck is chosen at random).

The posterior odds \(O(A \mid \text{data})\) relative to \(O(B \mid \text{data})\) are calculated by:
\[ O(A \mid \text{data}) / O(B \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B) \times P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
