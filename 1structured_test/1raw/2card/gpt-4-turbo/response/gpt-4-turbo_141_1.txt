To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B given the drawing, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( A \): event that Deck A was chosen.
- \( B \): event that Deck B was chosen.
- \( D \): event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

First, calculate the likelihoods:
1. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (\( P(D|A) \)):
   \[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 32/81 \]

2. Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (\( P(D|B) \)):
   \[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 8/81 \]

Assuming we are equally likely to have started with either deck:
- \( P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, the posterior odds in favor of Deck A relative to Deck B are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} = \frac{32/81 \cdot 1/2}{8/81 \cdot 1/2} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
