To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use these probabilities to find the corresponding posterior odds. Here are the steps involved:

1. Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck A = 2/3.
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck A = 1/3.
   - The probability of any specific sequence of 3 X's and 1 O is:
     (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (1/3).
   - However, such a sequence can occur in multiple arrangements (since the O can be in any one of the 4 positions), and there are 4 choose 1 = 4 such possible sequences.
   - Therefore, the total probability (P_A) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
     \[ P_A = 4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3) = 4 \times (8/27) \times (1/3) = 32/81. \]

2. Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
   - Probability of drawing X from Deck B = 1/3.
   - Probability of drawing O from Deck B = 2/3.
   - The probability of any specific sequence of 3 Xâ€™s and 1 O is:
     (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3).
   - Again, we have 4 such possible sequences.
   - Therefore, the total probability (P_B) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
     \[ P_B = 4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3) = 4 \times (1/27) \times (2/3) = 8/81. \]

3. Calculate the odds based on these probabilities:
   - The odds are given as the ratio of P_A to P_B:
     \[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P_A}{P_B} = \frac{32/81}{8/81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
