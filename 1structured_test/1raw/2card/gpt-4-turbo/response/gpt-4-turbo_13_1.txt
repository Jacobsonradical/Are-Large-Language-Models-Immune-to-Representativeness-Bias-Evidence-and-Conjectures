To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O, we start by calculating the likelihood of drawing these cards from Deck A and Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( P(X|A) \) as the probability of drawing an X card from Deck A
- \( P(O|A) \) as the probability of drawing an O card from Deck A
- \( P(X|B) \) as the probability of drawing an X card from Deck B
- \( P(O|B) \) as the probability of drawing an O card from Deck B

Given:
- Deck A: \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3}, P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Deck B: \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3}, P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Now, considering the drawing of 3 Xs and 1 O, the likelihood of drawing these cards from Deck A, denoted as \( P(3X,1O|A) \), can be calculated using the binomial formula:
\[ P(3X,1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} (P(X|A))^3 (P(O|A)) = 4 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Similarly, the likelihood of drawing these cards from Deck B, denoted as \( P(3X,1O|B) \):
\[ P(3X,1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} (P(X|B))^3 (P(O|B)) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

To find posterior odds, which is \( \frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)} \), we utilize the Bayes formula where initial (prior) odds is assumed equal since one deck was randomly chosen:
\[ \frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)} = \frac{P(3X,1O|A)}{P(3X,1O|B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Given \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), this simplifies further:
\[ \frac{P(A|3X,1O)}{P(B|3X,1O)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
