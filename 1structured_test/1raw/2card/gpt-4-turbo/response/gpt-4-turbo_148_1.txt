To answer the question, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O from each deck and then determine the posterior odds favoring deck A over deck B.

**Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (PAX) and from Deck B (PBX).**

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 1/3
- Using the binomial formula:
  - \( P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) 
    = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \).

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an O = 2/3
- Using the binomial formula:
  - \( P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) 
    = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \).

**Step 2: Calculate the prior odds, which in this case are equal, as each deck had an equal chance of being selected:**
- \( \text{Odds(A)} = 1 \)
- \( \text{Odds(B)} = 1 \)
- Thus, the prior odds ratio for A to B is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \).

**Step 3: Update for the likelihood ratio (Bayes' update):**
- The likelihood ratio (LR) for A compared to B when drawing 3 X’s and 1 O is:
  - \( LR = \frac{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from A})}{P(\text{3 X's, 1 O from B})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \).

**Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds.**
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
  - \(\text{Posterior Odds(A to B)} = 1 \times 4 = 4\).

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
