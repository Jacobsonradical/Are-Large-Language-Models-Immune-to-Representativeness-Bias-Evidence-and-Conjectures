To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, based on the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 marked O), we'll use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the probability of having chosen each deck after observing the outcome of the draws.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since one of the decks is chosen by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).
- \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- \( P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.

Using the binomial probability formula:
- For Deck A, where the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \),
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}. \]

- For Deck B, where the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \),
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}. \]

The odds in favor of Deck A to Deck B given the data are calculated by:
\[ \text{Odds}(A | \text{data}) = \frac{P(X = 3, O = 1 | A)}{P(X = 3, O = 1 | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
