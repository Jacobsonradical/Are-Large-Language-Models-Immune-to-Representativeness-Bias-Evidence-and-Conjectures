To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to apply Bayesian updating. We'll start by computing the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is selected by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

We denote:
- \( E \) as the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

The likelihoods are calculated as:
1. **From Deck A (Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O)**
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - The probability of drawing exactly 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A: \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \).
  
2. **From Deck B (Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O)**
   - Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - The probability of drawing exactly 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B: \( \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \).

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**
The posterior odds for Deck A to Deck B given E can be calculated using Bayes' theorem for odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds for A to B} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{1}{1} = \frac{32}{8} = 4. \]

Therefore, the posterior odds favoring Deck A over Deck B given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn is:
{odds: 4}
