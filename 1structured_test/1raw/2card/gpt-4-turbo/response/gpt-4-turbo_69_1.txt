To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck. Then we update our beliefs (priors) based on these likelihoods.

**Calculation of likelihoods:**

- **Deck A:**
  - Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
  - Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Likelihood for drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O:
    \[
    {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
    \]

- **Deck B:**
  - Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
  - Likelihood for drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O:
    \[
    {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
    \]

**Prior probabilities:**
  - Assuming equal initial probabilities for selecting either deck:
    \[
    P(\text{Deck A}) = P(\text{Deck B}) = 0.5
    \]

**Posterior probabilities calculation using Bayes' Theorem:**
  - Total likelihood = \(P(D = A) \times L(\text{Deck A}) + P(D = B) \times L(\text{Deck B})\)
  - \(0.5 \times \frac{32}{81} + 0.5 \times \frac{8}{81} = 0.5 \times \frac{40}{81} = \frac{20}{81}\)

- Posterior for Deck A:
  \[
  P(\text{Deck A} \mid \text{data}) = \frac{0.5 \times \frac{32}{81}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{16}{20} = 0.8
  \]

- Posterior for Deck B:
  \[
  P(\text{Deck B} \mid \text{data}) = \frac{0.5 \times \frac{8}{81}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{4}{20} = 0.2
  \]

**Posterior Odds:**
  - \[
    \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4
    \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to being drawn from Deck B, given the observed cards, is 4.
