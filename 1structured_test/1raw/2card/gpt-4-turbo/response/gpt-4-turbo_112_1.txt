To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' rule and calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck, and then multiply by the prior odds.

Let's define the events:
A = Drawing from Deck A.
B = Drawing from Deck B.

As stated, the prior probability of selecting either deck is equal:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A (P(Data|A)):
P(XXXO|A) = C(4, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81.

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B (P(Data|B)):
P(XXXO|B) = C(4, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81.

Now, calculate the posterior odds which is given by 
(Odds for A)/(Odds for B) = [P(Data|A) * P(A)] / [P(Data|B) * P(B)] = (P(Data|A) / P(Data|B)) * (P(A) / P(B)).

Since P(A) = P(B), the ratio P(A)/P(B) = 1. So, we simply need:
Odds(A to B) = P(Data|A) / P(Data|B) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4.

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A is:
{odds: 4}
