To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards came from Deck A vs. Deck B, we will apply Bayes' Rule. Let's break this down into easy steps:

Denote \( A \) and \( B \) as the event of selecting Deck A or Deck B respectively. Let \( E \) be the event of observing 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to find:
\[ \text{Posterior odds of } A \text{ to } B = \frac{P(A \mid E)}{P(B \mid E)} \]

Using Bayes' Rule, this can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid E)}{P(B \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid A) P(A)}{P(E \mid B) P(B)} \]

Assuming the decks are equally likely to be chosen initially:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Thus, the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(E \mid A)}{P(E \mid B)} \]

**Calculate \( P(E \mid A) \) and \( P(E \mid B) \):**

1. \( P(E \mid A) \) - the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(E \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

2. \( P(E \mid B) \) - the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(E \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Calculate the ratio:**
\[ \frac{P(E \mid A)}{P(E \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
