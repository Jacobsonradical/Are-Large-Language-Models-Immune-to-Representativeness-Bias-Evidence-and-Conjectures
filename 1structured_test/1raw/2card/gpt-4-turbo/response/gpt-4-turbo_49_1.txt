To solve this problem, we will calculate the probability of observing the given outcome (3 X's and 1 O) from both Deck A and Deck B, and then use Bayes' theorem to find the ratio of these probabilities, also known as the posterior odds.

**Deck A**:
- Probability of drawing an 'X' = 2/3
- Probability of drawing an 'O' = 1/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (using binomial probability formula):
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{243} \]

**Deck B**:
- Probability of drawing an 'X' = 1/3
- Probability of drawing an 'O' = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1 \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, since Decks A and B are equally likely to be chosen:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{data})} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B)}{P(\text{data})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{data}) = P(\text{data} \mid A) P(A) + P(\text{data} \mid B) P(B) = \frac{32}{243} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{32}{486} + \frac{12}{243} = \frac{44}{486} = \frac{22}{243} \]

Now, the odds ratio in favor of Deck A being chosen relative to Deck B:
\[ \frac{P(A \mid \text{data})}{P(B \mid \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} \mid A)}{P(\text{data} \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{243}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32/243}{8/81} = \frac{32}{243} \cdot \frac{81}{8} = \frac{32 \cdot 81}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{2592}{1944} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4/3}
