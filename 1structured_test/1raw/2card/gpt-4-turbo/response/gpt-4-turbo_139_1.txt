To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we first need the likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck and then apply Bayes' theorem.

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
- The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is given by the combination formula (binomial distribution):
  \[
  P(3X,1O|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
- The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O is similarly:
  \[
  P(3X,1O|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

The prior probabilities \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\) are equal, as one of the decks is chosen by chance:
- \(P(A) = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(P(B) = \frac{1}{2}\)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are given by the ratio of the products of the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:
\[
\text{Odds}(A|B) = \frac{P(3X,1O|A)P(A)}{P(3X,1O|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
