To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck given their compositions, and then use Bayes' theorem to compute the odds of this outcome having come from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let \( P(D = A) \) be the probability of having chosen Deck A initially, and \( P(D = B) \) be the probability of having chosen Deck B. These are equally likely, so \( P(D = A) = P(D = B) = 0.5 \).

Let \( P(X = 3, O = 1|D) \) represent the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given a deck D.

For Deck A:
- Probability of X = 2/3
- Probability of O = 1/3

Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of X = 1/3
- Probability of O = 2/3

Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(X = 3, O = 1|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ \frac{P(D = A|X = 3,O = 1)}{P(D = B|X = 3, O = 1)} = \frac{P(X = 3, O = 1|A)P(D = A)}{P(X = 3, O = 1|B)P(D = B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
