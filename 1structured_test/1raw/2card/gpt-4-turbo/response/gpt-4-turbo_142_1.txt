To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood:

**Step 1: Calculate the prior odds.**
Since one of the decks is chosen by chance, the prior probability \(P(A)\) for Deck A and \(P(B)\) for Deck B are both \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.**
- From Deck A, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) Xs and \( \frac{1}{3} \) Os, the likelihood \( P(data|A) \) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial formula:
  \[
  P(data|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

- From Deck B, which has \( \frac{1}{3} \) Xs and \( \frac{2}{3} \) Os, the likelihood \( P(data|B) \) of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
  \[
  P(data|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.**
Using Bayes' theorem, we need to compare the ratios of the likelihood of the data given each hypothesis, which are proportional to the posterior probabilities:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(data|A)}{P(data|B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{1}{1} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

**Conclusion:**
The posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A, given the observed data, compared to Deck B, are 4.
