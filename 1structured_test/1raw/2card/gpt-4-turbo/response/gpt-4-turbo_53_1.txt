To determine the posterior odds, we first need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck separately, and then use Bayes' theorem to update the probabilities based on the evidence provided.

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event that Deck A was chosen.
- \( B \) represent the event that Deck B was chosen.
- \( E \) represent the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O.

We assume that each deck has an equal likelihood of being chosen initially, so:
\[ \Pr(A) = \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck A:
\[ \Pr(E \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from Deck B:
\[ \Pr(E \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that we picked Deck A given the evidence (E) is:
\[ \Pr(A \mid E) = \frac{\Pr(E \mid A) \Pr(A)}{\Pr(E \mid A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(E \mid B) \Pr(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{32}{162}}{\frac{32}{162} + \frac{8}{162}} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]

The posterior probability that we picked Deck B given E is:
\[ \Pr(B \mid E) = 0.2 \]

To find the odds, calculate \(\frac{\Pr(A \mid E)}{\Pr(B \mid E)}\):
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\{odds: 4\}
