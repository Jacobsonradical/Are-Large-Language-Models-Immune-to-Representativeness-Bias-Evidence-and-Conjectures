To find the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since one deck was chosen at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \) (probabilities of drawing X and O from Deck A, respectively).
- \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \) (probabilities of drawing X and O from Deck B, respectively).

### Step 1: Calculate the likelihoods

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial formula:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[= 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Similarly, for Deck B:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[= 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Step 2: Use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to calculate posterior odds

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the observed cards is:
\[ \frac{P(A | 3X, 1O)}{P(B | 3X, 1O)} = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A) P(A)}{P(3X, 1O | B) P(B)} \times \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Given \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the fraction of prior probabilities \( \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \) simplifies to 1, leaving:
\[ \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Hence, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 4}
