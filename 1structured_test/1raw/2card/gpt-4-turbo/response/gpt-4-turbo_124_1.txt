To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A rather than Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem and the concept of likelihood ratios.

1. **Deck A (mostly Xs) Distribution**: 
   - Probability of drawing X: 2/3
   - Probability of drawing O: 1/3

2. **Deck B (mostly Os) Distribution**: 
   - Probability of drawing X: 1/3
   - Probability of drawing O: 2/3

3. **Observed Outcome**: 
   - Draw 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

4. **Calculate Likelihoods**:
   - Likelihood of drawing 3X, 1O from Deck A: `(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1` = `(8/27) * (1/3)` = `8/81`
   - Likelihood of drawing 3X, 1O from Deck B: `(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1` = `(1/27) * (2/3)` = `2/81`

5. **Calculate the Likelihood Ratio** (Probability of observing the data given Deck A over probability given Deck B):
   - Likelihood Ratio = `(8/81) / (2/81)` = `8 / 2 = 4`

6. **Initial Odds** (Prior Odds):
   - Since it's equally likely that either deck could be chosen: 1 (i.e., 1:1).

7. **Posterior Odds** using Bayes' Rule (Posterior odds = Likelihood Ratio Ã— Prior Odds):
   - Posterior Odds = `4 * 1` = `4`

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1. This means it is four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B based on the observed data.

Therefore, the response format should be:
{odds: 4}
