To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B after observing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, we need to employ Bayesian probability.

Let \( A \) and \( B \) denote the events where the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Let \( D \) represent the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**Step 1: Calculate the prior probabilities.**
Because one of the decks is chosen at random:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing \( D \) given \( A \) and \( B \).**
For Deck A:
\[ P(D \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(D \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81 \]

**Step 3: Use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities.**
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Where 
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid A)P(A) + P(D \mid B)P(B) = 32/81 \times 0.5 + 8/81 \times 0.5 = 40/81 \times 0.5 = 20/81 \]

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{32/81 × 0.5}{20/81} = \frac{32/81}{20/81} = \frac{32}{20} = 1.6 \]

\[ P(B \mid D) = \frac{8/81 × 0.5}{20/81} = \frac{8/81}{20/81} = \frac{8}{20} = 0.4 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds of \( A \) relative to \( B \).**
\[ \frac{P(A \mid D)}{P(B \mid D)} = \frac{1.6}{0.4} = 4 \]

Finally, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4. Expressing this in the requested format:
