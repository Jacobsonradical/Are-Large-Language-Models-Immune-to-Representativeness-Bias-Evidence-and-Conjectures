To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds ratio that deck A was chosen given the observed card draw (3 X's and 1 O), in comparison to deck B. We utilize Bayes' theorem for this, which in terms of odds ratio can be formulated as:

\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio}
\]

Here, the prior odds for decks A and B are 1:1 since one deck is chosen randomly (equal probability).

### Step 1: Calculate the Likelihood for Each Deck
1. **Likelihood from Deck A (most cards marked X):**
   - Probability to draw 3 X's = \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3\)
   - Probability to draw 1 O = \(\frac{1}{3}\)
   - Since the draws are without replacement, and the deck is very large (assuming independence):
     \[
     L(A) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

2. **Likelihood from Deck B (most cards marked O):**
   - Probability to draw 3 X's = \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\)
   - Probability to draw 1 O = \frac{2}{3}
   - Assuming independence:
     \[
     L(B) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{81}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Likelihood Ratio
The likelihood ratio comparing the likelihood of drawing 4 cards from Deck A to Deck B is:
\[
\text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{L(A)}{L(B)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81}}{\frac{2}{81}} = 4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Posterior Odds
Given that the prior odds are 1 (equal probability for deck A or B), the posterior odds are:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio} = 1 \times 4 = 4
\]

This means the odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the one with more X's, compared to Deck B, is 4:1.
