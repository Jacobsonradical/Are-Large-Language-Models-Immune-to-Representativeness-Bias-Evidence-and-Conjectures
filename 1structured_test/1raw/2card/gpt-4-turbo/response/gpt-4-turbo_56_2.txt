To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we start by calculating the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck (Deck A and Deck B). We can then use Bayes' theorem to update the prior odds based on the likelihood of this evidence.

### Prior Probability:
Let's assume the prior probability of choosing any deck is equal:
- \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\)

### Likelihood Calculation:

#### For Deck A:
Deck A has 2/3 of the cards marked X and 1/3 marked O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 cards is given by:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

#### For Deck B:
Deck B has 1/3 of the cards marked X and 2/3 marked O. The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]
\[ = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds:
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds ratio favoring Deck A to Deck B based on observing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ \text{Odds}(A : B | \text{data}) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
