To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' Theorem and consider the prior odds and the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

1. **Prior odds**: 
   Since one of the decks is randomly selected, the prior odds for Deck A vs. Deck B is 1:1 (or simply 1).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - From **Deck A** (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
     The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is calculated using the combination formula:
     \[
     P(\text{3X, 1O | A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]
     
   - From **Deck B** (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
     The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
     \[
     P(\text{3X, 1O | B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

3. **Posterior Odds**:
   Using Bayes' rule reformulated as odds:
   \[
   \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \cdot \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O | A})}{P(\text{3X, 1O | B})}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \text{Posterior odds} = 1 \cdot \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
