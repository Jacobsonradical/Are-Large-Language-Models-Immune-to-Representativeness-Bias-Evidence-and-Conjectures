To solve this problem, we will utilize Bayes' Theorem and probability calculations. Initially, the probability of selecting either deck (A or B) is equal, hence \(P(A) = P(B) = 0.5\).

Next, we analyze the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O from each deck.

**Deck A Calculations**:
Deck A has \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards marked X and \( \frac{1}{3} \) marked O. The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O out of 4 cards can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

**Deck B Calculations**:
Deck B has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the cards marked X and \( \frac{2}{3} \) marked O. The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O out of 4 cards from this deck is:
\[ P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Posterior Odds Calculation**:
Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Odds}(A | \text{data}) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)}{P(3X, 1O | B)} \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Odds}(A | \text{data}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \times \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the deck chosen is A rather than B, given the observation of 3 X cards and 1 O card, is 4 to 1.

Hence, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
