To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck.

Let \( p(E|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ p(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Let \( p(E|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ p(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Given that the prior odds are equal (as it's stated the deck was chosen by chance and no deck was favored over another), the prior odds ratio is 1:1.

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds. The posterior odds ratio is calculated by multiplying the prior odds ratio by the likelihood ratio (the ratio of \( p(E|A) \) to \( p(E|B) \)):
\[ \text{Posterior odds ratio} = \text{Prior odds ratio} \times \frac{p(E|A)}{p(E|B)} \]

Substituting the calculated probabilities:
\[ \text{Posterior odds ratio} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{81} \div \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus:
{odds: 4}
