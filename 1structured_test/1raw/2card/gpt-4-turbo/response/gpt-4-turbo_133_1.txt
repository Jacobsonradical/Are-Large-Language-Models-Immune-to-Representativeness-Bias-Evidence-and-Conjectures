To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given the observed draws (3 Xs and 1 O), we'll use Bayesian updating.

1. **Calculate the probabilities of the observation for each deck:**

   For Deck A (2/3 cards are X, 1/3 are O):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
   \]

   For Deck B (1/3 cards are X, 2/3 are O):
   \[
   P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
   \]

2. **Initial odds (prior odds):**
   
   Since it's equally likely to choose either deck, the prior odds ratio is 1:1.

3. **Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' Rule:**
   \[
   \text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = 1 \times \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, versus Deck B are 4:1.
