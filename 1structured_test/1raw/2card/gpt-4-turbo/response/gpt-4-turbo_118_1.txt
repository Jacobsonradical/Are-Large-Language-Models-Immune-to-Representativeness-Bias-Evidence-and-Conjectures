To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.**
   
   - **Probability from Deck A (pA|data):**  
     Since Deck A has 2/3 of the cards marked X and 1/3 marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial formula:
     \[
     {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

   - **Probability from Deck B (pB|data):**  
     Since Deck B has 1/3 of the cards marked X and 2/3 marked O, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
     \[
     {4 \choose 3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

2. **Compute the ratio of these probabilities (likelihood ratio).**
   \[
   \text{Likelihood Ratio} = \frac{pA|data}{pB|data} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4
   \]

3. **Include prior probabilities if required (prior odds).**  
   Assuming equal prior probabilities of choosing either deck (1:1 or equal likelihood of choosing A or B):
   \[
   \text{Prior Odds} = \frac{\text{Probability of choosing A}}{\text{Probability of choosing B}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
   \]

4. **Calculate the posterior odds.**
   \[
   \text{Posterior Odds} = \text{Likelihood Ratio} \times \text{Prior Odds} = 4 \times 1 = 4
   \]

Therefore:

{odds: 4}
