To solve this problem, we are interested in the posterior odds that deck A was chosen given the observed data (drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O). We start by calculating the likelihoods of observing this sequence from each deck and then use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

First, let's denote:
\( P(D = A) \) as the probability that deck A was selected,
\( P(D = B) \) as the probability that deck B was selected,
\( P(E | D = A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A,
\( P(E | D = B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B.

Since each deck is equally probable to be chosen, we have:
\[ P(D = A) = P(D = B) = 0.5 \]

Now, we compute \( P(E | D = A) \) and \( P(E | D = B) \):
Given deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

Using the binomial coefficient formula, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(E | D = A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Given deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in this case is:
\[ P(E | D = B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{P(E | D = A)}{P(E | D = B)} \]
\[ \text{Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
