To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A (where most cards are marked X) rather than from deck B (where most cards are marked O), we will use Bayesian reasoning.

Let \( A \) be the event that deck A was chosen, and \( B \) be the event that deck B was chosen.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that deck A is chosen is 1/2, and similarly \( P(B) = 1/2 \).

Next, calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck:
- For deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X): 
  \[
  P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]
- For deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X):
  \[
  P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:
- \( P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O}) \) and \( P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O}) \):
  \[
  P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = \frac{P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | A) P(A)}{P(\text{3 X and 1 O})}
  \]
  \[
  P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = \frac{P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | B) P(B)}{P(\text{3 X and 1 O})}
  \]
Where \( P(\text{3 X and 1 O}) \) is the overall probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, calculated as:
  \[
  P(\text{3 X and 1 O}) = P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | A) P(A) + P(\text{3 X and 1 O} | B) P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{20}{81}
  \]

Thus:
- \( P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{16}{20} = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O}) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{4}{20} = 0.2 \)

Calculating the posterior odds:
  \[
  \frac{P(A | \text{3 X and 1 O})}{P(B | \text{3 X and 1 O})} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4
  \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
{odds: 4}
