To solve this problem, we first calculate the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck (Deck A and Deck B), and then use these probabilities to compute the posterior odds favoring Deck A over Deck B.

1. **Probability Calculation:**
   - **Deck A**: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.
     - Probability of X in Deck A: 2/3
     - Probability of O in Deck A: 1/3
     - The number of ways to choose 3 Xs and 1 O out of 4 total draws (combination factor): \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
     - Probability: \(4 \times (2/3)^3 \times (1/3)^1 = 4 \times 8/27 \times 1/3 = 32/81 \times 1/3 = 32/243\)

   - **Deck B**: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.
     - Probability of X in Deck B: 1/3
     - Probability of O in Deck B: 2/3
     - Combination factor: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
     - Probability: \(4 \times (1/3)^3 \times (2/3)^1 = 4 \times 1/27 \times 2/3 = 4/27 \times 2/3 = 8/81\)

2. **Calculation of Posterior Odds:**
   We use Bayes' theorem, considering that initially, the probability of choosing Deck A = Deck B = 1/2 (prior probabilities are equal).
   - Prior Odds for Deck A to Deck B = 1:1
   - The likelihood ratio (Posterior Odds) is calculated as: 
     \[
     \frac{P(3\text{ Xs and }1\text{ O }|\text{ Deck A})}{P(3\text{ Xs and }1\text{ O }|\text{ Deck B})} = \frac{32/243}{8/81} = \frac{32/243}{8/81} \times \frac{81}{1} = \frac{32 \times 81}{243 \times 8} = \frac{2592}{1944} = \frac{4}{3}
     \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A rather than deck B is 4/3.
