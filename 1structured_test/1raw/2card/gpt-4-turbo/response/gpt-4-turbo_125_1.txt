To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about whether the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A or Deck B based on the evidence provided by the drawn cards. We start by calculating the probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 marked O from each deck, then use these probabilities to find the posterior odds.

**Step 1: Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from each deck**

For Deck A (2/3 marked X and 1/3 marked O):
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 marked X and 2/3 marked O):
\[ P(3X, 1O \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 2: Calculate posterior odds**

The prior odds for selecting either deck are even (since one of the decks is selected by chance), so prior odds are 1:1. 

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio (the ratio of probabilities calculated in Step 1):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(3X, 1O \mid A)}{P(3X, 1O \mid B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1, favoring Deck A.
