To begin solving this problem, we calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck, and then use Bayes' theorem to compare the probabilities of having selected either Deck A or Deck B.

**Step 1: Calculate likelihoods**

- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[
P(3X, 1O | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}
\]

- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[
P(3X, 1O | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
\]

**Step 2: Prior probability**

Since there is no information favoring the selection of one deck over the other, let the prior probabilities be:
\[
P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' Rule**

We need to calculate \(P(A | \text{data})\) and \(P(B | \text{data})\), where 'data' denotes the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O. Using Bayes' rule:

- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O overall:
\[
P(\text{data}) = P(3X, 1O | A) P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81}
\]

- Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | \text{data}) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | A)P(A)}{P(\text{data})} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

\[
P(B | \text{data}) = \frac{P(3X, 1O | B)P(B)}{P(\text{data})} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate posterior odds**
\[
\text{Odds for A relative to B} = \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4
\]

Thus, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
