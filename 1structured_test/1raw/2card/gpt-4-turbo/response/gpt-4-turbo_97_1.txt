To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities and then find the odds ratio of drawing cards from Deck A as opposed to Deck B given the observed data.

Let:

- \( A \) be the event that Deck A is chosen.
- \( B \) be the event that Deck B is chosen.
- \( E \) be the evidence, or observed event, that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to calculate \( P(A|E) \) and \( P(B|E) \) and then find the ratio \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).


1. **Prior Probabilities**: Since one of the decks is chosen by chance, 
   \[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}. \]

2. **Likelihoods**:  
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (where \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)):
     \[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}. \]
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (where \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)):
     \[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}. \]

3. **Bayes' Rule**:
   \[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) P(A)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E)} \]
   Where \( P(E) = P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81}. \]

   So:
   \[ P(A|E) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}. \]
   \[ P(B|E) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}. \]

4. **Odds**:
   \[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4. \]

Answer:
{odds: 4}
