To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds for having chosen Deck A over Deck B, given the observation of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. We start by determining the likelihood of this observation under each deck configuration and use this to update our beliefs about the decks using Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \( P(D_A) \) and \( P(D_B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Given no preference information, we assume \( P(D_A) = P(D_B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(X|D_A) = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( P(O|D_A) = \frac{1}{3} \) for Deck A.
- \( P(X|D_B) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P(O|D_B) = \frac{2}{3} \) for Deck B.

The observation is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O. The probability of this observation for each deck is:
- For Deck A: \( P(3X, 1O | D_A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \)
- For Deck B: \( P(3X, 1O | D_B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds for Deck A over Deck B given the data is:
\[ \frac{P(D_A | \text{data})}{P(D_B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | D_A) \times P(D_A)}{P(\text{data} | D_B) \times P(D_B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

This calculation implies the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A relative to Deck B are 4. Thus, it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B given the observations.
