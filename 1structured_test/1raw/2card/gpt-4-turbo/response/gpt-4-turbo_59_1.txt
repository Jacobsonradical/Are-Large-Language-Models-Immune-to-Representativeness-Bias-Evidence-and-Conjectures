To solve this question, we will perform Bayesian analysis using the given data and calculate the probability (likelihood) of drawing three X cards and one O card from each deck, followed by using Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the decks.

**Step 1: Calculating Prior Probabilities**

Let \( P(A) \) be the probability that Deck A was chosen, and \( P(B) \) the probability that Deck B was chosen. Since the deck is chosen by chance,
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

**Step 2: Calculating Likelihoods**

Having selected a deck, the likelihood of drawing cards in the sequence of three X's and one O from each deck can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Deck A
- Probability of drawing X, \( p(X) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O, \( p(O) = \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (order does not matter) is given by:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B
- Probability of drawing X, \( p(X) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing O, \( p(O) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

**Step 3: Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' theorem lets us update our prior probability based on new evidence:
\[ P(A \mid \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O})} \]

Using the Law of Total Probability for \( P(\text{3X, 1O}) \):
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O}) = P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid A) P(A) + P(\text{3X, 1O} \mid B) P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \times 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \times 0.5 = \frac{40}{81} \times 0.5 = \frac{20}{81} \]

Therefore,
\[ P(A \mid \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \]

**Step 4: Calculating Posterior Odds Ratio**

The posterior odds ratio of Deck A to Deck B, given the observation of 3X and 1O, is:
\[ \text{Odds}(A:B \mid 3X, 1O) = \frac{P(A \mid 3X, 1O)}{P(B \mid 3X, 1O)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
