To find the posterior odds that the four cards were drawn from Deck A versus Deck B, given that three cards drawn were marked X and one was marked O, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

1. **Set up probabilities**:
   - Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since the deck was chosen at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
   - Let \( P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - Let \( P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

2. **Calculating individual probabilities**:
   - For Deck A: \( P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, A) = \binom{4}{3} (2/3)^3 (1/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (8/27) \cdot (1/3) = 32/81 \).
   - For Deck B: \( P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, B) = \binom{4}{3} (1/3)^3 (2/3)^1 = 4 \cdot (1/27) \cdot (2/3) = 8/81 \).

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We need the posterior probabilities:
     - \( P(A \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \propto P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, A) \cdot P(A) \)
     - \( P(B \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \propto P(X = 3, O = 1 \,|\, B) \cdot P(B) \)
   - Using values \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the calculation is straightforward:
     - \( P(A \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \propto 0.5 \cdot 32/81 \)
     - \( P(B \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \propto 0.5 \cdot 8/81 \)

4. **Calculating Odds**:
   Given \( P(A \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \) and \( P(B \,|\, X = 3, O = 1) \) are proportional to \( 32/81 \) and \( 8/81 \), respectively, and both multiplied by the prior 0.5 which cancels out, the odds favoring A over B simplify to:
   - \( \frac{32/81}{8/81} = 32/8 = 4 \)

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
