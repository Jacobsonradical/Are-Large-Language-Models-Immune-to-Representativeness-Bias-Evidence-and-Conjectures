To solve this, let's calculate the posterior odds for Deck A versus Deck B based on the observation of drawing 3 X's and 1 O. The idea is to use Bayes' Rule to update our beliefs about the probability of choosing each deck given the results of the draws.

**Definitions:**
- Let \( A \) represent selecting from Deck A, and \( B \) represent selecting from Deck B.
- Since one deck is selected at random, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

**Calculating Likelihood for Each Deck:**
- **Deck A:** Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is calculated using the binomial formula as:
  \[
  P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck A}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right).
  \]
  Simplifying,
  \[
  P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck A}) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}.
  \]

- **Deck B:** Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
  \[
  P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck B}) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right).
  \]
  Simplifying,
  \[
  P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck B}) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}.
  \]

**Calculate Posterior Odds:**
Now we calculate the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A as opposed to Deck B:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck A}) \times P(A)}{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O | Deck B}) \times P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4.
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 drawn cards came from Deck A (relative to them coming from Deck B) are:
```
{odds: 4}
