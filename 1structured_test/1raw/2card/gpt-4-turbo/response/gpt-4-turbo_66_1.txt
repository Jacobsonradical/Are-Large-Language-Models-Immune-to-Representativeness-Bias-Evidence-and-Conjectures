To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian probability to calculate the posterior odds of drawing the cards from either deck A or deck B. The solution involves:

1. **Calculating the likelihood** of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from each deck.
2. **Calculating the posterior probability** for each deck based on these likelihoods, considering the prior probability for each deck (which is equal, as the question states the deck was selected by chance).

### Step 1: Calculate Likelihoods
Let's denote \( P(X=3, O=1 | A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
\[ P(X=3, O=1 | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81}.\]

Now for deck B, \( P(X=3, O=1 | B) \):
\[ P(X=3, O=1 | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81}.\]

### Step 2: Calculate Posterior Probabilities
We assume that initially, each deck has an equal probability of being selected, so \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \). The posterior odds \( \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} \) can be computed using Bayes' Theorem.

Using Bayes:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(X=3, O=1 | A)P(A)}{P(X=3, O=1 | B)P(B)} = \frac{P(X=3, O=1 | A)}{P(X=3, O=1 | B)} \cdot \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}.\]

Substituting values:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \cdot \frac{1}{1} = \frac{32}{8} = 4.\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.

### Conclusion
This means it’s 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B, provided this data of drawing 3 X’s and 1 O.

**Final Answer:**
{odds: 4}
