To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find the odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck)
- P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Substituting:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5)
                = (8/27) / (2/27)
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 4}
