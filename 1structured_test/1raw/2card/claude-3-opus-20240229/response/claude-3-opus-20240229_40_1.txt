To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The posterior odds are P(A|X) / P(B|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equally likely to select either deck)

Posterior odds = 0.0987 * 0.5 / (0.0329 * 0.5) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 3}
