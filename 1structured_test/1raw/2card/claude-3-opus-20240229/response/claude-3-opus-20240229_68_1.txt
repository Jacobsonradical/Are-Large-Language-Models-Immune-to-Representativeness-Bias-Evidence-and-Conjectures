To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B))
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / (P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4.

Now, let's substitute these values:

P(A|D) = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0987 * 0.5 + 0.0329 * 0.5) = 0.75
P(B|D) = (0.0329 * 0.5) / (0.0987 * 0.5 + 0.0329 * 0.5) = 0.25

The posterior odds is the ratio of these probabilities:

Posterior Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 0.75 / 0.25 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 3 to 1.
