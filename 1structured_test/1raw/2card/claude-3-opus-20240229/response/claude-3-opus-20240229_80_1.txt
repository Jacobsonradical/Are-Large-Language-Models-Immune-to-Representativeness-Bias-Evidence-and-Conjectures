To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to calculate the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we are calculating the odds, the P(D) term will cancel out.

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (the deck is selected by chance)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5)
                = 0.1975 / 0.0247
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8 to 1.
