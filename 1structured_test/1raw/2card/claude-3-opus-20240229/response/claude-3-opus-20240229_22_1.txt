To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

The posterior odds are given by:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, the posterior odds simplify to:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Now, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability formula:

P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ≈ 0.1975
P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 ≈ 0.0494

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 0.1975 / 0.0494 ≈ 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 4 to 1.
