To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
