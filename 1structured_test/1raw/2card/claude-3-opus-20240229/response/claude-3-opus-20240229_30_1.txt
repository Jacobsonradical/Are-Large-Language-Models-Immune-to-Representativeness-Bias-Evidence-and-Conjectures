To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

From the given information:
P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A and Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Now, we calculate the likelihoods:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B))
       = (8/81 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2 + 2/81 * 1/2)
       = 4/5

P(B|E) = 1 - P(A|E) = 1/5

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 4}
