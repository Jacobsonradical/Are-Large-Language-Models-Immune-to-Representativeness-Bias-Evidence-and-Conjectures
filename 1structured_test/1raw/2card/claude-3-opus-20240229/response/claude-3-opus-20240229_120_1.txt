To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the deck is selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

The odds of A given D is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5) = 0.1975 / 0.0247 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8 to 1.
