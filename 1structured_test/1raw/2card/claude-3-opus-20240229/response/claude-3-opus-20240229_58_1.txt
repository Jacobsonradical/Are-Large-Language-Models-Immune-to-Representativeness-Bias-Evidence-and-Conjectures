To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), the posterior odds of A compared to B.

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate:

P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]
       = (32/81) * (1/2) / [(32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2)]
       = 16/40 / (16/40 + 4/40)
       = 16/20
       = 4/5

P(B|E) = 1 - P(A|E) = 1/5

Therefore, the posterior odds of A compared to B is:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4/1 = 4
