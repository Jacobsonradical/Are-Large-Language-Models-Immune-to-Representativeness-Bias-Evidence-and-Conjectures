To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

Prior probabilities:
P(A) = 0.5 (assuming equal chance of selecting either deck)
P(B) = 0.5

Likelihoods:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Posterior probabilities:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]
= (8/81 * 0.5) / [(8/81 * 0.5) + (2/81 * 0.5)]
= 4/5

P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]
= (2/81 * 0.5) / [(8/81 * 0.5) + (2/81 * 0.5)]
= 1/5

Posterior odds:
Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

{odds: 4}
