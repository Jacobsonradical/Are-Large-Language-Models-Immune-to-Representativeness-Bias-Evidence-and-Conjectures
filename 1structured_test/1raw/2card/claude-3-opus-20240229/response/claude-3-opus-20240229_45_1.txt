To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the observed event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the deck was selected by chance, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B):
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds is the ratio of these likelihoods:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
