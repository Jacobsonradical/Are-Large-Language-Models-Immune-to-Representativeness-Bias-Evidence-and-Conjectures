To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is denoted as E.

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The posterior odds are P(A|E) / P(B|E), which can be calculated as:

[P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- The prior probability of selecting each deck is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Calculation:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4C3 = 32/243
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4C3 = 8/243

Posterior odds = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]
               = (32/243 * 1/2) / (8/243 * 1/2)
               = 32/8
               = 4/1
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
