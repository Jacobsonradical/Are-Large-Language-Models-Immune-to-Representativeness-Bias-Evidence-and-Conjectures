To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal chance of selecting either deck)
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Note: C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which cancels out in the calculation.

Calculation:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5)
                = (8/27 * 0.5) / (1/27 * 0.5)
                = 8/1
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8 to 1.
