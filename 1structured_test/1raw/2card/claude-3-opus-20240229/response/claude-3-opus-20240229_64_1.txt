To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find the odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the deck was selected by chance, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

Now, we calculate the likelihoods:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
