To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The selected deck is deck A
B: The selected deck is deck B
D: The drawn cards are 3 X and 1 O

We want to find the ratio P(A|D) / P(B|D), which represents the posterior odds.

Given:
- In deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (the deck was selected by chance)

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A and deck B.
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Step 2: Calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem.
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since P(A) = P(B), they cancel out in the ratio.

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
