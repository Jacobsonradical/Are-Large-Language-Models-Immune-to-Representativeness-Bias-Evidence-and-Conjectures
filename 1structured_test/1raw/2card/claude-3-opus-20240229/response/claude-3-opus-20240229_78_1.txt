To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is denoted as E.

We want to find the odds of A given E, which is:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (equal chance of selecting either deck)
- P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
- P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/243 * 1/2) / (8/243 * 1/2) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
