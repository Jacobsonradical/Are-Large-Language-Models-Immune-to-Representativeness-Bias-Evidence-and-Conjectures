To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (the deck was selected by chance)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5)
                = 8/81 / 2/81
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
