To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

The posterior odds are given by:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

where C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient (4 choose 3), which equals 4.

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds are 3 to 1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
