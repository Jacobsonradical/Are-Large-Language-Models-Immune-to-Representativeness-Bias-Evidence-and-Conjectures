To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards have 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3 to 1.
