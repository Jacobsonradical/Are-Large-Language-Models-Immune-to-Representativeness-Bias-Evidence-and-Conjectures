To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as E, and the decks A and B as A and B, respectively.

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A, which follows a binomial distribution:
P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

Similarly, P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B:
P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/81) * (1/2)) / ((8/81) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
