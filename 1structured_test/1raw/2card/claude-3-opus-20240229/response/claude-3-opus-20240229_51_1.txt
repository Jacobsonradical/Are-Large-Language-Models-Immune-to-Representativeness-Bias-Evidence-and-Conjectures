To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/243) * (1/2)) / ((8/243) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
