To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: the selected deck is A
- B: the selected deck is B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

To find P(D|A) and P(D|B), we use the binomial probability formula:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5)
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
