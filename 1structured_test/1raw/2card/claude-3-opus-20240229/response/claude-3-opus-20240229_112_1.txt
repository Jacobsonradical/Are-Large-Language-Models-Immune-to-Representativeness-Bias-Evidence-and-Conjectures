To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987654321

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0246913580

C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

Substituting these values into the equation:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.0987654321 * 0.5) / (0.0246913580 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
