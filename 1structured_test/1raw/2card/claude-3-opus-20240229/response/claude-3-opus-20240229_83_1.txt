To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as E, and the decks A and B as A and B, respectively.

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- Prior probabilities: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal likelihood of selecting either deck)

Step 1: Calculate P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability formula.
P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81
P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the posterior odds.
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/81) * (1/2)) / ((8/81) * (1/2))
                = (32/81) / (8/81)
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
