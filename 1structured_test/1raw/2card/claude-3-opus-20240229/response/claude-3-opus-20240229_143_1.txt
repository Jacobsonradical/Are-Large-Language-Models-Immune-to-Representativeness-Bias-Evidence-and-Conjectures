To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal prior probability of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Calculation:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 0.5] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 0.5]
                = (8/27) / (2/27)
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
