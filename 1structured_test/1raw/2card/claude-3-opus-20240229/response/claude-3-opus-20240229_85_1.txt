To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as E, and the decks A and B as A and B, respectively.

The posterior odds are given by:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A:
P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B:
P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

{odds: 4}
