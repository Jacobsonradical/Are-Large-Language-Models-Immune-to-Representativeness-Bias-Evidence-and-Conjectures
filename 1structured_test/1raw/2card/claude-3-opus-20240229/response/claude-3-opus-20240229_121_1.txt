Let's solve this step-by-step using Bayes' theorem.

1) Let's denote the event of selecting deck A as A, and selecting deck B as B. The prior probability of selecting each deck is the same, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

2) Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as D (for data).

3) If the cards were drawn from deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is:

   P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

4) If the cards were drawn from deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O is:

   P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

5) The posterior odds of A to B is the ratio of their posterior probabilities:

   P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                   = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)
                   = 8/2
                   = 4/1
                   = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
