To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the selected deck is A
B: the selected deck is B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(4,3) = 0.0329

The odds of A given D is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.0987 / P(D)) / (0.0329 / P(D)) = 0.0987 / 0.0329 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 3 to 1.
