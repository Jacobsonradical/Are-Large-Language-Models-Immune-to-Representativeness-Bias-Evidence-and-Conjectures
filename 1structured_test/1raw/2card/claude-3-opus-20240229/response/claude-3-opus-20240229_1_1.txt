To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5)
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
