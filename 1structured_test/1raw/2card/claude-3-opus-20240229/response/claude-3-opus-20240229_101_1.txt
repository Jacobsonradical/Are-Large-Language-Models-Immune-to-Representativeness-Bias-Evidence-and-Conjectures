To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities are:
P(A) = 1/2 (assuming the deck was selected by chance)
P(B) = 1/2

The likelihoods are:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior probabilities are:
P(A|E) = (32/243) * (1/2) / P(E)
P(B|E) = (8/243) * (1/2) / P(E)

The posterior odds is the ratio of these probabilities:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = ((32/243) * (1/2)) / ((8/243) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
