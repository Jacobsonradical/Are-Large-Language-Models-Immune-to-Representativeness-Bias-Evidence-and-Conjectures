To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the ratio P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

The posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5) = 0.0987 / 0.0329 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 3}
