To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
X: 3 out of 4 cards are marked X

We want to find the odds of A given X, which is P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(4,3) = 0.1975
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(4,3) = 0.0247

C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5)
                = 0.1975 / 0.0247
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8 to 1.
