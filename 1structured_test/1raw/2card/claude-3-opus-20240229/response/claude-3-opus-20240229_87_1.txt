To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as D, and the event of selecting deck A as A.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)

We know that:
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3), where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4.
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3)
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, as the deck is selected by chance.

To find P(D), we use the law of total probability:
P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)

Now, let's calculate:
C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 4 = 32/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 4 = 8/81

P(D) = (32/81 * 1/2) + (8/81 * 1/2) = 20/81

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (32/81 * 1/2) / (20/81) = 16/20 = 4/5

The posterior odds are the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D), which is the same as the ratio of P(A|D) to (1 - P(A|D)):

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / (1 - P(A|D)) = (4/5) / (1 - 4/5) = 4/1 = 4
