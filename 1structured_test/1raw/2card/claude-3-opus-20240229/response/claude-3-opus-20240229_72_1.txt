To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities of selecting each deck are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

In Deck A, P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975
In Deck B, P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5)
                = 0.1975 / 0.0247
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8 to 1.

{odds: 8}
