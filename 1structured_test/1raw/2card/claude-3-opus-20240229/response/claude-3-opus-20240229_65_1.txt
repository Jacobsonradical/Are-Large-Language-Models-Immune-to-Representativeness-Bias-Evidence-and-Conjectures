To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards have 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, which follows a binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

Similarly, P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

The posterior odds is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D), which simplifies to:

(P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B)) = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
