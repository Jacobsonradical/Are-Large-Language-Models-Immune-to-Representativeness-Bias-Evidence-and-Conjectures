To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find:
P(A|E) : P(B|E)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A: 
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) : P(B|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) : P(E|B) * P(B)
                = 0.1975 * 0.5 : 0.0247 * 0.5
                = 0.09875 : 0.01235
                = 8 : 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 8:1.

{odds: 8}
