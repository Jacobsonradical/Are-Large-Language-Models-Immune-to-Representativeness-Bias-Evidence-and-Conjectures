To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The odds of A given E is:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/243 * 1/2) / (8/243 * 1/2) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
