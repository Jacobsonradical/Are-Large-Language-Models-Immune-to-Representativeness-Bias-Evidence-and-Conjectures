Let's solve this using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B the event that they were drawn from Deck B.
Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each), as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/243) * 0.5) / ((8/243) * 0.5)
                = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.

{odds: 4}
