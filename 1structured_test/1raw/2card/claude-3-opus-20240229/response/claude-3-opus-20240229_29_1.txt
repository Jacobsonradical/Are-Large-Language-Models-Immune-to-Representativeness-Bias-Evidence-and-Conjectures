To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so they cancel out:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Now, we calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck using the binomial distribution:

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Substituting these values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
