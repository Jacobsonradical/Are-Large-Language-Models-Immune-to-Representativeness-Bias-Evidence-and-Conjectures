To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define some events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we're comparing odds, the P(D) term cancels out. Also, since the deck was selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now we need to calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B), the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A: P(D|A) = C(2/3, 3) * C(1/3, 1) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

For Deck B: P(D|B) = C(1/3, 3) * C(2/3, 1) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
