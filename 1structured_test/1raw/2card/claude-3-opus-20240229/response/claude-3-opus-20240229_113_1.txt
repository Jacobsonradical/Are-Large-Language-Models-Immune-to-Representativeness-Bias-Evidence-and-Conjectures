To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, drawing from Deck B as B, and the observed cards (3 X and 1 O) as D.

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) because the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
