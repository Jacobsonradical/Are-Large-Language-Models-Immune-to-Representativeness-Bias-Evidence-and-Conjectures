To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck)
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

We need to calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B):

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Here, C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
                = [(32/243) * 0.5] / [(8/243) * 0.5]
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
