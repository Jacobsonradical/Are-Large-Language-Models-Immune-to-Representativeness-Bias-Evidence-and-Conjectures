To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the deck was selected by chance, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
