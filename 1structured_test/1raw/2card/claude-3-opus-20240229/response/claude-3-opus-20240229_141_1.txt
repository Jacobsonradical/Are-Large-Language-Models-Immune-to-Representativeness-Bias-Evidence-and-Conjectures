To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The posterior odds are given by P(A|D) / P(B|D), which can be expanded using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- Prior probabilities: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal likelihood of selecting either deck)

Calculation:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
               = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)
               = 8/2
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
