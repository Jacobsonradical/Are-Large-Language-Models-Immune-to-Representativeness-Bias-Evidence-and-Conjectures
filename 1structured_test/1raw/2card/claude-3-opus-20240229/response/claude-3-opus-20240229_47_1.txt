To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The evidence is the drawn cards: 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A and Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so they cancel out.

In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3.
In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3.

P(3X,1O|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
P(3X,1O|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 4}
