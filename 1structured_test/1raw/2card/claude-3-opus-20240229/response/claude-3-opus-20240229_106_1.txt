To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

In Deck A, P(drawing an X) = 2/3 and P(drawing an O) = 1/3.
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

In Deck B, P(drawing an X) = 1/3 and P(drawing an O) = 2/3.
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Substituting:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * 0.5] / [(2/81) * 0.5] = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
