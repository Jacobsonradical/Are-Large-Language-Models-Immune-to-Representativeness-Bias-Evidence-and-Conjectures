To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Given:
- P(E|A) = C(3,2/3) * C(1,1/3) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
- P(E|B) = C(3,1/3) * C(1,2/3) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = ((8/81) * (1/2)) / ((2/81) * (1/2))
                = (8/81) / (2/81)
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
