To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to calculate the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

To find P(D|A), we calculate the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987654321

Similarly, for P(D|B):
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0049382716

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987654321 * 0.5) / (0.0049382716 * 0.5)
                = 20

Therefore, the posterior odds are 20 to 1 in favor of Deck A.
