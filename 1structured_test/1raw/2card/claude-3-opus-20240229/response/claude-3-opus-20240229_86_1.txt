To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities)

Calculation:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/81 * 4 = 32/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 2/81 * 8 = 16/81

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/81 * 1/2) / (16/81 * 1/2) = 32/16 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds are 2:1 in favor of Deck A.
