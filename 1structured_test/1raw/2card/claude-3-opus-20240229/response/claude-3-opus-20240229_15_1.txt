To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down step by step.

Given:
- In deck A, P(X|A) = 2/3 and P(O|A) = 1/3
- In deck B, P(X|B) = 1/3 and P(O|B) = 2/3
- 4 cards drawn: 3 marked X and 1 marked O

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck A.
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X and 1 O from deck B.
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds using Bayes' theorem.
Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting deck A or B, P(A) / P(B) = 1.

Posterior odds = (8/81) / (2/81) * 1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
