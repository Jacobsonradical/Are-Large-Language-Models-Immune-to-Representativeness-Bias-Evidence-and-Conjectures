To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

We want to find the ratio P(A|D) / P(B|D), which is the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
