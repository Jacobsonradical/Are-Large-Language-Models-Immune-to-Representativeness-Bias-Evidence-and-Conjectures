To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, drawing from Deck B as B, and the observed cards (3 X and 1 O) as D.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) : P(B|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) : P(D|B) * P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities of selecting each deck)
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

Likelihood of observing the data given Deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

Likelihood of observing the data given Deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Posterior odds:
P(A|D) : P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) : (2/81 * 0.5) = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
