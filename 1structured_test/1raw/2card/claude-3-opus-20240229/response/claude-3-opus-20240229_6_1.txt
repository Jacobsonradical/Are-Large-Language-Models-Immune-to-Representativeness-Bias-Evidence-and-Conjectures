To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. We also denote the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as D (for data).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting either deck)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

Where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is equal to 4.

Plugging in the values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5) = 0.09875 / 0.01235 â‰ˆ 8

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is approximately 8 to 1.
