To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3 to 1.
