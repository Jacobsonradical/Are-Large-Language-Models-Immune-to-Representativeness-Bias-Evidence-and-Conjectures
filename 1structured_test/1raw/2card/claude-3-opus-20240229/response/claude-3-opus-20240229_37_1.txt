To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we don't know which deck was selected, we assume P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

In Deck A, P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987654321
In Deck B, P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0246913580

The odds of A given D is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (0.0987654321 * 0.5) / (0.0246913580 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
