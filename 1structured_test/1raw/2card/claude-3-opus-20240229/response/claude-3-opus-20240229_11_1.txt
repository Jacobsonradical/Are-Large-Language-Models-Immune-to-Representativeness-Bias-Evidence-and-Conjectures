To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define some events:
- A: the selected deck is A
- B: the selected deck is B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck is selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 3}
