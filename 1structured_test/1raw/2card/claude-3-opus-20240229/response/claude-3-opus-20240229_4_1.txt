To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to calculate P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Where:
- P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
- P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively

Assuming the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0494
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

Where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is equal to 4.

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0494 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5)
                = 0.0247 / 0.01235
                = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
{odds: 2}
