To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define the events:

- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We need to calculate P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((8/81) * (1/2)) / ((2/81) * (1/2))
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds are 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A.
