To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds of A to B given D, which is:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, the odds simplify to:

P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987654321
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329218107

where C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient (4 choose 3) = 4.

Substituting these values:

Posterior odds = 0.0987654321 / 0.0329218107 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 3 to 1.
