To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so they cancel out:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
