To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

Substituting these values:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 3:1.
