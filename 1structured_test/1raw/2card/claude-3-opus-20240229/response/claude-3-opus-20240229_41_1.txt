To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: the selected deck is A
B: the selected deck is B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to calculate P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (the decks are selected by chance)
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243 (binomial probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243 (binomial probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243 * 1/2) / (8/243 * 1/2) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
