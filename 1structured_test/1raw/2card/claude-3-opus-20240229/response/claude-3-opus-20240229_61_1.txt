To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- The prior probability of selecting either deck is equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Step 1: Calculate the likelihood of observing the data given Deck A, P(D|A).
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4C3) = 32/243

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing the data given Deck B, P(D|B).
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4C3) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/243) * (1/2)) / ((8/243) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4/1 or 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
