To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The prior odds of drawing from Deck A compared to Deck B is 1:1, as the deck was selected by chance.

The likelihood of observing the data (3 X and 1 O) given Deck A is:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The likelihood of observing the data (3 X and 1 O) given Deck B is:
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds is the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:
Posterior Odds = (1/1) * (P(D|A) / P(D|B)) = (1/1) * ((8/81) / (2/81)) = 4/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
