To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 marked X and 1 marked O

We want to calculate P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the deck was selected by chance, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
