To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the selected deck is deck A
B: the selected deck is deck B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4:1.

{odds: 4}
