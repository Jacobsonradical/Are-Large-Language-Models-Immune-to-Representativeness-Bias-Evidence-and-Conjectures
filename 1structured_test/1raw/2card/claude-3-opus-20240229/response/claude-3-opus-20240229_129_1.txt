To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 Xs and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|D) = (8/81) * 0.5 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (2/81) * 0.5 / P(D)

The denominators are the same, so they cancel out when we compute the odds:

Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
