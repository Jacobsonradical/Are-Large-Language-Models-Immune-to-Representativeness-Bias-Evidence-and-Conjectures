To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The evidence, E, is that we've drawn 3 X cards and 1 O card.

Given:
P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), the posterior odds.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
