To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the selected deck is A
- B: the selected deck is B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (the deck is selected by chance)
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243 (using the binomial probability formula)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Now, let's calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/243) * (1/2)) / ((8/243) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
