To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- Prior probabilities: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Step 1: Calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability formula:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/81) * (1/2)) / ((8/81) * (1/2))
                = 32/8
                = 4/1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
