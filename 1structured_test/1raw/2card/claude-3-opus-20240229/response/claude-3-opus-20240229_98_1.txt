To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

From Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

The odds of A given E is:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 3}
