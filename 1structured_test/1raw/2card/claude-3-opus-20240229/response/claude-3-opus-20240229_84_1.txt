To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

The posterior odds is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D), which simplifies to:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((32/81) * 0.5) / ((8/81) * 0.5)
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
