To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since the deck is selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

In Deck A, P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
In Deck B, P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) = 0.0987 * 0.5 + 0.0329 * 0.5 = 0.0658

So, P(A|D) = 0.0987 * 0.5 / 0.0658 = 0.75
and P(B|D) = 0.0329 * 0.5 / 0.0658 = 0.25

The posterior odds are P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 0.75 / 0.25 = 3
