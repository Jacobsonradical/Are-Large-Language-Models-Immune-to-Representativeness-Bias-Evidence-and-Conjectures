To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define some events:

A: the selected deck is A
B: the selected deck is B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
