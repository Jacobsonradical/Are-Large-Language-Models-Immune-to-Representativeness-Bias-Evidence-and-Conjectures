To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as D.

The posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal chance of selecting either deck)
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

Step 1: Calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability formula.

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81 ≈ 0.3951
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81 ≈ 0.0988

Step 2: Calculate the posterior odds.

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.3951 * 0.5) / (0.0988 * 0.5)
                = 0.19755 / 0.0494
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
