To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 Xs and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A to B given D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5)
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
