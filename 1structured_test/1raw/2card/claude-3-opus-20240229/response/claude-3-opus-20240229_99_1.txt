To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data, denoted as D, is drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. Thus, the terms cancel out:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = P(D|A) / P(D|B)

Now, let's calculate P(D|A) and P(D|B) using the binomial probability formula:

P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 32/8 = 4

{odds: 4}
