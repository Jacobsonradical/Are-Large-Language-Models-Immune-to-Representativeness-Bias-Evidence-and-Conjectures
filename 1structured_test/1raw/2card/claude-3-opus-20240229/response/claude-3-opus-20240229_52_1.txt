To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The posterior odds is then:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Given:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B)

Substituting:

Posterior odds = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
               = 8/81 / 2/81
               = 8/2
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
