To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as E, and the decks A and B as A and B, respectively.

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Step 1: Calculate P(E|A), the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
P(E|A) = C(4,3) × (2/3)^3 × (1/3)^1 = 4 × (8/27) × (1/3) = 32/81

Step 2: Calculate P(E|B), the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
P(E|B) = C(4,3) × (1/3)^3 × (2/3)^1 = 4 × (1/27) × (2/3) = 8/81

Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|E) and P(B|E).
P(A|E) = (P(E|A) × P(A)) / (P(E|A) × P(A) + P(E|B) × P(B))
       = (32/81 × 1/2) / (32/81 × 1/2 + 8/81 × 1/2)
       = 16/20 = 4/5

P(B|E) = (P(E|B) × P(B)) / (P(E|A) × P(A) + P(E|B) × P(B))
       = (8/81 × 1/2) / (32/81 × 1/2 + 8/81 × 1/2)
       = 4/20 = 1/5

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds P(A|E) / P(B|E).
Posterior odds = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
