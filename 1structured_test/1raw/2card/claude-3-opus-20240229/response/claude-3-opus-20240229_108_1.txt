To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from deck B
- D: the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

To find P(D|A) and P(D|B), we use the binomial probability formula:
P(D|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/81 * 1/3 = 32/243
P(D|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/243

The posterior odds is then:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243) / (8/243) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4 to 1.
