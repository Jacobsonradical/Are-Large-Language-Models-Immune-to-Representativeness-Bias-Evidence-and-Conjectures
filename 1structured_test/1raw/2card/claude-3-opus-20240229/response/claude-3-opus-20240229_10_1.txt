To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5).

In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3. 
In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3.

Using the multinomial distribution, we can calculate:

P(D|A) = (4C3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

P(D|B) = (4C3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

Substituting these values into the posterior odds formula:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
