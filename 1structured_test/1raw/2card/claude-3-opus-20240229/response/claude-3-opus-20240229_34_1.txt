To calculate the posterior odds, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- P(A) = probability of selecting deck A = 1/2
- P(B) = probability of selecting deck B = 1/2
- P(X|A) = probability of drawing a card marked X from deck A = 2/3
- P(O|A) = probability of drawing a card marked O from deck A = 1/3
- P(X|B) = probability of drawing a card marked X from deck B = 1/3
- P(O|B) = probability of drawing a card marked O from deck B = 2/3

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from deck A:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

The probability of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O from deck B:
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of deck A given the drawn cards:
P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]
            = (8/81 * 1/2) / [(8/81 * 1/2) + (2/81 * 1/2)]
            = 4/5

The posterior probability of deck B given the drawn cards:
P(B|3X, 1O) = 1 - P(A|3X, 1O) = 1/5

The posterior odds of deck A compared to deck B:
Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
