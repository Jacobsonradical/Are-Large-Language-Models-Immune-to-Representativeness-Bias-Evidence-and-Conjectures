To calculate the posterior odds, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let D be the observed data, which is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The posterior odds are P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Posterior odds = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
