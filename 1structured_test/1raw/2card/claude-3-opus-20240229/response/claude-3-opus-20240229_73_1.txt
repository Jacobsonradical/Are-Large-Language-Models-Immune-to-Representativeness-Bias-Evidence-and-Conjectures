To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
D: the drawn cards have 3 marked X and 1 marked O

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
P(D|A) = C(3, 2/3) * C(1, 1/3) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

P(D|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(D|B) = C(3, 1/3) * C(1, 2/3) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5)
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
