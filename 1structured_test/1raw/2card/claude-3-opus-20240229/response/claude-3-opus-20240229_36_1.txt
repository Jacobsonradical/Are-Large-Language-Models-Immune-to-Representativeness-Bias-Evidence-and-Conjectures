To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal, as the deck was selected by chance. So, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihoods P(E|A) and P(E|B) using the binomial probability formula:

P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
