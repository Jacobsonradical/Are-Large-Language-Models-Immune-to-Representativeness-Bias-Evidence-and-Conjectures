To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the selected deck is Deck A
B: the selected deck is Deck B
D: the drawn cards are 3 X and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of Deck A being selected given the drawn cards.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 32/243
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * (4 choose 3) = 8/243

The posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/243 * 0.5) / (8/243 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
