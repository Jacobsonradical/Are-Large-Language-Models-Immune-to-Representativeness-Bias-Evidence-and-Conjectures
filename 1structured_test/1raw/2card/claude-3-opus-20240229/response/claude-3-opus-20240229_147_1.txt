To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: the cards were drawn from deck A
B: the cards were drawn from deck B
D: the drawn cards have 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

The posterior odds is P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- In deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
- In deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3
- Prior probabilities: P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Calculate the likelihoods:
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
              = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2)
              = 8/2
              = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 4 to 1.
