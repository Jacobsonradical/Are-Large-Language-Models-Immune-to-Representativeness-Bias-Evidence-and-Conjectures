To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the ratio P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient, equal to 4 in this case.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3:1.
