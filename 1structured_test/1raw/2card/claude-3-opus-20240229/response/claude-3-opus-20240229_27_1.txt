To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards consist of 3 marked X and 1 marked O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Given:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal probability of selecting each deck)
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Substituting:
P(A|D) = (8/81) * 0.5 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (2/81) * 0.5 / P(D)

The posterior odds is the ratio of these probabilities:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((8/81) * 0.5 / P(D)) / ((2/81) * 0.5 / P(D))

Simplifying:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
