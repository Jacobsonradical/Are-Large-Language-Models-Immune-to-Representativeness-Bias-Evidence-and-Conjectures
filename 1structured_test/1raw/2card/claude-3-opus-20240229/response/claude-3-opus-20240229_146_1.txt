To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of selecting Deck A as A, selecting Deck B as B, and drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card as D (data).

We want to find the odds of A given D, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) since the deck was selected by chance.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck:

Deck A: P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
Deck B: P(B|A) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equations:

P(A|D) = (8/81) * 0.5 / P(D)
P(B|D) = (2/81) * 0.5 / P(D)

The posterior odds is the ratio of these probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4 to 1.
