To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We need to calculate P(A|E) / P(B|E), which is the posterior odds of A compared to B given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
