To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to calculate P(A|D) / P(B|D), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data D.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = ((8/81) * (1/2)) / ((2/81) * (1/2))
                = (8/81) / (2/81)
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
