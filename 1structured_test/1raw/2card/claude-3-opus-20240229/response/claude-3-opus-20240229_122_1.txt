To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
D: The drawn cards have 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find P(A|D) / P(B|D), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Since we are only interested in the odds, we can ignore P(D) as it will cancel out when dividing P(A|D) by P(B|D).

P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Posterior odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
