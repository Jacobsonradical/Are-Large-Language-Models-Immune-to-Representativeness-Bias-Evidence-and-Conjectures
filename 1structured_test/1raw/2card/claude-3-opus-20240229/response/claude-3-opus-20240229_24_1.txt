To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: the cards were drawn from deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to calculate P(A|E) / P(B|E), the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from deck A compared to deck B, given the observed event E.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5)
                = 8/2
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
