Let's approach this step-by-step using Bayes' theorem.

1) Let's define our events:
   A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
   B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
   D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

2) We need to calculate P(A|D), the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the drawn cards.

   P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)

3) P(D|A), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * (8/27) * (1/3) = 32/81

4) Similarly, P(D|B), the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:

   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * (1/27) * (2/3) = 8/81

5) Assuming the deck was selected by chance, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

6) P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)
        = (32/81) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2)
        = 20/81

7) Now we can calculate P(A|D):

   P(A|D) = (32/81) * (1/2) / (20/81) = 16/20 = 4/5

8) The posterior odds are the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D), which is the same as the ratio of P(A|D) to (1 - P(A|D)):

   Posterior odds = (4/5) / (1 - 4/5) = 4/1 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
