To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given X.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Assuming the decks were selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

In Deck A, P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987654321
In Deck B, P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329218107

C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient, equal to 4 choose 3 = 4.

Substituting:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.0987654321 * 0.5) / (0.0329218107 * 0.5) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds are 3 to 1 in favor of Deck A.
