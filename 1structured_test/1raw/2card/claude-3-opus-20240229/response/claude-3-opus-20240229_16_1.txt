To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: Deck A is selected
B: Deck B is selected
D: Drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to find the odds of A compared to B, given D. The odds are calculated as P(A|D) / P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)
P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)

The odds can be simplified to:
Odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Given:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal chances of selecting either deck)
P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

Plugging in the values:
Odds = ((8/81) * 0.5) / ((2/81) * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.

{odds: 4}
