To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to find the odds of A given X, which is P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (32/243 + 8/243) * 0.5 = 20/243

Therefore,
P(A|X) = (32/243) * 0.5 / (20/243) = 16/20 = 4/5
P(B|X) = (8/243) * 0.5 / (20/243) = 4/20 = 1/5

The odds of A given X is P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4.
