To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
Let X be the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(X|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
P(X|A) = C(3,2/3) * C(1,1/3) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81

P(X|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(X|B) = C(3,1/3) * C(1,2/3) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Now, the posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
