To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define some events:

- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: the event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

We want to calculate the odds of A given E, which is P(A|E) / P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A, which follows a binomial distribution:
P(E|A) = C(4,3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 4 * 8/27 * 1/3 = 32/81

Similarly, P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
P(E|B) = C(4,3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 4 * 1/27 * 2/3 = 8/81

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = (32/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5)
                = 32/8
                = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
