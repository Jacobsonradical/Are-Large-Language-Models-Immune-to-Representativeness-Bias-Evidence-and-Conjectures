To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is denoted as E.

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The posterior odds are P(A|E) / P(B|E), which can be simplified to:

P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|B) * P(B))

Now, let's calculate each term:

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting each deck)

Substituting these values:

Posterior odds = (32/243 * 1/2) / (8/243 * 1/2) = 32/8 = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

{odds: 4}
