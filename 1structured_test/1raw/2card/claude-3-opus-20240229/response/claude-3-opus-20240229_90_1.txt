To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The evidence is the drawn cards: 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

P(A|Evidence) = P(Evidence|A) * P(A) / P(Evidence)
P(B|Evidence) = P(Evidence|B) * P(B) / P(Evidence)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) as the deck was selected by chance.

In Deck A, P(X) = 2/3 and P(O) = 1/3
In Deck B, P(X) = 1/3 and P(O) = 2/3

P(Evidence|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(Evidence|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

The posterior odds are:
P(A|Evidence) / P(B|Evidence) = (8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

So the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
