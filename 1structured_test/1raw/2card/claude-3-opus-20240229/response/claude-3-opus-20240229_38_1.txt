To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card is denoted as E.

We want to find P(A|E) / P(B|E), which are the posterior odds.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal since the deck was selected by chance, so they cancel out in the odds ratio.

P(E|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A:
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987

P(E|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

The posterior odds are:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 0.0987 / 0.0329 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3 to 1.
