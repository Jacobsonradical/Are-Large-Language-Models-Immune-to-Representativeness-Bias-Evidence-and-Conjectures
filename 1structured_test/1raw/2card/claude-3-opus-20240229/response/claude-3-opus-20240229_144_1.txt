To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 4 cards with 3 marked X and 1 marked O as E, and the decks A and B as A and B, respectively.

The posterior odds are given by:
P(A|E) : P(B|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) : P(E|B) * P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the deck was selected by chance)
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3

Step 1: Calculate P(E|A)
P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

Step 2: Calculate P(E|B)
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
P(A|E) : P(B|E) = (32/243) * (1/2) : (8/243) * (1/2)
                = 32 : 8
                = 4 : 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
