To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: the cards were drawn from deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from deck B
- D: the drawn cards are 3 X's and 1 O

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of P(A|D) to P(B|D).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5) as the deck was selected by chance.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * C(4,3) = 0.1975
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * C(4,3) = 0.0247

Where C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

The posterior odds is:
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
                = (0.1975 * 0.5) / (0.0247 * 0.5)
                = 0.1975 / 0.0247
                = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from deck A compared to deck B is 8 to 1.
