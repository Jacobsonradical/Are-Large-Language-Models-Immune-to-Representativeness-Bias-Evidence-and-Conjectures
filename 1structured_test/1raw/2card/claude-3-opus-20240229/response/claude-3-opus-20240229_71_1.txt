To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from each deck.

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 32/243

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 8/243

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting either deck, the posterior odds are simply the ratio of these likelihoods:

Posterior Odds = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B)
               = (32/243) / (8/243)
               = 32/8
               = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4 to 1.
