To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the drawn cards have 3 X and 1 O

We want to find P(A|X) / P(B|X), the posterior odds of A compared to B, given X.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) = P(X|A) * P(A) / P(X)
P(B|X) = P(X|B) * P(B) / P(X)

The prior probabilities P(A) and P(B) are equal (0.5 each) since the deck was selected by chance.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0987
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0329

C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 4, which is 4.

The posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (0.0987 * 0.5) / (0.0329 * 0.5)
                = 0.0987 / 0.0329
                = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 3 to 1.
