Let's solve this step-by-step using Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 cards marked X, 1/3 cards marked O
- Deck B: 1/3 cards marked X, 2/3 cards marked O
- 4 cards drawn: 3 marked X, 1 marked O

Let's define the events:
- A: Cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: Cards were drawn from Deck B
- E: The drawn cards have 3 X and 1 O

We need to find the posterior odds: P(A|E) / P(B|E)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

We assume that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or B are equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.1975
P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * C(4,3) = 0.0247

C(4,3) is the binomial coefficient (4 choose 3), which equals 4.

Now, the posterior odds:
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|B) * P(B))
                = (0.1975 * 1/2) / (0.0247 * 1/2)
                = 0.1975 / 0.0247
                = 7.9959

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are approximately 8 to 1.

{odds: 7.9959}
