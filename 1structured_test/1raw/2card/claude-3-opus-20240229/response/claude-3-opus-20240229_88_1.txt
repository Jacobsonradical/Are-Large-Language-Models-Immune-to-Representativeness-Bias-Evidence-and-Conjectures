To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing from Deck A as A, and drawing from Deck B as B. The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O, which we'll denote as D.

The posterior odds are: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)
P(B|D) = P(D|B) * P(B) / P(D)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for selecting Deck A or B, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

(8/81 * 0.5) / (2/81 * 0.5) = 8/2 = 4

{odds: 4}
