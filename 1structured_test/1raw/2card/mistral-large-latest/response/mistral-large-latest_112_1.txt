To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( E \): The event of drawing 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

We need to calculate \( P(A|E) \) and \( P(B|E) \), and then find the ratio \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the deck is chosen by chance), we need to calculate \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

### Calculating \( P(E|A) \)
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(E|B) \)
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(E|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Calculating the Posterior Odds
The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
