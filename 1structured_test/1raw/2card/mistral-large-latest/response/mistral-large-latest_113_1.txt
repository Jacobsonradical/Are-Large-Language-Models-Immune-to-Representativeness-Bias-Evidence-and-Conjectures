To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Since the decks are chosen by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
