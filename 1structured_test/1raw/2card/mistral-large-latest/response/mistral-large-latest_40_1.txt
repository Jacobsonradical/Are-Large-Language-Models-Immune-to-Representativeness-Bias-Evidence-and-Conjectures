To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to calculate \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \), and then find the ratio \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, calculate the likelihoods:

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
  \[
  P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
  \[
  P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of choosing either deck are equal:
\[
P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

The denominator \( P(D) \) is the same for both:
\[
P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81}
\]

So,
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

The posterior odds are:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4
\]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
