To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. We will use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

First, let's define the prior probabilities and likelihoods:

- Prior probability of selecting Deck A: \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- Prior probability of selecting Deck B: \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(A | \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{3X, 1O})} \]
\[ P(B | \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{3X, 1O})} \]

The denominator \( P(\text{3X, 1O}) \) is the same for both and can be calculated as:
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O}) = P(\text{3X, 1O} | A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{3X, 1O} | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(\text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{32}{81} \times 0.5 + \frac{8}{81} \times 0.5 = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

Now, calculate the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(A | \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B | \text{3X, 1O}) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \times 0.5}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \]

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are:
\[ \frac{P(A | \text{3X, 1O})}{P(B | \text{3X, 1O})} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
