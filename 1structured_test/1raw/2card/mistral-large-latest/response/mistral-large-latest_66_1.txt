To solve this problem, we need to compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Assuming the decks are equally likely to be chosen, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(D|A) \)
In Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(D|B) \)
In Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
