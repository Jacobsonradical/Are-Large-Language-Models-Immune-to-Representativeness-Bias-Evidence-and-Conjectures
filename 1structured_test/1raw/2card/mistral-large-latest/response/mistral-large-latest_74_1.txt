To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, we calculate the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

### Likelihood Calculations

#### Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

#### Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Prior Odds
Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Posterior Odds Calculation
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
