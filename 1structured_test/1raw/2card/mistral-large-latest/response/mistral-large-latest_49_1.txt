To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B. Let \( E \) be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to calculate \( P(A|E) \) and \( P(B|E) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E|B)P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), the prior odds are 1:1.

Now, we need to calculate \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, substituting these into the posterior odds formula:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
