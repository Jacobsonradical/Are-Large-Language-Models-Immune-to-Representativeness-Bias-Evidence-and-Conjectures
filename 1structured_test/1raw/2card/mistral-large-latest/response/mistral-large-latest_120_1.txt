To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). We'll use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let \( A \) denote the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) denote the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( D \) denote the observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the prior odds are 1:1. Thus, the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

### Calculating \( P(D|A) \)

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(D|B) \)

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds

Now, we calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1.
