To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 Xs and 1 O).

First, let's define the prior probabilities and likelihoods:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since one of the decks is selected by chance)

- Likelihoods:
  - For Deck A:
    - \( P(\text{X} | A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
    - \( P(\text{O} | A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - For Deck B:
    - \( P(\text{X} | B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
    - \( P(\text{O} | B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Given the observed data (3 Xs and 1 O), the likelihood of this data given each deck is:

- Likelihood for Deck A:
  \[
  P(\text{Data} | A) = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

- Likelihood for Deck B:
  \[
  P(\text{Data} | B) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{81}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | \text{Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Data})}
\]
\[
P(B | \text{Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Data})}
\]

The posterior odds ratio is:

\[
\frac{P(A | \text{Data})}{P(B | \text{Data})} = \frac{P(\text{Data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Data} | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{2}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
