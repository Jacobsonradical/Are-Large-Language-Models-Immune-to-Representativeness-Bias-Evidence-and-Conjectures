To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \) is the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) is the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) is the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \), and then calculate the odds ratio \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(D|A) \)
For Deck A, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(D|B) \)
For Deck B, the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \), the posterior odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = 4 \]

### Conclusion
The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
