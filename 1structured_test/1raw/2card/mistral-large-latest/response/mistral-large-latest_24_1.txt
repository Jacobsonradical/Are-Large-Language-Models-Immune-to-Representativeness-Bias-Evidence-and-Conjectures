To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are then:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
