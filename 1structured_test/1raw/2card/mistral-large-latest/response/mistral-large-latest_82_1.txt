To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. We will use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is selected by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Let \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 \]

Calculating these probabilities:
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
