To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about which deck the cards were drawn from, given the observed evidence.

Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( E \) be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, we calculate the probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

### Probability for Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Probability for Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds:
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the evidence \( E \) is the ratio of the probabilities:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal (\( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
