To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about which deck the cards were drawn from based on the evidence provided.

Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( E \) be the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to find the posterior odds of \( A \) given \( E \), which is \( \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.

\[
\boxed{\text{{odds: 4}}}
\]
