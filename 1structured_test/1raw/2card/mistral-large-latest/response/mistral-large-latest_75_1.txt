To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to find \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is given by the binomial coefficient and the respective probabilities:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B)P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|B)P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
