To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Since the decks are selected by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
