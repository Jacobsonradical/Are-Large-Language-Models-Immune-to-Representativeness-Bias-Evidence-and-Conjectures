To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about which deck the cards were drawn from based on the evidence provided.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- \( E \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the probabilities of \( A \) and \( B \) given the evidence \( E \):

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

The posterior odds can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming that the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are equal (since the deck was selected by chance), we have:

\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:

\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:

\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
