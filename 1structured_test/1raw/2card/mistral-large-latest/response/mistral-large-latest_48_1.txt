To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote \( A \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and \( B \) as the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

### Likelihood for Deck A:
The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is \( \frac{2}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

\[ P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]

\[ = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Likelihood for Deck B:
The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

\[ P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]

\[ = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]

\[ = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds:
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | A)}{P(\text{3 X's and 1 O} | B)} \]

\[ = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]

\[ = \frac{32}{8} \]

\[ = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
