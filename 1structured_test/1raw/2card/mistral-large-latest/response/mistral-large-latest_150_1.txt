To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). We will use Bayes' theorem to compute these odds.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are equal (since the deck is chosen by chance), we have \( P(A) = P(B) \). Therefore, the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
