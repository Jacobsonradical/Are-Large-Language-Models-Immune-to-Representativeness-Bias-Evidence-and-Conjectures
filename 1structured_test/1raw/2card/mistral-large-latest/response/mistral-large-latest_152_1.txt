To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( P(A|D) \) as the posterior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given the observed data.
- \( P(B|D) \) as the posterior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck B given the observed data.

Assuming the decks were chosen with equal probability, we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
