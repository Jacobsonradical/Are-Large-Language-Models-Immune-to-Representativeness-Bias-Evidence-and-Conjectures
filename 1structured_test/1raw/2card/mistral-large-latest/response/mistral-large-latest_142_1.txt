To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to calculate \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \).

First, we calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

### Likelihood Calculation for Deck A:
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial probability:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Likelihood Calculation for Deck B:
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is given by the binomial probability:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds Calculation:
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the posterior odds simplify to the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
