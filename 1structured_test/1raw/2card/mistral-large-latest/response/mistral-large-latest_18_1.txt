To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( D \). We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, we need the likelihoods of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
  \[
  P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
  \[
  P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

The posterior odds are:
\[
\frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
