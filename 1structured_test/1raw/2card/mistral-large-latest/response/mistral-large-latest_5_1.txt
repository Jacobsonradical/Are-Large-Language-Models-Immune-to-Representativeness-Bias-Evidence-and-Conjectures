To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( D \) be the event that we draw 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to compute \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
