To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( D \) be the event that 3 out of 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We need to calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the posterior odds simplify to:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, calculate the posterior odds:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
