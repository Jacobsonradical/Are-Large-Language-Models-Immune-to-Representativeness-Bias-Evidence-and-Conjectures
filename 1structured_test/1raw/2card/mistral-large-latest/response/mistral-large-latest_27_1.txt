To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( D \). We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B given \( D \).

First, we need the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal (i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) \)), the posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D | A)}{P(D | B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
