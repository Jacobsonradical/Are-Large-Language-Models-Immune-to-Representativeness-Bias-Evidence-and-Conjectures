To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The deck is Deck A.
- \( B \): The deck is Deck B.
- \( D \): The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \), and then compute the odds ratio \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, we calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

### Likelihood Calculation

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Probability Calculation

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \times \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
