To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( E \).

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

### Likelihood Calculation

#### Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
  \[
  P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)
  \]
  \[
  P(E|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
  \]

#### Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
  \[
  P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)
  \]
  \[
  P(E|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
  \]

### Prior Probabilities
Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal:
\[
P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Posterior Odds Calculation
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are given by:
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}
\]
\[
\text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
