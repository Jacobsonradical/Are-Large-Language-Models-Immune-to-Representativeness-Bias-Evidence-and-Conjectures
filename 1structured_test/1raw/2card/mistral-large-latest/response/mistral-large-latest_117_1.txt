To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Given that the decks are selected by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(D|A) \)

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial distribution:

\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]

\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(D|B) \)

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \). The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:

\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]

\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
