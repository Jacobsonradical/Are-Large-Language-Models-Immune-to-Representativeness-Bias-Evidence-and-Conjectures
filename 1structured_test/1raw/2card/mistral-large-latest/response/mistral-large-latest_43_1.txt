To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( E \).

First, we need to calculate the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

### Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E|A) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(E|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Probability of Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order is:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(E|B) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(E|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Posterior Odds:
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the event \( E \) is the ratio of the probabilities:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
