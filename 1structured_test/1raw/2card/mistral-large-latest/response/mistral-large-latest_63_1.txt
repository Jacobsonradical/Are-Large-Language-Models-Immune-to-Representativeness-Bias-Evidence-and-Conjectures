To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

Given that the decks are selected by chance, we can assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(D|A) \)

In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]

\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]

\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Calculating \( P(D|B) \)

In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is given by the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]

\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]

\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Calculating the Posterior Odds

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \), they cancel out:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
