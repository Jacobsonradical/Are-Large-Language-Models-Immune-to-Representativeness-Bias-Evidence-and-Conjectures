To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) as the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \) as the probabilities of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.
- \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \) as the posterior probabilities of having selected Deck A and Deck B, given the observed data \( D \) (3 X's and 1 O).

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(D|A) \)
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{27} \times \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} \]
\[ P(D|A) = \frac{32}{81} \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(D|B) \)
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B can be calculated similarly:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{1}{27} \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} \]
\[ P(D|B) = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]
Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \) (since the deck was selected by chance):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
