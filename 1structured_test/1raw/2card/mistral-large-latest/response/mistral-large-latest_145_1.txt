To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( D \) be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior odds of selecting either deck are equal (i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \)), the posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
