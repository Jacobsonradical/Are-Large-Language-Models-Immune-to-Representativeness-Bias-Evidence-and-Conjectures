To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the deck is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \).

First, we calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The denominator \( P(D) \) is the same for both and can be calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = \frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{40}{162} = \frac{20}{81} \]

So,
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{4}{5} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{20}{81}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \]

The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5}} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
