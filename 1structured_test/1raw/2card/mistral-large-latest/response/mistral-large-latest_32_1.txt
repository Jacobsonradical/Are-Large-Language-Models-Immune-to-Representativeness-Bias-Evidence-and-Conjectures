To compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is chosen by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Let \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(D|A) \):
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck A is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O from Deck A is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(D|B) \):
- The probability of drawing an X from Deck B is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O from Deck B is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
