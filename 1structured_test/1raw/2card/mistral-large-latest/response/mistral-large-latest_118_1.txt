To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the deck chosen is Deck A.
- \( B \) as the event that the deck chosen is Deck B.
- \( D \) as the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds \( \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \).

First, we need to calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

### Likelihood Calculations

#### For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

#### For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

### Prior Odds
Assuming the prior probabilities of choosing Deck A or Deck B are equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Posterior Odds Calculation
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
