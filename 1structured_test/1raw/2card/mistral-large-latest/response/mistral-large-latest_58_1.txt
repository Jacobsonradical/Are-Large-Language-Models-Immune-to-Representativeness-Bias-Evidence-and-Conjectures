To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is selected by chance, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) \), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{27} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
