To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data. We'll use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let \( A \) be the event that the deck is Deck A, and \( B \) be the event that the deck is Deck B. Let \( D \) be the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find \( P(A|D) \) and \( P(B|D) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D|B) P(B)} \]

Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since the decks are chosen by chance), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck A is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in 4 draws from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.

\[
\boxed
{
  \text{{odds: 4}}
}
\]
