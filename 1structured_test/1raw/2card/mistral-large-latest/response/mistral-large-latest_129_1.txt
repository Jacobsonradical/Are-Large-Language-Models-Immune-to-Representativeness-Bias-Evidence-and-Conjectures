To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( E \).

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(E | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(E | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal (i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)), the posterior odds ratio is given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A | E)}{P(B | E)} = \frac{P(E | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
