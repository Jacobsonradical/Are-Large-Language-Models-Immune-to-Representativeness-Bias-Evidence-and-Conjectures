To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. We will use Bayes' theorem to compute these odds.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck is selected by chance, we have:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
