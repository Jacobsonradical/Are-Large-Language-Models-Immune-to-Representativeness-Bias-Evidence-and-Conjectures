To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data (3 X's and 1 O). We'll use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of choosing Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( P(A|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck A given the data.
- \( P(B|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck B given the data.

Assuming the decks were chosen with equal probability:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
