To solve this problem, we need to compute the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data. We can use Bayes' Theorem to find these odds.

Let \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) be the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the deck was selected by chance, we assume \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

Let \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A, and \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = P(B) \), the posterior odds simplify to:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we calculate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X = \( \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O = \( \frac{1}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X = \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we calculate the posterior odds:
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
