To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Let \( P(A) \) be the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
   - Let \( P(B) \) be the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
   - Let \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
   - Let \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.

2. **Calculate \( P(D|A) \):**
   - In Deck A, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck A is given by the binomial probability formula:
     \[
     P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1
     \]
     \[
     P(D|A) = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)
     \]
     \[
     P(D|A) = 4 \times \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81}
     \]

3. **Calculate \( P(D|B) \):**
   - In Deck B, the probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \) and the probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O in any order from Deck B is:
     \[
     P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1
     \]
     \[
     P(D|B) = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)
     \]
     \[
     P(D|B) = 4 \times \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81}
     \]

4. **Calculate the posterior odds:**
   - The posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the data \( D \) is:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}
     \]
   - Assuming \( P(A) = P(B) \) (since the decks are selected by chance), the posterior odds simplify to:
     \[
     \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
     \]

### Conclusion:
The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
