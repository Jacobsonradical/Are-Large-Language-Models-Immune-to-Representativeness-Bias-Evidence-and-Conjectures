To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O as \( D \). We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A (\( A \)) versus Deck B (\( B \)).

First, we need the likelihoods of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of choosing either deck are equal (\( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \)), the posterior odds are given by the ratio of the likelihoods:
\[ \text{Posterior odds} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
