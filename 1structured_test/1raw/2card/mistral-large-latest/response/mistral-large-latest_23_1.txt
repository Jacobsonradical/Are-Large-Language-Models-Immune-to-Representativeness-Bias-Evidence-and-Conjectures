To solve this problem, we need to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B. This involves using Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- \( P(A|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck A given the data.
- \( P(B|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck B given the data.

Assuming the decks are equally likely to be chosen, \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A (where 2/3 of the cards are X and 1/3 are O) is given by the binomial distribution:
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B (where 1/3 of the cards are X and 2/3 are O) is:
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4.
