To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds. Let's denote the probability of drawing from Deck A as \( P(A) \) and from Deck B as \( P(B) \). We assume these probabilities are equal initially, so \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \).

We need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is:
\[ P(\text{data} | A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is:
\[ P(\text{data} | B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs:
\[ P(A | \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data})} \]
\[ P(B | \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{data})} \]

The posterior odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A | \text{data})}{P(B | \text{data})} = \frac{P(\text{data} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{data} | B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
