To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior odds. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \) and \( B \) represent the decks A and B, respectively.
- \( D \) represents the event that 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

We need to find the posterior odds of deck A to deck B given the event \( D \). The posterior odds are given by:

\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, i.e., \( P(A) = P(B) \), the posterior odds simplify to:

\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} \]

Now, we need to compute \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For deck A:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

For deck B:
- The probability of drawing an X is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The probability of drawing an O is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A is:

\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B is:

\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, we can compute the posterior odds:

\[ \frac{P(D|A)}{P(D|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

\[ \boxed {4} \]

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:

```python
{odds: 4}
