To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck A.
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of selecting Deck B.
- \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A.
- \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B.
- \( P(A|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck A given the data (3 X's and 1 O).
- \( P(B|D) \) as the posterior probability of Deck B given the data (3 X's and 1 O).

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal:
\[ P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \]

Next, we calculate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \).

For Deck A (2/3 X, 1/3 O):
\[ P(D|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{8}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{8}{81} = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B (1/3 X, 2/3 O):
\[ P(D|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^1 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{81} = \frac{8}{81} \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

The posterior odds ratio is:
\[ \frac{P(A|D)}{P(B|D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81} \cdot 0.5}{\frac{8}{81} \cdot 0.5} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Thus, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
