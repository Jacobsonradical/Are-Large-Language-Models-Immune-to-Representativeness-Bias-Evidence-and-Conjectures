To determine the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O as \( E \).

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

For Deck A:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck A: \( P(X|A) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck A: \( P(O|A) = \frac{1}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A:
\[ P(E|A) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{8}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{81} \]

For Deck B:
- Probability of drawing an X from Deck B: \( P(X|B) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- Probability of drawing an O from Deck B: \( P(O|B) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
\[ P(E|B) = \binom{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^1 = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{27} \right) \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{8}{81} \]

Next, we calculate the posterior odds of Deck A to Deck B given the event \( E \):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(A|E)}{P(B|E)} = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting either deck are equal, \( P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \text{Posterior Odds} = \frac{P(E|A)}{P(E|B)} = \frac{\frac{32}{81}}{\frac{8}{81}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4.
