Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
* P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  This is calculated using the binomial distribution:
    * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck based on the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 

**6. Simplify**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.  This means that it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, than from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
