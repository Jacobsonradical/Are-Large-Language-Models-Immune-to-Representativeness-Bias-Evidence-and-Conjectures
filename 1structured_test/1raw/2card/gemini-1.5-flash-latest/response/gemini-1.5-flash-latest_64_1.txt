Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that it is four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B.
