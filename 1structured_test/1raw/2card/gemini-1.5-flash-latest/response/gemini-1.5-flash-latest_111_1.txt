Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probabilities of data given each deck):**

*  P(D | A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3) = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D | B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds: P(A | D) / P(B | D)

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substituting the values:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
                 = (8/81) / (2/81)
                 = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4}

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are X) than from Deck B.
