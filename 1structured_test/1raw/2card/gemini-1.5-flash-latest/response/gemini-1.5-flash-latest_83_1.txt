Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.  We can calculate this using the binomial probability formula:
   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                   = (8/27) / (8/81)
                   = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 3:1 means that it's three times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
