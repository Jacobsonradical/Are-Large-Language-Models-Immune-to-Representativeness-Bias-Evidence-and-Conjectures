Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was equally likely to be chosen)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck)**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we've found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]

Simplify:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.  This means that the evidence (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) makes it four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
