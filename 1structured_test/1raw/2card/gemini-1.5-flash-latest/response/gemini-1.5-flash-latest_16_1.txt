Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck was selected at random).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the data:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]** 

Substitute the values:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]** 

Simplify:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32 / 8 = 4**

**Answer:** 

{odds: 4} 

This means that the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from the deck with more X's.
