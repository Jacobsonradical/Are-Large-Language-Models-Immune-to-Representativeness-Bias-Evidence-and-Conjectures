Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(E|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution: 
    *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(E|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

This gives us the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the evidence (E).

**5. Calculation**

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) / (8/81)
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

This means the posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.
