Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck):**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A compared to B given the data D are:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
                = (8/81) / (2/81)
                = 4
```

**Answer:** {odds: 4}
