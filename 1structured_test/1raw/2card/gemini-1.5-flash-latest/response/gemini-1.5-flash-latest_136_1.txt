Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **E:** The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was chosen at random)

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(E|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck A was selected.
    * This is a binomial probability:  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(E|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that Deck B was selected.
    * Again, a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of Deck A being selected given the observed event E is:

```
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

Plugging in the values:

```
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3
```

**Answer:**
{odds: 3}
