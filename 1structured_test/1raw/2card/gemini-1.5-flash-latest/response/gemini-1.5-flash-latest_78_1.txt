Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen randomly)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data:

Posterior Odds = P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Notice that P(D) is the same in both equations, so it cancels out when we take the ratio:

Posterior Odds = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Posterior Odds = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
