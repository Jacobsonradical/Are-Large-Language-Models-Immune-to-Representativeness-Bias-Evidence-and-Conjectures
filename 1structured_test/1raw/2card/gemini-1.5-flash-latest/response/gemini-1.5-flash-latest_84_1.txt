Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Bayes' Theorem states:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Since we are looking for the ratio, the P(D) term cancels out:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
