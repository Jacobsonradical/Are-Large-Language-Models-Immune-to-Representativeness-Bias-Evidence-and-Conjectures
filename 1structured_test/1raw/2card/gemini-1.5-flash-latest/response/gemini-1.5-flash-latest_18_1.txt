Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let "E" be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was selected with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(E|A): The probability of getting 3 X and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This is a binomial probability: 
    * (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(E|B): The probability of getting 3 X and 1 O given Deck B was selected:
    * (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the evidence E:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E)

Bayes' Theorem states:

* P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)
* P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E)

Notice that P(E) is the same in both equations.  Therefore, when we take the ratio, P(E) cancels out:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

This means the posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the cards.  The evidence makes it three times more likely that the cards came from Deck A.
