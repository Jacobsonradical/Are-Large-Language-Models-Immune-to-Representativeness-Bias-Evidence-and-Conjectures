Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
* **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
* **D:** The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given each deck:

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A.  This is a binomial probability calculation:
    * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we've calculated:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/54) / (8/162)
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it is 3 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more Xs) than from Deck B (the deck with more Os), given the observed data.
