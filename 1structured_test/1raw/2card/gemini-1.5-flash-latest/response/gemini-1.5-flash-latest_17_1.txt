Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **E:**  The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck was selected at random).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(E|A):** Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This is calculated using the binomial distribution: 
   * P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(E|B):** Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   * P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* **P(A|E) / P(B|E)**

Bayes' Theorem gives us:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate:**

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) / (8/81)
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it's three times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
