Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
*  Let B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
