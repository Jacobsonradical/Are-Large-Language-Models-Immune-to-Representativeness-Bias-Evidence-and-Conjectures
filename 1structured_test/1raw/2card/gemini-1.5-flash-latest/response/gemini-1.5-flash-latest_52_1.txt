Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods (Probabilities of the data given each deck):**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)  = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A versus B, given the data D, are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D)  =  [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
*  = (8/81) / (2/81)
* = 4 

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X's, than from Deck B.
