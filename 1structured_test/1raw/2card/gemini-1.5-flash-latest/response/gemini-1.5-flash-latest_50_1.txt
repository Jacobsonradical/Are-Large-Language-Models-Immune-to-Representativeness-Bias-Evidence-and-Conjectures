Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "A" be the event that deck A was chosen.
*  Let "B" be the event that deck B was chosen.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was equally likely to be chosen).
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A): This is the probability of getting 3 X and 1 O if deck A was chosen. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(D|B): This is the probability of getting 3 X and 1 O if deck B was chosen.
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the deck based on the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 / 8/81 = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**  The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of deck A. This means that after observing the drawn cards, it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from deck A (where most cards are marked X) than from deck B.
