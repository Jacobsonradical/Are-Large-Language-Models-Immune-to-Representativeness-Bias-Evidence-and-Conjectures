Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of observing the data given each deck):**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means that the odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A are 4 times higher than the odds of them being drawn from Deck B, given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O.
