Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let 'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the evidence given each deck)**

*  P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A versus B given the evidence E is:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
