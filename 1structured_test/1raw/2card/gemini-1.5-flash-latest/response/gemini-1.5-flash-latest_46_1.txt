Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

*  P(A) = 1/2
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

The likelihoods are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck:

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we have:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
                = (8/81) / (2/81)
                = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means it is 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X's, than from Deck B.
