Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probabilities of the data given each deck):**

*  P(D | A): This is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. 
    * We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D | B): This is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

*  Substitute the values we calculated:

   P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:** {odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 3:1 indicate that it's three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B.
