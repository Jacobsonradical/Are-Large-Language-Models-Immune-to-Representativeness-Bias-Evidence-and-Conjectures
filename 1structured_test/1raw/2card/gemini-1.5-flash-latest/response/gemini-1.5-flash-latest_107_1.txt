Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are equal:

*  P(A) = 1/2
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given deck A.  This is a binomial probability:
    * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given deck B.
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our beliefs based on new evidence:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 4:1 mean that it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from deck B.
