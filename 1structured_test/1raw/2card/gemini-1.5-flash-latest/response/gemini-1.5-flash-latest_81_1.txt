Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem lets us calculate the posterior odds:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

Plugging in the values:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                  = (8/27) / (8/81) 
                  = 3
```

**Answer:** {odds: 3}
