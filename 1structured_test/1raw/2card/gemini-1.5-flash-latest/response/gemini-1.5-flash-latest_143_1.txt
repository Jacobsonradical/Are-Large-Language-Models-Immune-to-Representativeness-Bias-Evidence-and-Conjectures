Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D | A) - The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability calculation: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(D | B) - The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was chosen: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A compared to B, given the data D, is:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

[ (32/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (8/81) * (1/2) ] = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
