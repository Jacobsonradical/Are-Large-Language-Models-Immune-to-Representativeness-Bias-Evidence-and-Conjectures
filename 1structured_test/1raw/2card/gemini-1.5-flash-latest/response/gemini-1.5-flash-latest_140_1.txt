Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck B was chosen.
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Bayes' Theorem states:

*  P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
*  P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Since we are interested in the ratio, we can ignore the P(D) term in the denominator:

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/54) / (8/162) 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of deck A being the source of the cards. This means that it is three times more likely that the cards were drawn from deck A than from deck B, given the observation of 3 X's and 1 O.
