Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) 

Using Bayes' Theorem:

[P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate:**

Substitute the values we found:

[(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
