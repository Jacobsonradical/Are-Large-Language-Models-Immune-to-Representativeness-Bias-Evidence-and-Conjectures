Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
* Let B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
* Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (since the deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹  = 8/81  (probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).  Bayes' Theorem tells us:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Notice that P(D) appears in both equations, and we can cancel it out when calculating the ratio:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(P(D|A) * P(A)) / P(D)] / [(P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D)]
                 = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
                 = (8/81) / (2/81)
                 = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.  In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given that we observed 3 X's and 1 O.
