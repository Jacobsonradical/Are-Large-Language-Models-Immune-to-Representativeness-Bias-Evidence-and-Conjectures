Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'A' be the event that the deck chosen is Deck A.
*  Let 'B' be the event that the deck chosen is Deck B.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A versus B given the data D is:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
