Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  `P(A) = 1/2` (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  `P(B) = 1/2`

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of data given the deck):**

* `P(D|A)`:  The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A. This is calculated using the binomial distribution: 
    *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/27
* `P(D|B)`: The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which are the ratio of the posterior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B given the data:

`P(A|D) / P(B|D)` 

Bayes' Theorem states:

`P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]`

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values we calculated:

`[(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3`

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. This means it is 3 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck with more X cards, given the observed data.
