Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, we have:
* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 Xs and 1 O) given each deck:

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81   (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probabilities:

* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

To find the posterior odds, we take the ratio of these two probabilities:

* Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Plugging in the values:

* Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4/1 

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

This means that the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, the deck with more Xs.
