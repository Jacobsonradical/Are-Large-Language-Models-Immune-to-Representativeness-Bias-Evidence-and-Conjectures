Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

*  P(A) = 1/2
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X, 1 O) given each deck:

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (3 X cards from A, 1 O card from A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (3 X cards from B, 1 O card from B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Plugging in the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 indicate that it is four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
