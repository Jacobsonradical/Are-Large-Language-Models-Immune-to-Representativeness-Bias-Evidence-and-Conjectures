Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was chosen at random)

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck)**

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A. We can use the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27 
* **P(D|B):** The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A versus B given the data D are:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D)  =  [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3
```

**Answer:** {odds: 3}

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it's three times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B (the deck with more O's), given the observed data.
