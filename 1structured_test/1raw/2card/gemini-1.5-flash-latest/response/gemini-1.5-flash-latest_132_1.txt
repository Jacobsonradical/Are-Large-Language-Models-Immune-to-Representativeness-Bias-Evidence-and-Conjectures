Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This is a binomial probability calculation:  
   *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data (D):

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D)** 

Bayes' Theorem gives us:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values we calculated:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 / 8/8 = 4**

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4}
