Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  Event that Deck A was selected.
* **B:** Event that Deck B was selected.
* **D:** Event that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 1/2** (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability).
* **P(B) = 1/2**

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck):**

* **P(D|A):** This is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. We can use the binomial distribution: 
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):**  This is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem lets us calculate the posterior odds:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]** 

Substituting the values we calculated:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it is 3 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where X's are more common) than from Deck B.
