Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  'A' be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
*  Let 'B' be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen randomly)

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(E|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(E|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B, given the evidence (E), is:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substituting the values:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
