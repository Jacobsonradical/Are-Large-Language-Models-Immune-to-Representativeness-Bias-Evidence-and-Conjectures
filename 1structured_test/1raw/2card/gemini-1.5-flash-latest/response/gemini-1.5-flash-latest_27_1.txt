Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 X cards, 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A):  The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D|B): The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck B was chosen.
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D)  = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 3:1 indicate that it's three times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B. The observation of 3 X cards and 1 O card has increased our belief that the cards came from the deck with a higher probability of drawing X cards.
