Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  `A` be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  Since the deck was selected at random, `P(A) = P(B) = 1/2`.

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  `P(D|A)`: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This is a binomial probability: 
    *  `P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27`
*  `P(D|B)`: Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected:
    *  `P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81`

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probabilities:

* `P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]`
* `P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]`

**5. Posterior Odds:**

The posterior odds of A versus B are given by:

* `Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]`

Plugging in the values:

* `Odds(A|D) / Odds(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3`

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
