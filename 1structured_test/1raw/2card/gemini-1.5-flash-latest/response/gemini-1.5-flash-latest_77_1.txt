Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was selected at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(D|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck A was chosen. 
    * This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck B was chosen.
    * This is also a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A versus B, given the data D, are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values:

[ (32/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (8/81) * (1/2) ] = 32/8  = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
