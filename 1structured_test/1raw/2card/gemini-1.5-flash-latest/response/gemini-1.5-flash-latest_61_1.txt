Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen randomly)

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of Data Given Each Deck):**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81   (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means that the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the cards. In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than Deck B.
