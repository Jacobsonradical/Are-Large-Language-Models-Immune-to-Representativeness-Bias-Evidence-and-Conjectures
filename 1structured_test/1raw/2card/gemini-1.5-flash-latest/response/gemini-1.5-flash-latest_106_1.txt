Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the Data Given Each Deck):**

*  P(D|A): Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A.
    * This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(D|B): Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B.
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.  In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A, given the observed data.
