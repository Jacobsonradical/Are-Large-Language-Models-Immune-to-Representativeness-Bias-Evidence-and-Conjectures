Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D | A):  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected.  This is calculated using the binomial distribution:
     (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D | B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
     (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the selected deck based on the observed data:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we've calculated:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]

Simplify:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the cards. This means that the observed data (3 X's and 1 O) makes it 3 times more likely that Deck A was selected compared to Deck B.
