Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:**  The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):**  Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability:
   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D)  =  [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8

**6. Answer:**

The posterior odds of Deck A being selected, given the observed draw, are 32/8 = **4**. 

**Therefore, {odds: 4}**
