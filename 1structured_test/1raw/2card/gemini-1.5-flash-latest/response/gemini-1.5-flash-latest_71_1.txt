Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event that 3 Xs and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was selected with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem states: 

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from deck A.  In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from the deck with more Xs.
