Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

The likelihoods are the probabilities of observing the data (D) given each deck:

* P(D|A): Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.  This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* P(D|B): Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.  Similarly, (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we've calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 4:1 mean that it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B.
