Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was selected by chance).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D | A):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card *given* Deck A was selected. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D | B):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card *given* Deck B was selected:
    *  P(D | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data (D):

* **P(A | D) / P(B | D)**

Bayes' Theorem states:

* P(A | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B | D) = [P(D | B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Since P(D) is the same in both equations, it cancels out when we take the ratio:

* **P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]**

**5. Calculate the Odds:**

*  P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = **3**

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
