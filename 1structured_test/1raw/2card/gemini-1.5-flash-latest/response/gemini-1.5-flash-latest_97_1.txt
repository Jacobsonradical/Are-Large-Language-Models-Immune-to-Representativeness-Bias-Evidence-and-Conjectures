Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck was selected at random)

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data:

**P(A|D) / P(B|D)**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
