Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that the chosen deck is Deck A.
*  Let "B" be the event that the chosen deck is Deck B.
*  Let "E" be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

The likelihoods are the probabilities of observing the evidence (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck:

* P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probabilities (the probability of each deck given the evidence):

* P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)
* P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E)

Where P(E) is the total probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O, calculated using the law of total probability:

* P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2) = 5/81

**5. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds are the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/81) * (1/2) / (5/81)] / [(2/81) * (1/2) / (5/81)] = (8/5) / (2/5) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
