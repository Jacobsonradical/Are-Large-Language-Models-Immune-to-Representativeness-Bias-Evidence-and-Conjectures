Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The event that Deck A was selected.
*  **B:** The event that Deck B was selected.
*  **D:** The event that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck was chosen randomly).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution: 
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck after observing the data:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3**

**Answer:**
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that the data makes it 3 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (where X's are more common) than from Deck B.
