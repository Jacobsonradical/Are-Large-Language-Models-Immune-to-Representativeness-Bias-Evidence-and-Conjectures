Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(E|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability:
    *  P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(E|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    *  P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B are:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate:**

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                 = (32/81) / (8/81)
                 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
