Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  'A' be the event that deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(E|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck A was chosen. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27 
* P(E|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck B was chosen:
    * P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) / (8/81) 
*  P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

This means the posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A.  In other words, it's three times more likely that the cards came from the deck with more X's.
