Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **E:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:
*  P(A) = 1/2 
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(E|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A. This is a binomial probability:
   * P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(E|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   * P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
               = (8/27) / (8/81)
               = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
