Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probabilities of data given each deck):**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  = 8/81  (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is P(A|D) / P(B|D).  Bayes' Theorem gives us:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values:

[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
