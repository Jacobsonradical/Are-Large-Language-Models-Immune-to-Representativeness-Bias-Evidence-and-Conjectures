Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let `A` be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let `E` be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* Since the deck was selected by chance, `P(A) = P(B) = 1/2`.

**3. Likelihoods:**

* `P(E|A)`: Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O given Deck A.  This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* `P(E|B)`: Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O given Deck B: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:
```
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values we've found:

```
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
             = (8/27) / (8/81)
             = 3
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that it's three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
