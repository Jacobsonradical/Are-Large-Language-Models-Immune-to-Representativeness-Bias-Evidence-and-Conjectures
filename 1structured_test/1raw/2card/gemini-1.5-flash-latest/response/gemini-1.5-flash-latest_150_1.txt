Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **E:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since a deck was chosen at random)

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(E|A):** Probability of observing 3 X and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability calculation:
   *  P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(E|B):** Probability of observing 3 X and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   * P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* **P(A|E) / P(B|E)**

Using Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
