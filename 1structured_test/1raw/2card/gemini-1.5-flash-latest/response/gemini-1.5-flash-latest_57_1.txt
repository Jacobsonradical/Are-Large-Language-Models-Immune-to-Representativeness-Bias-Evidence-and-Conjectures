Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'A' be the event that deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of data given each deck):**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

* Substitute the values we calculated:

   P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4}
