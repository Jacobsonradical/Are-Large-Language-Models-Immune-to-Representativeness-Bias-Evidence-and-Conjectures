Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  Since the deck was chosen at random,  P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

To find the posterior odds, we use Bayes' Theorem:

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. This means it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (the deck with more Xs) given the observed outcome of 3 Xs and 1 O.
