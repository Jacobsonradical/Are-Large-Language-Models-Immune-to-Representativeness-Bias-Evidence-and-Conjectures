Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability).
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. We can use the binomial distribution:
   * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* Simplify:  (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**
{odds: 3} 

This means the odds are 3 to 1 in favor of the cards having been drawn from Deck A.
