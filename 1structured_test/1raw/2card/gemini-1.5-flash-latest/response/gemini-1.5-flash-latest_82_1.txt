Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* Let 'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
* Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
* Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was selected at random, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  = 8/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substituting the values:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A being the selected deck. This means that it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (where most cards are X) than from Deck B (where most cards are O), given the observed data.
