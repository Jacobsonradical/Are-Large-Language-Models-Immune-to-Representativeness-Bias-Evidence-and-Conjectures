Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** Deck A was chosen.
*  **B:** Deck B was chosen.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O) was drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since a deck was chosen at random, we have:
* P(A) = 1/2 
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We use the binomial distribution:
    * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck given the observed data:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values we found:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8  = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 mean that it is four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B. The observed data has strengthened our belief that Deck A was the chosen deck.
