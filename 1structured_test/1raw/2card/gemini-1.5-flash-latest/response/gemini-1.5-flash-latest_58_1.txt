Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O) is drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was selected at random, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

The likelihoods are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.  This follows a binomial distribution:
    * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):**  The probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B:
    * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs based on new evidence:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we found:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that the observed data (3 X's and 1 O) makes it four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.
