Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2 
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the evidence (3 X, 1 O) given each deck:

* P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Let's plug in the values:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
                  = (8/81) / (2/81)
                  = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 mean that it is 4 times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
