Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from deck A.
*  Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from deck B.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substituting the values we calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
                 = (8/81) / (2/81)
                 = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from deck A.
