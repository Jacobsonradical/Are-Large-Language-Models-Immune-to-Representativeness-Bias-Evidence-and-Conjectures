Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  "A" be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D | A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of this draw given Deck A)
*  P(D | B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (Probability of this draw given Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the deck based on the observed draw:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A. In other words, it's 4 times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed draw.
