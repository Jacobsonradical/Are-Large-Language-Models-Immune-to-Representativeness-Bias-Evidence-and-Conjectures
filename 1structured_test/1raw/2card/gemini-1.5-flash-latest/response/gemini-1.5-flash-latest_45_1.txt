Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X cards and 1 O card were drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

We need to calculate the probability of observing the data (3 X, 1 O) given each deck:

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from Deck A. This follows a binomial distribution:
   * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from Deck B:
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs based on new evidence:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we've found:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8 
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that after observing the data, we are 4 times more likely to believe that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) than from Deck B.
