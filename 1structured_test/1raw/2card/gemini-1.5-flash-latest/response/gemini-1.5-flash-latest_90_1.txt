Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 1/2:**  Since the deck was chosen randomly, there's a 50/50 chance of selecting either Deck A or Deck B.
* **P(B) = 1/2:** Same reasoning as above.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected.  We need to calculate this using the binomial distribution.  
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B given the observed data (D) is:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3
```

**Answer:** 
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it's three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than Deck B.
