Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:**  The observed data (3 X's and 1 O)

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 1/2:**  Since the deck was chosen at random, there's an equal chance of selecting either deck.
* **P(B) = 1/2:**  Same reasoning as above.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D | A):**  The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given the deck is A. This is calculated using the binomial distribution:  
    *  P(D | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81 
* **P(D | B):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given the deck is B.
    *  P(D | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:  
P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we calculated:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 

Simplify:  P(A | D) / P(B | D) = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A are 4 to 1. This means that it is four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B.
