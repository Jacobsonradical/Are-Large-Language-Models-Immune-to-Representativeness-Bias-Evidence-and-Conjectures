Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'A' be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
*  Let 'B' be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck):**

*  P(D|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.  
    *  This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D|B):  The probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B. 
    *  This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A versus B given the data are:

```
[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

Substituting the values:

```
[P(A|D) / P(B|D)] = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                  = (8/27) / (8/81)
                  = 3 
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
