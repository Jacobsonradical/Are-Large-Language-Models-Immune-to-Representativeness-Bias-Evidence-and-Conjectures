Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that deck A was chosen.
* Let B be the event that deck B was chosen.
* Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of data given each deck)**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substituting the values we calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4/1

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 
 
This means the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of deck A. In other words, it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from deck A (the deck with more X's) than from deck B.
