Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let 'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was selected at random, the prior probabilities are:
* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we have:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the cards. This means that the evidence (drawing 3 Xs and 1 O) makes it four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A, where the majority of cards are marked X.
