Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  "A" be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let "E" be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(E|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(E|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of getting 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of A compared to B, given the evidence (E), are:

```
P(A|E) / P(B|E)  =  [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ]  =  8 / 2 = 4
```

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
