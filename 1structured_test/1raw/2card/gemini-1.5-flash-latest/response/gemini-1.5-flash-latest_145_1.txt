Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
*  Let B be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A compared to B given the data D are:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

```
[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
