Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The event that Deck A was chosen.
* **B:** The event that Deck B was chosen.
* **D:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 1/2:**  Since one deck was chosen at random, the probability of choosing either deck is equal.
* **P(B) = 1/2**

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card given that Deck A was chosen. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution: 
   * P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O card given that Deck B was chosen:
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

* Substitute the values we calculated:
   * P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
   * P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8 
   * P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4} 

This means that the posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of the cards having been drawn from Deck A.  In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed outcome.
