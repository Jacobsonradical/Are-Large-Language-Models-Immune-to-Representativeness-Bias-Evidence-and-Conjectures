Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was chosen by chance, the prior probabilities are:

*  P(A) = 1/2 
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

The likelihoods are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's and 1 O) given each deck:

*  P(D | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck after observing the data:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we calculated:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8 / 2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
