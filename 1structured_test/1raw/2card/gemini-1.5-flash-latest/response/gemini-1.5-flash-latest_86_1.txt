Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* Since the deck was chosen by chance, `P(A) = P(B) = 1/2`.

**3. Likelihoods**

*  `P(D|A)`: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  This is a binomial probability:  
   ```
   P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27 
   ```
* `P(D|B)`: The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   ```
   P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81
   ```

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs based on new evidence:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we've calculated:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
             = (8/27) / (8/81)
             = 3
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A.  This means that after observing the drawn cards, it's three times more likely that the cards came from Deck A (where X's are more common) than from Deck B.
