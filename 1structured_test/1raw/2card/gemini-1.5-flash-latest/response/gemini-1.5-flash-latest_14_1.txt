Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
*  Let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Notice that P(D) is the same in both equations.  Therefore, the posterior odds are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
