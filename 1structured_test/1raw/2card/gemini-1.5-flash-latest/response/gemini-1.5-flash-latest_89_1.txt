Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution: 
   (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27 
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) 

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

[ (8/27) * (1/2) ] / [ (8/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
