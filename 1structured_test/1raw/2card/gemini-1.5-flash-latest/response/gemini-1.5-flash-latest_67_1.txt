Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 X cards, 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck was selected at random, we have equal prior probabilities:
* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D | A):**  The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck A was selected. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D | B):**  The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that Deck B was selected.
    * P(D | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Plugging in the values:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8

**6. Posterior Odds:**

The posterior odds of Deck A being selected compared to Deck B are **4 to 1**. 

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4}
