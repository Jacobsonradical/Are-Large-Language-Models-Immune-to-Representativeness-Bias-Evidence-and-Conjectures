Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) 

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
