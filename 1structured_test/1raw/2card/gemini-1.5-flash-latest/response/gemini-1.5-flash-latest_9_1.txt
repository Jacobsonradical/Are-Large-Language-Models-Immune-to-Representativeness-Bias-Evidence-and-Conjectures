Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was chosen randomly)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.  This is a binomial probability:
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
   *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D)**

Bayes' Theorem states:

* **P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)**
* **P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)**

Since P(A) = P(B) and P(D) is the same in both cases, we can simplify the ratio:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]  = P(D|A) / P(D|B)**

**5. Calculate the Posterior Odds:**

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (32/81) / (8/81) = 4**

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4} 

This means the odds are 4:1 that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X cards) compared to Deck B.
