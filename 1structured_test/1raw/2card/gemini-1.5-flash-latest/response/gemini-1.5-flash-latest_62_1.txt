Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the chosen deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck given the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate the Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values we calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = 32/8 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}

This means that the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A are 4 times higher than the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck B, given the observed data.
