Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random).
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values we have:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
