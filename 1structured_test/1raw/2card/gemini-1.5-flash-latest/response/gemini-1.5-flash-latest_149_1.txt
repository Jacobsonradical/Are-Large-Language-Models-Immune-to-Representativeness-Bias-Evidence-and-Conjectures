Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability calculation: 
   (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* P(D|B): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                  = (32/81) / (8/81)
                  = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
