Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was chosen by chance, we have:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 Xs and 1 O) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (3 Xs from the 2/3 X cards, 1 O from the 1/3 O cards)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81   (3 Xs from the 1/3 X cards, 1 O from the 2/3 O cards)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/162) / (2/162)
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, given the observed data.
