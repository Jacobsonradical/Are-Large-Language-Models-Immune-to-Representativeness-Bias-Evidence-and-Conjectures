Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **E:** The event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 1/2:**  Since the deck was selected at random, there's a 50/50 chance it was either A or B.
* **P(B) = 1/2:** Same as above.

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of evidence given each deck)**

* **P(E|A):** Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
   *  P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/27
* **P(E|B):** Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
   *  P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
              = (8/27) / (8/81)
              = 3

**Answer:** {odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that it is three times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed outcome of 3 X cards and 1 O card.
