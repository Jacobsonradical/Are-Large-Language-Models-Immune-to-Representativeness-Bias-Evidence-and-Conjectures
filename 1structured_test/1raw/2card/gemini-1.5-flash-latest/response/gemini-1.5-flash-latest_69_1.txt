Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The event that deck A was selected.
*  **B:**  The event that deck B was selected.
*  **D:**  The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

Since the deck was selected at random, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that deck A was selected. This is a binomial probability:  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given that deck B was selected: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the selected deck after observing the data:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values:

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
