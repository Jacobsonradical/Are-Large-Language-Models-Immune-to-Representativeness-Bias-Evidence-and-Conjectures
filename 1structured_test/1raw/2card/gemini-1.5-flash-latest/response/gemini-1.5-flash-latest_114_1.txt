Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  "A" be the event that deck A was chosen.
*  Let "B" be the event that deck B was chosen.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2 (50% chance of choosing deck A)
* P(B) = 1/2 (50% chance of choosing deck B)

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 Xs and 1 O) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (probability of drawing this combination from deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (probability of drawing this combination from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our belief about the chosen deck given the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substituting the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 indicate that it is 4 times more likely that the cards were drawn from deck A (the deck with more Xs) than from deck B (the deck with more Os), given the observed data.
