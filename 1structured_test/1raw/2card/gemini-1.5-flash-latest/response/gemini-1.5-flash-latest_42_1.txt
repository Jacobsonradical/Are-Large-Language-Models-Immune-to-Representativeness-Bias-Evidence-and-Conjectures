Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "A" be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen randomly)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. This is calculated using the binomial distribution: 
    *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
    * (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of A and B given the data D:

P(A|D) / P(B|D)  

Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substituting the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                  = (8/27) / (8/81)
                  = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
