Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of Deck A being selected (given the observed data) are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substituting the values:

[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
