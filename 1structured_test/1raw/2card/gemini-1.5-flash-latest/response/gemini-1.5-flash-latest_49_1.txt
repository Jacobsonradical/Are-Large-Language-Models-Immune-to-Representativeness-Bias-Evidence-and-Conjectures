Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
*  **D:** The observed data (3 Xs and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2  (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A): Probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. 
    *  This is a binomial probability:  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D|B): Probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A compared to B, given the data D, are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

[ (8/27) * (1/2) ] / [ (8/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
