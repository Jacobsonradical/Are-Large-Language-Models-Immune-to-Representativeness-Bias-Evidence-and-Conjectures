Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D | A): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
     P(D | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D | B): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
     P(D | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 

Simplify:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 3:1. This means it's three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B.
