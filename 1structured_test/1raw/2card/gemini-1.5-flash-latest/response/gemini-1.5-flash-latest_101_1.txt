Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let `A` be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  Since the deck is chosen at random,  P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A):  The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/27
*  P(D|B):  The probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
              = (8/27) / (8/81) 
              = 3
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
