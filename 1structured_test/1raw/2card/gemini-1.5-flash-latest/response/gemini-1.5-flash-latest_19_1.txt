Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
