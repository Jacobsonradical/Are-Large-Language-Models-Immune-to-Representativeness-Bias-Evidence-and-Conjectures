Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  `A` be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let `B` be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let `D` be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  Since the deck was selected by chance, `P(A) = P(B) = 1/2`.

**3. Likelihoods**

*  `P(D|A)`: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability calculation: 
     *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  `P(D|B)`: The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
     *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D) 
```

Where `P(D)` is the total probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)
     = (8/27) * (1/2) + (8/81) * (1/2)
     = 40/162
```

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds of Deck A being chosen are:

```
P(A|D) / P(B|D) 
```

We can calculate this using Bayes' Theorem and the values we've found:

```
[P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)  /  [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)
= P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D|B) * P(B)
= (8/27) * (1/2) / (8/81) * (1/2)
= 3
```

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
