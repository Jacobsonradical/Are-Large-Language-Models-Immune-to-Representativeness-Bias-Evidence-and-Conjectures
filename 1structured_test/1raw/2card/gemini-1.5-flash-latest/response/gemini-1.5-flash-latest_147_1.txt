Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:**  The chosen deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The chosen deck is Deck B.
*  **D:**  The observed data (3 Xs and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  Since the deck was chosen at random.

**3. Likelihoods**

*  **P(D|A):**  The probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  **P(D|B):**  The probability of observing 3 Xs and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the deck based on the observed data:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]** 

**5. Calculation**

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3**

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. This means that after observing the data, it is three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A than from Deck B.
