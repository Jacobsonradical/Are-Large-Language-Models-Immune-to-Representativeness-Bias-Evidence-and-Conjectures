Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X cards, 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck is chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O card given that Deck A was chosen.  This is a binomial probability calculation: 
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O card given that Deck B was chosen.
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B are:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

Substituting the values:

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3**

**Answer:** 
{odds: 3}
