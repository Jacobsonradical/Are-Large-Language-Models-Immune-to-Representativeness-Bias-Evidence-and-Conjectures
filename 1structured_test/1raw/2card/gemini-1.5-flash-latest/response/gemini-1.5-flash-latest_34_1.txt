Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen randomly)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(D|A): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A. This is a binomial probability:  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* P(D|B): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the selected deck given the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
             = (8/27) / (8/81)
             = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 3:1 indicate that it is 3 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B. The observed data has strengthened our belief that Deck A was the source of the cards.
