Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** Event that deck A was selected.
*  **B:** Event that deck B was selected.
*  **D:** Event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was selected randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D|A): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck A was selected. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
    *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
*  P(D|B): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given deck B was selected.
    *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds: P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Bayes' Theorem states:
* P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)
* P(B|D) = [P(D|B) * P(B)] / P(D)

Therefore, the posterior odds are:

[P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] = [ (32/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (8/81) * (1/2) ] = 32/8 / 8/8 = 4

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4}
