Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen randomly)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81   (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]
* P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 4 

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
