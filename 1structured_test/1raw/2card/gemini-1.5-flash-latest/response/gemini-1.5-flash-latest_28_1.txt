Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  Since the deck was selected randomly.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O card given Deck A was chosen.
   * We need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from a deck where 2/3 are X. This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O card given Deck B was chosen.
   * Similar to above, but using the probabilities from Deck B: (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

Let's plug in the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]

**5. Simplify**

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = 32/8  = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

This means that the posterior odds are 4 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A. In other words, it's four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B, given the observed data.
