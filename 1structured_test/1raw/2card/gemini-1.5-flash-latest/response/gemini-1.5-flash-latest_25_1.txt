Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'E' be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was equally likely to be chosen)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of observing the data given each deck)**

*  P(E|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(E|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

* Substitute the values:
   P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)]

* Simplify:
   P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 8 / 2 = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A.  This means it's four times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more Xs) than from Deck B.
