Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **E:** The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck is chosen randomly, the prior probabilities are equal:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the evidence (3 Xs and 1 O) given each deck:

* **P(E|A):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A.  We can use the binomial distribution:
    * P(E|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 32/81
* **P(E|B):** The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
    * P(E|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the deck given the evidence:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we found:

* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = [(32/81) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 32/8 
* P(A|E) / P(B|E) = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:**

The posterior odds of 4:1 mean that it's four times more likely that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more Xs) than from Deck B.
