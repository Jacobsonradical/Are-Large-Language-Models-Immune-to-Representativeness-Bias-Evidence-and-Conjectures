Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X cards, 1 O card).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck is chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** Probability of observing the data given Deck A was chosen. This is calculated using the binomial distribution: 
   *  (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27 
* **P(D|B):** Probability of observing the data given Deck B was chosen:
   *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior odds:

**P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]**

**5. Calculation**

* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]**
* **P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3**

**Answer:** 
{odds: 3} 
 
This means the odds are 3 to 1 in favor of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A.
