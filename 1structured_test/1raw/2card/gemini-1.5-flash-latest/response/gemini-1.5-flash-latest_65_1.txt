Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that Deck A was chosen.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was chosen.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

*  P(A) = 1/2 
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3) = 2/81   (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A|D) / P(B|D)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] 
                      = (8/81) / (2/81)
                      = 4

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
