Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let 'A' be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability).
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1  = 8/81 (The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of A vs. B given the data D are:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

[ (8/81) * (1/2) ] / [ (2/81) * (1/2) ] = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4} 

This means the posterior odds are 4 to 1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the drawn cards.
