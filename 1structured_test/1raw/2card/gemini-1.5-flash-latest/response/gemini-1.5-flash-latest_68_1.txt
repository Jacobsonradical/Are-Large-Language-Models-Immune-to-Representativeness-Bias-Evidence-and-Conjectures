Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event that 3 X's and 1 O are drawn.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

Since a deck was chosen at random, the prior probabilities are:

* P(A) = 1/2
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of observing the data (3 X's, 1 O) given each deck:

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we calculated:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4/1

**Answer:**

{odds: 4}
