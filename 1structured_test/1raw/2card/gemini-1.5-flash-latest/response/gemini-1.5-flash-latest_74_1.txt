Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let B be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let D be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since either deck was chosen with equal probability)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probabilities of Data Given Each Deck):**

* P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
* P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds:**

Substituting the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 4

**Answer:** {odds: 4} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 4:1 in favor of Deck A being the source of the 4 cards. This means that the evidence (drawing 3 X's and 1 O) makes it four times more likely that the cards came from Deck A than from Deck B.
