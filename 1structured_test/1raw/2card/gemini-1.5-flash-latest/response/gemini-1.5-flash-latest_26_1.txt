Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:**  The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected randomly)
* P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck):**

* P(D | A): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A.  
   * This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* P(D | B): Probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B.
   * (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior odds of Deck A versus Deck B, given the data, are:

```
P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                   = (8/27) / (8/81)
                   = 3
```

**Answer:**
{odds: 3}
