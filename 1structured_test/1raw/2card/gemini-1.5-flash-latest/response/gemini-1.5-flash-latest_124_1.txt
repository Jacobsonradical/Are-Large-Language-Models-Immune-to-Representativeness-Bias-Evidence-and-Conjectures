Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that Deck A was selected.
*  Let "B" be the event that Deck B was selected.
*  Let "D" be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was selected at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(D|A): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was selected. 
    *  This is a binomial probability: (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
*  P(D|B): The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was selected.
    *  (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the deck based on the observed data:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation**

*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)]
*  P(A|D) / P(B|D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3 

**Answer:** 
{odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds of 3:1 mean that it is 3 times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A (the deck with more X's) than from Deck B.
