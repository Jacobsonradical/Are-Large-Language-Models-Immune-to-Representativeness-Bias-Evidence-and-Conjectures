Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define the Events**

*  Let  'A' be the event that deck A was selected.
*  Let 'B' be the event that deck B was selected.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior probabilities are:

*  P(A) = 1/2 (50% chance of choosing deck A)
*  P(B) = 1/2 (50% chance of choosing deck B)

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of Data Given Deck)**

*  P(D | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck A)
*  P(D | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81 (probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probabilities:

*  P(A | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / P(D)
*  P(B | D) = [P(D | B) * P(B)] / P(D)

**5.  Calculate P(D)**

To get P(D), we use the law of total probability:

* P(D) = P(D | A) * P(A) + P(D | B) * P(B)
* P(D) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (2/81) * (1/2) = 5/81

**6. Calculate Posterior Probabilities**

* P(A | D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / (5/81) = 8/10
* P(B | D) = [(2/81) * (1/2)] / (5/81) = 2/10

**7. Posterior Odds**

The posterior odds of deck A compared to deck B are:

* P(A | D) / P(B | D) = (8/10) / (2/10) = 4

**Answer:** 
{odds: 4}
