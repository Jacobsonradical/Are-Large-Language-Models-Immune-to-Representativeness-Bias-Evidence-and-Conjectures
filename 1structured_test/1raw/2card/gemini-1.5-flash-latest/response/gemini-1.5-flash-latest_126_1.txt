Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The chosen deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The chosen deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The observed data (3 X's and 1 O).

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since a deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(D|A):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen. This is a binomial probability:
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen.
   *  P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

The posterior odds of Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data, is:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)] 

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
