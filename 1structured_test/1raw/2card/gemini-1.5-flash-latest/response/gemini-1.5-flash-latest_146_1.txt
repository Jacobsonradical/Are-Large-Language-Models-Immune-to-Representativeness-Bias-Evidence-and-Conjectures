Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The chosen deck is Deck A.
*  **B:** The chosen deck is Deck B.
*  **D:**  The event of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2**  (Since the deck was chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods (Probability of the data given each deck)**

* **P(D|A):**  The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A. We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
   *  P(D|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)³ * (1/3)¹ = 8/27
* **P(D|B):** The probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck B:
   * P(D|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)³ * (2/3)¹ = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / [P(D|B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculate Posterior Odds**

Substitute the values we found:

P(A|D) / P(B|D) = [(8/27) * (1/2)] / [(8/81) * (1/2)] 
                   = (8/27) / (8/81)
                   = 3

**Answer:** {odds: 3} 

**Interpretation:** The posterior odds are 3:1 in favor of Deck A. This means it's three times more likely that the cards were drawn from Deck A, where most cards are marked X, than from Deck B, where most cards are marked O.
