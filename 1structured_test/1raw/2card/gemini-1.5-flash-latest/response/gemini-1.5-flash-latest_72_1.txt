Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'A' be the event that the deck selected is Deck A.
*  Let 'B' be the event that the deck selected is Deck B.
*  Let 'D' be the event of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 1/2 (Since the deck was chosen at random)
*  P(B) = 1/2 

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(D | A) = (2/3)³ * (1/3)  = 8/81  (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A)
*  P(D | B) = (1/3)³ * (2/3) = 2/81 (Probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / [P(D | B) * P(B)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A | D) / P(B | D) = [(8/81) * (1/2)] / [(2/81) * (1/2)] = 8/2 = 4

**Answer:**
{odds: 4}
