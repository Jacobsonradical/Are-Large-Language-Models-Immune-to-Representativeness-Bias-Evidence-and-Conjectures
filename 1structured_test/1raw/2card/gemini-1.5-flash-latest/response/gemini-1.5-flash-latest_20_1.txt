Here's how to calculate the posterior odds:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The selected deck is Deck A.
* **B:** The selected deck is Deck B.
* **D:** The event of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from the selected deck.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = P(B) = 1/2** (Since the deck is chosen at random).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(D | A):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck A was chosen.  We can calculate this using the binomial distribution:
   *  P(D | A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/27
* **P(D | B):** The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O given Deck B was chosen:
   *  P(D | B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 8/81

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find the posterior odds, which are the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

* **P(A | D) / P(B | D)**

Bayes' Theorem states:

* **P(A | D) = [P(D | A) * P(A)] / P(D)**
* **P(B | D) = [P(D | B) * P(B)] / P(D)**

Since P(A) = P(B) and P(D) is the same in both cases, we can simplify the posterior odds:

* **P(A | D) / P(B | D) = P(D | A) / P(D | B)**

**5. Calculate the Posterior Odds:**

* **P(A | D) / P(B | D) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 3**

**Answer:**

{odds: 3}
