To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - attacker is black
W - witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we know:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possibilities, i.e., the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as black, the attacker is black and the witness mistakenly identifies him as white, the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black, and the attacker is white and the witness correctly identifies him as white.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying race, so P(W|not A) = 0.2. Also, since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W):

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
