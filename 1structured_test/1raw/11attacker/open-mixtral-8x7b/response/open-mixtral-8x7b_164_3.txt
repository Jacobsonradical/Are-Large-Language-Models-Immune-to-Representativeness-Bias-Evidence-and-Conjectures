Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We also know that when the witness is unsure, they guess that the person is black 15/25 (or 60%) of the time, since 15% of the population is black and 15% + 10% (the other races not mentioned) equals 25%.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is black) = P(Witness correctly identifies attacker as black) * P(Attacker is black | Witness identified black) + P(Witness erroneously identifies attacker as black) * P(Attacker is white | Witness identified black)

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we have:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.8 * P(Attacker is black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(Attacker is black))

Solving this equation for P(Attacker is black):

0.6 * P(Attacker is black) = 0.2

P(Attacker is black) = 0.2 / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.3333

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.3333, or approximately 33.33%}
