To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In our case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the information provided, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a black person)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the probability of a witness identifying someone as black given that the person is white, which we'll call P(B|not A). Since the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
= 0.15 * 0.2 + (1 - 0.15) * 0.2
= 0.03 + 0.18
= 0.21

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.21
â‰ˆ 0.138

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.138}
