To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is black, so 85% is not black. We can calculate P(W|A') as well, it's the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% of the time).

Then, we can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
