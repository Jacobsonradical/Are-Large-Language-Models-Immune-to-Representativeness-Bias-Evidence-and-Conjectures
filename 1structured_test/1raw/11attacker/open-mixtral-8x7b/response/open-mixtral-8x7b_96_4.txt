To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black." Let's denote these events A and B, respectively. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the black attacker as white 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of a black person given the city's population)

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probabilities of observing B under both hypotheses:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A), and we need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we need to find P(not A), the probability of the attacker being white. Since P(A) = 0.15, we have:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.19

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.2*0.15 / 0.19 â‰ˆ 0.1579

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.79%. Note that the witness's incorrect identification of the attacker increases our uncertainty, leading to a lower estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
