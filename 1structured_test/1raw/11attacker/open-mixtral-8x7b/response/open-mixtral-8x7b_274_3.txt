Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they're more likely to mistake white people as black or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't adjust our calculation based on the city's racial makeup (85% white, 15% black).
4. Therefore, given the information provided, we can only calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct, which is 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
