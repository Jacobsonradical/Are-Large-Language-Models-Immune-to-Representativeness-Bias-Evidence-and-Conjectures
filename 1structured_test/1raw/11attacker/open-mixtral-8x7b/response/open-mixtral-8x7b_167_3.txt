To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where ¬A denotes the attacker being white)

From the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
