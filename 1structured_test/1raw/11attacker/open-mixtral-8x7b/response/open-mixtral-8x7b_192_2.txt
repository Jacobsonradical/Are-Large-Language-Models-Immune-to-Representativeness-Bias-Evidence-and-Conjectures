To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is black (A), and the attacker is white (A'). Then:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|A') * 0.85

Now let's calculate P(W|A'), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness makes errors with 20% probability, P(W|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.196 + 0.1445 = 0.3405

Finally, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3405 â‰ˆ 0.3524

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.3524}
