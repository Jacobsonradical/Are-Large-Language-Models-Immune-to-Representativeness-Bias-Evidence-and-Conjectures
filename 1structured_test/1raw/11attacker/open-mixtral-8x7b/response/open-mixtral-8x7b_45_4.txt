To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
where A' denotes the complementary event "the attacker is not black" (i.e., the attacker is white), and P(A') = 0.85.

We are also given:
P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
