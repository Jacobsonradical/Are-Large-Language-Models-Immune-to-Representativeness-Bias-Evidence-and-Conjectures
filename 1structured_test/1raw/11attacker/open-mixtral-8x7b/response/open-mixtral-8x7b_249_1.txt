Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. However, the witness who identified the attacker as black is only correct 80% of the time.
3. Therefore, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement, which is a conditional probability.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = [P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / P(witness identifies black)
5. We are given that P(attacker is black) = 0.15, and P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness being correct 80% of the time when the person is actually black).
6. To calculate P(witness identifies black), we need to consider the two possible scenarios: the attacker is either black or white. So, we use the law of total probability:
   P(witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)
7. We already know the first term. For the second term, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is white, we have P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.2. And we know that P(attacker is white) = 0.85.
8. Substituting these values into the equation for P(witness identifies black), we get:
   P(witness identifies black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
9. Now, we can calculate the final probability:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
