To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85% or 0.85). Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, both events are equally likely a priori, and thus P(A) = 0.5 (attacker is black) and P(~A) = 0.5 (attacker is white).

Let T be the event that the witness correctly identified the race. From the information provided, P(T|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time) and P(T|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(A|T), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|T) = P(T|A) * P(A) / (P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|~A) * P(~A))
P(A|T) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5))
P(A|T) ≈ 0.8 or 80%

However, since the witness's identification is not 100% accurate, we should also consider the possibility that the witness identified a white person as black. Let F be the event that the witness identified the race incorrectly:

P(F|~A) = P(F|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(~A|F), the probability that the attacker is white given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(~A|F) = P(F|~A) * P(~A) / (P(F|~A) * P(~A) + P(F|A) * P(A))
P(~A|F) = (0.2 * 0.5) / ((0.2 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5))
P(~A|F) ≈ 0.2 or 20%

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider both P(A|T) and P(~A|F). Given that P(T) ≈ 80% (the witness is more likely to correctly identify the race) and P(F) ≈ 20% (the witness is less likely to incorrectly identify the race), we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as:

P(A) = P(A|T) * P(T) + P(A|F) * P(F)
P(A) ≈ (0.8 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2)
P(A) ≈ 0.64 or 64%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 64%.
