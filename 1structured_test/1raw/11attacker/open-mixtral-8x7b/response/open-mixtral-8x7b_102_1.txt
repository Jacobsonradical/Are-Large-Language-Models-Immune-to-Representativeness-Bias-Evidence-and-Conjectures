To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black (15%)
P(W) = probability of an attacker being white (85%)
P(W|W) = probability of witness correctly identifying a white person (100% - 20% = 80%)
P(B|B) = probability of witness correctly identifying a black person (100% - 20% = 80%)
P(W|B) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white (20%)
P(B|W) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20%)

We want to calculate P(B|A), the probability of an attacker being black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W))

Given the information, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = 1 - P(W|W) = 20%

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):
P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.353

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.353}.
