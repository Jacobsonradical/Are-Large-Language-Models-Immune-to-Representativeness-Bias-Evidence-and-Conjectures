To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black (to be estimated)
P(~B) = probability the attacker is not black (i.e., white) = 1 - P(B)
P(W|B) = probability of correctly identifying a black person as black (80%) = 0.8
P(W|~B) = probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20%) = 0.2
P(B|W) = probability of the attack being committed by a black person given the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8
P(W|~B) = 0.2
P(~B) = 1 - P(B)

To compute P(B|W), we need to find a reasonable value for P(B). We are given the city's population distribution, but this might not directly apply because the victim was randomly attacked. Thus, we can assume the probability of the attacker's race being influenced by the population distribution.

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       â‰ˆ 0.2766

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2766}
