To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population)

We need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.0255
= 0.1455

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1455
â‰ˆ 0.8261

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8261}
