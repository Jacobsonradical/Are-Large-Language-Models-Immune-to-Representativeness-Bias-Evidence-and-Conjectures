To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness mistakenly identifies the race as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.96

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.96}
