To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know that P(A)=0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W|A)=0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we don't directly know the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, P(W). To calculate it, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Also, since 85% of the population is white, we have P(not A)=0.85.

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.3429

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3429}
