Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black (a).
3. A witness identified the attacker as black (b), but their ability to judge a person's race is not perfect; they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
4. To use the witness's information, we need to account for both the city's racial makeup and the witness's error rate.
5. Let's assume that the witness's error rate is equally split between false positives (identifying a white person as black) and false negatives (identifying a black person as white). This means that the witness is incorrect 10% of the time for black people and 10% of the time for white people.
6. Given these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black | witness identified black) * P(witness identified black)

   = [P(witness identified black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness identified black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identified black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

   = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]

   = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)

   = 0.12 / 0.205

   = 0.5857 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.5857,}.
