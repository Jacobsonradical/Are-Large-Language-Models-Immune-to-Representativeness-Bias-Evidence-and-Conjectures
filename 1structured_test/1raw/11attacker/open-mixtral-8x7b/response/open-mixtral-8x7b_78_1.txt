To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black, which is 0.15 according to point b.
P(W) = probability of an attacker being white, which is 0.85 according to point b.
P(W|W) = probability of witness correctly identifying a white person, which is 0.8 according to point a.
P(B|B) = probability of witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 according to point a.
P(W|B) = probability of witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white, which is 0.2 according to point a.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified the attacker as white.

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W))
= (0.2 * 0.15) / ((0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85))
= 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.68)
= 0.03 / 0.71
â‰ˆ 0.0423

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.0423 or 4.23%. However, this is not a reasonable answer given the information we have. It suggests that the witness identification is not useful and the attacker is more likely to be white. This is consistent with the information given and our prior beliefs about the racial distribution in the city. Therefore, we would estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of 15%, which is the prior probability based on the racial distribution in the city.
