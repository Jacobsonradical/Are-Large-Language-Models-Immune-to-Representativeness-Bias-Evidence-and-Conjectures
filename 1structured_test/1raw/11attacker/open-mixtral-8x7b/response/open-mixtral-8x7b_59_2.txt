To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(W) as the prior probability of an attacker being white, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(W|W') as the probability of the witness identifying a white person as white, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|W') as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as white, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(W'|B) as the probability of a black person being identified as something other than black, which is 20% or 0.2.
P(W'|W) as the probability of a white person being identified as something other than white, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W'), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the person as something other than black.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(B|W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) / (P(W'|B) * P(B) + P(W'|W) * P(W))

Now we can calculate P(W'|W) = 1 - P(W|W) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Finally, we can use the formula to calculate P(B|W'):
P(B|W') = (0.2 * 0.15) / ((0.2 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.17) = 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15

So our estimate is {probability: 0.15, or 15%}.
