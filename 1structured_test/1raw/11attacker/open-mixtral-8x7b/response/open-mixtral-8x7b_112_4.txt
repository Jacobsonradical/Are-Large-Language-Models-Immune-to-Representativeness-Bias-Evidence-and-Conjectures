Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say what the probability is that the attacker is black.
4. But given the statistics we do have, one possible estimate might be as follows:
   - Assume the worst-case scenario for the defense, where all of the witness's errors involve mistakenly identifying a white person as black.
   - In this case, if the true population proportions were reflected in the attacker pool, then we would expect 15% of the attackers to be black and 85% to be white.
   - If the witness makes an error, they will always point to a white person as the attacker, but since they only make errors 20% of the time, this means that 20% of the time, the true attacker is actually one of the 15% black attackers.
   - Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, could be as high as 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 or 3%.

However, this is a very rough estimate that assumes the worst-case scenario for the defense. A more accurate estimate would require additional information about the direction of the witness's errors.

So, our answer is: {probability: 0.03, explanation: "This is a rough estimate based on the assumption that all of the witness's errors involve mistakenly identifying a white person as black."}
