To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population).
P(W|B) as the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8 based on the witness's ability.
P(~W|B) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white, which is 20% or 0.2.
P(~B) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(W|~B) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black, and P(~W|~B) is the probability of correctly identifying a white person as white. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, P(W|~B) = P(~W|B) = 0.2 and P(~W|~B) = P(W|B) = 0.8.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
