To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given data, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(~A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
