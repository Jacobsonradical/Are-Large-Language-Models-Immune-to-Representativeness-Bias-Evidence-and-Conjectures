To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event multiplied by the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let's define our event (A) as "The attacker is black." From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

Our evidence (B) is "The witness identified the attacker as black." We know from the problem statement that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness is incorrect and identifies a white person as black. Given that half the population is white, we have P(B|not A) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time for white people).

Now we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not black. Since 15% of the population is black, it follows that 85% is white, so P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability of the evidence. Using the law of total probability, we have P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.145.

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.145 â‰ˆ 0.8276

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.8276, explanation: This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, taking into account the population demographics, the witness's accuracy, and the possibility of the witness making errors}.
