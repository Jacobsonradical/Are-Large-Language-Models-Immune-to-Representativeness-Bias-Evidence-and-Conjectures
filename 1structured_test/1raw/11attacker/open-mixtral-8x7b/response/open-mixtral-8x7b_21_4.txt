Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race.
2. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race under conditions similar to that night.
3. Given a sample of people, half white and half black, the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on this information.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Here, B represents the event that the attacker is black, ~B represents the event that the attacker is not black (white), W represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, and P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which we know is 0.15 from the information provided.

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8 and incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2. So, P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.2817

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2817 or 28.17%.
