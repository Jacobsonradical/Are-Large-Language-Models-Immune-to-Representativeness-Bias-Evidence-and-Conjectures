To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - The event that the attacker is black
W - The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8
2. P(A) = 0.15
3. P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. This is given as the error rate for white people, which is 20%. So, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
