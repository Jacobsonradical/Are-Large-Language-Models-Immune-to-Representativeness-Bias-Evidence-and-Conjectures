To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We have been given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

We need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
