To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which according to point b is 15% or 0.15.

P(B|A) is the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness, which according to point a is 80% or 0.8.

P(B) is the probability that a random attacker is identified as black by the witness. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: a black attacker is identified as black and a white attacker is identified as black. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white), and P(B|not A) is the probability that a white attacker is identified as black, which according to point a is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.29 = 0.333 or 33.3% (rounded to one decimal place) as the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.333}.
