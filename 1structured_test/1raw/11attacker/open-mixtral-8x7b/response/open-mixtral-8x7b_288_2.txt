To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B) and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black as P(W|B). We want to calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

We can now calculate P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we need to consider both the correct identification of black people and the incorrect identification of white people as black:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W') * P(W')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
