To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

From the information given, we know:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives us approximately 0.378 or 37.8% when rounded to two decimal places.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.378}
