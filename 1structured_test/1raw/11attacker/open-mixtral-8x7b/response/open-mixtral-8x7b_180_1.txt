To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information, the total population is 100% divided into 85% white and 15% black. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 as calculated earlier. Since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85. The problem states that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values in the above equation, we get:
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
