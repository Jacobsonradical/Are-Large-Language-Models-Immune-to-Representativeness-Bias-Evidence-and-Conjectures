To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(W|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (white)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, the witness will identify him as black with certainty)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black with a 20% chance)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|W) ≈ 0.467 or 46.7%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 46.7%.
