To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

And we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now we can finally calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
