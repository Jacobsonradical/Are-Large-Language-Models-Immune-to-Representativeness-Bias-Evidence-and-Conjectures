To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as black by A and the event that the attacker is actually black by B.

We are interested in finding P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. So, P(A|B) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying black person as black) and P(A|not B) = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying white person as black).

Also given is that 15% of the population is black, so P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of randomly selecting a black person). Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85 (prior probability of randomly selecting a white person).

Now, we can calculate P(not A) = P(not A|B)P(B) + P(not A|not B)P(not B) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.85 = 0.7425 (probability of not identifying the attacker as black).

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) = (P(A|B)P(B)) / (P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|not B)P(not B)) = (0.8*0.15) / (0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85) = 0.18 / 0.29 = 0.621 (estimated probability that the attacker is black).

Answer: {probability: 0.621}
