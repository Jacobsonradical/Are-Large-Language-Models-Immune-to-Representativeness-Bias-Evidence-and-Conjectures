Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have enough information about whether the witness was consistent in their errors - that is, if they tend to mistake white people for black more often than the other way around.
3. So, to keep things simple, let's assume that their errors are randomly distributed and that a mistake in one direction is as likely as a mistake in the other.
4. Given this assumption, when the witness identifies the attacker as black, there's an 80% chance they're correct (the attacker is actually black) and a 20% chance they're wrong (the attacker is actually white).
5. We can express this as our estimate:

{probability: 0.8}
