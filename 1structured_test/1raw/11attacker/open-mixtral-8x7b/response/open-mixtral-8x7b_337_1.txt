To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8, so P(W|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is either black or white. So, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A).

P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(W and not A) = P(W|not A) * P(not A)
From statement (a), the false positive rate is 0.2, so P(W|not A) = 0.2.
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
So, P(W and not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.345}.
