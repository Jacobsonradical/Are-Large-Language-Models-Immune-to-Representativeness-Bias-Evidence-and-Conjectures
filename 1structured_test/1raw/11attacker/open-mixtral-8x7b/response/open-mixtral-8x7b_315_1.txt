To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black". Let's denote these events as B and W, respectively.

From statement (a), we know that the probability of identifying a person as black given they are black (true positive rate) is 0.8, and the probability of identifying a person as white given they are black (false positive rate) is 0.2. 

From statement (b), we know that the prior probability of a person being black is 0.15.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We can calculate P(W|B) as the true positive rate, 0.8.
And P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both true positives and false positives:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(B|W):
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.41}.
