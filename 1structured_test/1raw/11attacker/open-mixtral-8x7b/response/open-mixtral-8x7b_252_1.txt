To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is black, based on the city's population)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two ways in which event B can occur: either the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as such, or the attacker is not black (i.e., white) but the witness mistakenly identifies them as black. We can express this as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A represents the complement of A (i.e., the attacker being white), and P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

From the information given, we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, so P(B|~A) = 0.2. We also know that ~A represents the complement of A, so P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.12 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.43

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.43.
