To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black,
- P(W|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black,
- P(not A) as the probability that the attacker is not black, and
- P(not W|A) as the probability that the witness does not identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time, and the chance of the attacker being white is 0.85)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A)
- P(not W|A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2
- P(A) is what we want to find

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A))

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use this formula to find P(A|W).

First, we need to find P(not A), which is:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A)

Now, let's rewrite Bayes' theorem in terms of P(A):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* (1 - P(A)) / (P(W|A) \* (1 - P(A)) + P(W|not A) \* P(A))

We have three unknowns: P(A), P(A|W), and P(not A|W). However, we can find P(A|W) if we know the ratio of P(A) and P(not A).

From the problem statement, we know that the city population is 85% white and 15% black. We can infer that the prior probability of an attacker being black is 15%. Therefore, the ratio of P(A) and P(not A) is:

P(A) / P(not A) = 15% / 85% = 0.1765 (approximately)

Given this ratio, we can find the probability that the attacker is black, P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.8 \* (1 - 0.1765) / (0.8 \* (1 - 0.1765) + 0.17 \* 0.1765)

Computing the value of P(A|W), we get:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.3228

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3228}
