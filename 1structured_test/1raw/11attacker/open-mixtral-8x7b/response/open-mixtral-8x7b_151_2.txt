To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). Then, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A').

From the given information, P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability), and P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
