To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given that 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, we are told that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, we are told that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person's race, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is not black is P(not A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2, so P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B), where P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
