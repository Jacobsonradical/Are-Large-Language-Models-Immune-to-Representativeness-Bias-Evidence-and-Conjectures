To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black and P(W|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15 (from part b).

However, we also need to account for the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which we can denote as P(W|W'). Since there's a 20% error rate for identifying white people as black, we have P(W|W') = 0.2. Given that 85% of the population is white, we have P(W') = 0.85.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|W') * P(W'))
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.3061

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the available information, is approximately 0.3061 or 30.61%.
