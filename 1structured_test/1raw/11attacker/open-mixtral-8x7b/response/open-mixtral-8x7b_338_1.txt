To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified him as black. According to Bayes' theorem, this is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This includes both cases where the attacker is actually black and where the attacker is white but the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.

We can calculate P(W) as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

To find P(W|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, we use the information that the witness errs 20% of the time:
P(W|~A) = 0.2

Substituting these values in, we get:
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.3429...

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.343 or 34.3%.
