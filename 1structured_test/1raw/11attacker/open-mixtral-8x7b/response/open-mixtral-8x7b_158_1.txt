To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(W|A) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(W|~A) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. We are given P(W|A) = 1 and P(W|~A) = 0.2.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W), where P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A).

We can calculate P(W) as follows:
P(W) = (1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Then, we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (1 \* 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.46875.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.46875}
