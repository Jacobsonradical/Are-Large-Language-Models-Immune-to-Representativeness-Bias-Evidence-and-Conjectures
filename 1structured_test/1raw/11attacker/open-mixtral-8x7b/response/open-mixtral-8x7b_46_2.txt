To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black as A, and the event of the attacker actually being black as B.

From the given information, we have:
P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when it's black)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

However, we are missing P(A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. To find this probability, we need to consider both cases: correctly identifying a black person and mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Let's denote the event of the person being black as B, and the event of the person being white as W.

Then, P(A) = P(A∩B) + P(A∩W) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W)

We know P(A|B), P(B), and P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85. We just need to find P(A|W), the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, P(A|W) = 0.2.

Now, we can find P(A):
P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute the probability that the attacker is black:
P(B|A) = P(A∩B) / P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) / P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
