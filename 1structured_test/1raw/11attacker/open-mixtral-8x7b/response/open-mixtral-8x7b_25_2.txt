To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possibilities, namely the attacker being either black or white. So, we can write P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A).

We are given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black. Since 85% of the population is white, we have P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Similarly, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645.

Finally, we can find P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535.

Formatted answer: {probability: 0.4535}
