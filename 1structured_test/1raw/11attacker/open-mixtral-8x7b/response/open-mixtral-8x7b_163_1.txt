To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black,
- P(W|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black,
- P(not A) as the probability that the attacker is not black.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(W|A) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
