To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We are given P(B|A) and can calculate P(B|A') as follows:
- P(B|A') = 1 - P(not B|A') = 1 - P(the witness correctly identifies a white person as black)
- Since the witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time, they must identify race incorrectly 20% of the time: P(B|A') = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to 0.41)

The answer is {probability: 0.41}.
