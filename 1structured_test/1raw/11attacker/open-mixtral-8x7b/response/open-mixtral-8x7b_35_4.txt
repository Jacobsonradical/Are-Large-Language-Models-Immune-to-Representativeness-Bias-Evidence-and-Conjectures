To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(W). This event can happen in two ways: correctly identifying a black attacker (event A and W are both true) and incorrectly identifying a white attacker (event A is false, but W is true). Given the information, we have:

P(W) = P(A) \* P(W|A) + P(not A) \* P(W|not A)
P(W) = 0.15 \* 0.80 + 0.85 \* 0.20
P(W) ≈ 0.255

Now we need to find P(A|W), which is the probability we are looking for. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) = 0.15 \* 0.80 / 0.255
P(A|W) ≈ 0.0467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the available information, is approximately 4.67%.
