To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that P(W|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (or 80%). We also know that P(B) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is not given but can be estimated from the information that 15% of the population is black. If we assume that the attackers are selected randomly from the population, then P(B) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider the two possible scenarios: the attacker is black (B), and the attacker is white (~B). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black and incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black. This is:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

From the given information, we know that P(W|B) is 0.8 and P(B) is 0.15. We also know that P(~B) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85. To find P(W|~B), we need to consider the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, P(W|~B) is 0.2 (or 20%).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
