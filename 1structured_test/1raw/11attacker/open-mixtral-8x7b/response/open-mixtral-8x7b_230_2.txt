To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We are given P(B|A) and can calculate P(B|A') as follows:
- P(B|A') = 0.15 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 15% of the time, since 15% of the population is black)

Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1275
= 0.2475

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2475
â‰ˆ 0.485

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.485 or 48.5%.
