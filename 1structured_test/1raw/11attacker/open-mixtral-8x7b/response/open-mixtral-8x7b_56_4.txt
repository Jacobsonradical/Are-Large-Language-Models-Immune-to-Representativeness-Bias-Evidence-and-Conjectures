Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the witness's accuracy when identifying white people, only black people.
3. So, to keep things simple, let's assume that the witness has the same accuracy rate for both races. This assumption might not be accurate in real life, but it's the best we can do with the information given.

Now let's calculate the probability:

1. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black is 0.2 (20%).
3. Since we don't know the attacker's actual race, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.
4. This is a classic case of Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, P(I|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, and P(I|W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white.
5. We want to find P(B|I) = P(I and B) / P(I), where P(I and B) is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness identifies the attacker as black, and P(I) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
6. P(I and B) = P(B) * P(I|B) = (0.15) * (0.8) = 0.12
7. P(I and W) = P(W) * P(I|W) = (0.85) * (0.2) = 0.17
8. P(I) = P(I and B) + P(I and W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
9. Therefore, P(B|I) = P(I and B) / P(I) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41. However, this answer comes with the caveat that we assumed the same accuracy rate for both races, which might not be accurate in real life.
