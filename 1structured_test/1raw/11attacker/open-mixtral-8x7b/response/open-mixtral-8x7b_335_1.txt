To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate P(B|not A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population in the city is black, P(A) = 0.15.

Similarly, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (white). Since 85% of the population in the city is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.36}.
