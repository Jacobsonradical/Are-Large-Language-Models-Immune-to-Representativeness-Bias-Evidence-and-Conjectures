To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white, where ~A denotes 'not A')
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

However, since probabilities should be between 0 and 1, we can just keep two decimal places:

{probability: 0.41}
