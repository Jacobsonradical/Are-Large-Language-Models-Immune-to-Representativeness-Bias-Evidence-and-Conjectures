To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define our terms:
- H: The attacker is black.
- D: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(D | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(D | ~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to calculate P(H | D), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H | D) = P(D | H) \* P(H) / P(D)

To calculate P(D), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(D) = P(D | H) \* P(H) + P(D | ~H) \* P(~H)

First, let's calculate P(D | ~H):
- P(D | ~H) = 1 - P(~D | ~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, let's calculate P(D):
- P(D) = P(D | H) \* P(H) + P(D | ~H) \* P(~H) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H | D):
- P(H | D) = P(D | H) \* P(H) / P(D) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414,}
