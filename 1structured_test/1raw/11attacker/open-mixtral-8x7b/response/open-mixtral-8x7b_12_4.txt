To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possible scenarios that could lead to the observation B. This includes both the case where the attacker is actually black (A) and the case where the attacker is white (A') and the witness makes a mistake identifying them as black.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
