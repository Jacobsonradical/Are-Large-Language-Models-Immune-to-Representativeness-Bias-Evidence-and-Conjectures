To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black.
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know from the question that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, to calculate P(W), we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is P(W|~A) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, P(~A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
