To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can use it to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness and the population.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, which is given as 15% or 0.15. Similarly, P(W) is the probability that a random person is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Let's denote P(W|Witness identifies black) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, given that the person is white. From the problem, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(W|Witness identifies black) = 0.2.

Let's denote P(B|Witness identifies black) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, given that the person is black. From the problem, we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, so P(B|Witness identifies black) = 0.8.

We want to find P(B|Witness identifies black), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|Witness identifies black) = P(Witness identifies black|B) * P(B) / P(Witness identifies black).

We can calculate P(Witness identifies black|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8.

We can calculate P(Witness identifies black) as the total probability that the witness identifies a person as black, which is P(Witness identifies black|B) * P(B) + P(Witness identifies black|W) * P(W). This simplifies to 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|Witness identifies black) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
