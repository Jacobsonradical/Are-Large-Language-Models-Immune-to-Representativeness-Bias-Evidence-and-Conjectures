Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't know whether the witness identified a person as black because they were sure or because they made an error.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to calculate the total accurate identification rate for black people.
4. This means that when the person is actually black, the witness should correctly identify them as black 80% of the time and incorrectly identify them as white 20% of the time.
5. According to the city's demographics, 15% of the population is black.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, which is a number between 0 and 1}
