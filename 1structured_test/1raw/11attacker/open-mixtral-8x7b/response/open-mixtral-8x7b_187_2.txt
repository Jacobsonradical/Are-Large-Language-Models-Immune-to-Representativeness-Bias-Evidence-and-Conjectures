To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85%), A as the event of being the attacker, and W as the event of being identified as black by the witness.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)]

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15
P(W) = 0.85
P(W|B) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as white)
P(B|B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in P(B|A). Since A is the attacker, and we don't know their race, we need to consider both possibilities: A is black (A=B) and A is white (A=W).

P(A=B) = P(A=W) = 0.5 (equal probabilities since we don't know the attacker's race)

Now, let's find P(A|B) and P(A|W):

P(A=B|B) = 1 (if the person is black, then they are the attacker, given that the attacker is black)
P(A=W|B) = 0 (if the person is black, they cannot be the attacker if the attacker is white)

P(A=W|W) = 1 (if the person is white, then they are the attacker, given that the attacker is white)
P(A=B|W) = 0 (if the person is white, they cannot be the attacker if the attacker is black)

Now we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = [P(A=B|B) * P(B)] / [P(A=B|B) * P(B) + P(A=B|W) * P(W)]
= [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85]
= 0.15 / 0.15
= 1

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should also consider the accuracy of the witness in identifying black people:

P(A=B|B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black)

Now we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = [P(A=B|B) * P(B)] / [P(A=B|B) * P(B) + P(A=B|W) * P(W)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85]
= 0.12 / 0.12
= 1

The witness identified the attacker as black, and the witness is 80% accurate when identifying black people. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information, is 1.

Answer: {probability: 1}
