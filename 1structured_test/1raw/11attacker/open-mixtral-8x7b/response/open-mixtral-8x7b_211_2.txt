Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't know if the witness correctly identified the attacker as black or made an error.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
