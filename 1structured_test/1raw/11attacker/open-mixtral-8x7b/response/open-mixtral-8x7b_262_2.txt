Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's race means that we cannot use this information directly.
3. Instead, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we want to find the probability that this identification is correct.
5. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% black population)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

Where ~B is the complement of B, i.e., the attacker is white. We are given:
- P(~B) = 0.85 (85% white population)
- P(W|~B) = 1 - 0.2 (witness wrongly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, so they correctly identify white people as white 80% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.68
P(W) = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(B|W) = 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15}
