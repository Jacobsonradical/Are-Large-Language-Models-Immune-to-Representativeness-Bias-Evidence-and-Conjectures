To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black = 0.15 (from the information given)
P(~B) = probability the attacker is not black = 0.85 (from the information given)
P(W|B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 1 (assuming the witness identified the attacker correctly as black)
P(W|~B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (from the information given)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided is approximately 0.4688.
