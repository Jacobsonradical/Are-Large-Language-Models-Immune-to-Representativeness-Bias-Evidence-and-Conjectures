To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time) where A' is the complementary event of A (the attacker is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
       = 0.15 / 0.32
       â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
