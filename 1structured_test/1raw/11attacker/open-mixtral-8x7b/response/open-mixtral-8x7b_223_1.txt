To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the attacker is black
W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(not A) = 0.85 (100% - 15%). We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black. Therefore, P(W|not A) = 0.2 (20% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
