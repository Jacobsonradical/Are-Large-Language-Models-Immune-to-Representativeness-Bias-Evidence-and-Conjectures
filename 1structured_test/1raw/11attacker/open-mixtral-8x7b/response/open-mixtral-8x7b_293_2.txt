To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
