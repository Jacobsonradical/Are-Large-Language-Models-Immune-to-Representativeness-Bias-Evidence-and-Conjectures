To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have:

P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability, based on the information that 15% of the population is black)
P(W|not B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as white, given that they are not black, based on the witness's abilities and the information that the population is 85% white)
P(not B) = 0.85
P(B|not W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that they are not white, based on the witness's abilities and the information that the population is 15% black)
P(W|B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as white, given that they are black, based on the witness's abilities and the information that the population is 15% black)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

We first need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white. We have:

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)
= (0.2 \* 0.15) + (0.8 \* 0.85)
= 0.18 + 0.68
= 0.86

So, P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)
= (0.2 \* 0.15) / 0.86
= 0.03

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.03 or 3%.

Answer: {probability: 0.03}
