To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we have:

P(B|A) = 80% = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - the attacker is black (A) or the attacker is white (A'), and use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We are given that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and the proportion of white people in the city is 85%. Therefore, P(B|A') = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4532

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4532}
