To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the probability that a witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%). We also know that P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) in this city.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities that lead to the observation B. This includes both the case where the attacker is actually black (A) and the case where the attacker is white (A') but the witness mistakenly identifies him as black. We can express this as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

The term P(B|A') is the probability that a witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%). The term P(A') is the probability that a random attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%) in this city.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
