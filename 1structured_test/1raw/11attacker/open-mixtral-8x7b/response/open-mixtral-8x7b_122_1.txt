To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event A).

Using Bayes' theorem, this is:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

From the data, P(B) = 0.15 (15% black population)
P(A|B) is the accuracy of the witness when the true race is black, which is 0.8 (80% correct)

Calculating P(A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, involves both the true black attacker cases and the false black attacker cases (when the attacker is white but misidentified as black). This is:
P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)
= P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8)(0.15) + [1 - P(not A|not B)] * (1 - 0.15)

The term P(not A|not B) is the probability of the witness not identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is black, they must be wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is white. So, P(not A|not B) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the expression for P(A):
P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(B|A):
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.343.
