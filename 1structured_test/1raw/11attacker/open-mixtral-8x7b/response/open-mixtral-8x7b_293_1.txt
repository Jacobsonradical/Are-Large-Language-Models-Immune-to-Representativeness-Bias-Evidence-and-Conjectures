To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85). Let's also denote P(E|B) as the probability of the event E (witness identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black, and P(E|W) as the probability of the event E given that the attacker is white.

Using the information provided, we have P(E|B) = 1 (the witness always identifies the correct race when the person is black), and P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time when the person is white).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / (P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)). Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|E) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4688.
