To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events of interest are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black". Let's denote these events as B and W, respectively.

According to the information provided:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

First, calculate P(W|~B) * P(~B):
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
So, P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17]
â‰ˆ 0.315

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.315.
