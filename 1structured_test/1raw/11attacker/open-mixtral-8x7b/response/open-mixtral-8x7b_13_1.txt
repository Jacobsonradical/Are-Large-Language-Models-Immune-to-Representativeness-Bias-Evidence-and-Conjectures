To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given data, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is white (A'). We are given P(W|A) and P(W|A'), so we can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
         = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
           = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
           = 0.12 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
