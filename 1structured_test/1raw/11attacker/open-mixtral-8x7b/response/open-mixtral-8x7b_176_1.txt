To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the problem, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (or 80%). Similarly, P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

We also know that P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (or 15%), and P(not A) is the probability that a random attacker is white, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.41}.
