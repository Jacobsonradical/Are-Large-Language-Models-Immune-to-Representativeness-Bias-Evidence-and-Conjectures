To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = Probability that the attacker is black (to be estimated)
P(W) = Probability that the attacker is white = 1 - P(B)
P(H|B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 (from the information provided)
P(H|W) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white = 0.2 (from the information provided, this is the error rate when the witness is supposed to identify whites)
P(B)|H = Posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified the attacker as black

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|H) = (P(H|B) * P(B)) / (P(H|B) * P(B) + P(H|W) * P(W))

We know P(H|B), P(H|W), and P(W) = 1 - P(B). We don't know P(B), but since 85% of the population in the city is white, we can infer that the remaining 15% is black, so a reasonable prior for P(B) could be 0.15.

P(B|H) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36. This estimate takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being black and the accuracy of the witness's identifications for black and white people.
