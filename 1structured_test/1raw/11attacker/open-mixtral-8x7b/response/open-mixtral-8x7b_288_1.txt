To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being black, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person is black in the city)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find: P(A|B) (probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
