To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black,
- P(A') as the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and
- P(W'|A') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W'|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W'|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.034)

P(A|W) = 0.096 / 0.13

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.7385 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.7385}
