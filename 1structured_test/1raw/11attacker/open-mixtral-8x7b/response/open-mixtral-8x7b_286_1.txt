Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about which race the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify as black. 
3. To simplify, let's assume that the witness is equally likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black as they are to mistakenly identify a black person as white. This is an assumption, but it's the best we can do with the information given.
4. Under these assumptions, the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.
5. Similarly, the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.
6. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is therefore 12 / (3 + 12) = 0.8 or 80%.

So, {probability: 0.8}
