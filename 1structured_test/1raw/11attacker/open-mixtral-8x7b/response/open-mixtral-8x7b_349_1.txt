To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and the witness is correct, and that the attacker is not black (white) and the witness is incorrect. 

P(W) = P(W and B) + P(W and not B)
= P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, finally, P(B|W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.414

Answer: {probability: 0.414}
