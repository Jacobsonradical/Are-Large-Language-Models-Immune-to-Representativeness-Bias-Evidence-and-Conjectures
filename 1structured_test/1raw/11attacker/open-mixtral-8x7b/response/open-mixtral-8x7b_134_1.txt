To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that a person is black in the city, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
P(~B) is the probability that a person is white in the city, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(W|~B) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Now let's calculate the probabilities:
P(W|B) * P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15)
P(W|~B) * P(~B) = (0.2) * (0.85)

So,
P(B|W) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3077 or 30.77%

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3077}
