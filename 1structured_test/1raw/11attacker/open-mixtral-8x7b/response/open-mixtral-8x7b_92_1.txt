To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In our case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race as black with a probability of 80%, or 0.8, and incorrectly identifies a person's race as black with a probability of 20%, or 0.2. Since we don't know if the witness actually saw the attacker's race, we cannot directly calculate P(B|A) or P(B|A'), where A' is "the attacker is not black".

However, we can calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(B), as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931034482759

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
