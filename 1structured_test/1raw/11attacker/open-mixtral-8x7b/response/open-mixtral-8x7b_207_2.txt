Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to say that the attacker is more likely to be white.
4. But the witness has identified the attacker as black, and we are given a specific error rate for the witness.
5. So, even though the overall population is predominantly white, the information about the witness's identification and error rate suggests that the attacker is more likely to be black, considering the witness's statement.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We have P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness saying black given that the attacker is black)
      and P(B) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being black, from the city statistics)

We need to calculate P(W), which is the total probability of the witness saying black. This can occur in two ways:
- When the attacker is actually black, which happens with a probability of P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15
- When the attacker is white but the witness mistakenly identifies them as black, which happens with a probability of P(W|W) * P(W) = 0.2 * 0.85

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, substituting these values back into Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
