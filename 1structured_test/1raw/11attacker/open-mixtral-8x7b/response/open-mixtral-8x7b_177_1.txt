To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not black, using the fact that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

We can also calculate P(not B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, they must mistakenly identify a black person as not black 20% of the time).

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138}.
