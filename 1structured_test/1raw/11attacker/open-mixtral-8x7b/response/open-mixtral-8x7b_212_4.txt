To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B and the event that the witness identified the attacker as black as W. We need to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

From the information provided, we have:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred by identifying a non-black person as black, with an error rate of 20% for white people, who make up 85% of the population)

Now we can compute P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B))
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(B|W) ≈ 0.491

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.491}
