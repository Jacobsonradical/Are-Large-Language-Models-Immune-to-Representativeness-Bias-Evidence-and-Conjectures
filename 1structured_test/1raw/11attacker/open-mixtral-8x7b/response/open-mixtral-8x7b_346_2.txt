To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a non-black person as black)
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
