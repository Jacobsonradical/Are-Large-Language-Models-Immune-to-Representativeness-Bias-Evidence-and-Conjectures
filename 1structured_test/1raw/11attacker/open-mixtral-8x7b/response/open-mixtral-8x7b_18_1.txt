To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We're interested in finding P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is white (A'). We have P(W|A) and P(A) already. We also know that P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time) and P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
