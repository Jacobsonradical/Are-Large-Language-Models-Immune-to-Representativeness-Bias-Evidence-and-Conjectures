To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's find P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black. From the information given, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race. We can find this by considering the two possible races of the attacker and the true and false positive rates:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

We already know P(W|A) and P(A). To find P(W|~A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time for people of other races: P(W|~A) = 0.2 * (1 - P(A)) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.207.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.207 = 0.5792 (rounded to four decimal places).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5792, or 57.92%.
