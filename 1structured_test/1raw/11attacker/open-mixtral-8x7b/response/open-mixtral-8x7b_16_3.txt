To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information: the reliability of the witness and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (prior probability).
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white (prior probability).
- P(W|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white given that the attacker is white (reliability of the witness).
- P(B|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (reliability of the witness).
- P(Witness|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (what we want to find).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities using the racial composition of the city:
P(B) = 15% = 0.15
P(W) = 85% = 0.85

Since the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have:
P(Witness|B) = 0.8
P(Witness|W) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We want to find P(B|Witness), so we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|Witness) = P(Witness|B) * P(B) / (P(Witness|B) * P(B) + P(Witness|W) * P(W))

Plug the numbers in:
P(B|Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculate the result:
P(B|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.375}.
