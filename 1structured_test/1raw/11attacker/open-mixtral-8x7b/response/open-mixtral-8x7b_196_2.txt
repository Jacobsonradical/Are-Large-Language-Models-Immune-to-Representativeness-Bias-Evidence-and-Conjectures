Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have any information about the attacker's actual race, only the probability of different racial compositions in the city.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude the attacker's race. The witness's account is not enough evidence to override the prior probability based on the city's racial composition. Therefore, the estimate should still reflect the city's racial makeup.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
