To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
