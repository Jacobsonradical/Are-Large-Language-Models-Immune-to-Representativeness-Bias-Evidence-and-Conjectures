To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(W|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (which is the complement of A, denoted as not A)

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)

P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, then the witness's identification is always correct)

P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)

To find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to compute P(A|W), which is given by Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / ( P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) )

Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A), then P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, and:

P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore,

P(A|W) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.17)) = 0.4627 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4627.
