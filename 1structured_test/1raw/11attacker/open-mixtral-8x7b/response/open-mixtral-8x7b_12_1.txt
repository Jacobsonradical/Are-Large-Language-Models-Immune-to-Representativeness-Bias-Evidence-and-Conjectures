To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(W|A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8 (assuming the witness is correct)
- P(W|not A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 20% or 0.2 (assuming the witness makes an error)
- P(not A): Probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
