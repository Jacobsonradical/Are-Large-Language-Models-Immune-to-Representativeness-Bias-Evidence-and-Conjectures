To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85). Let's also denote P(E|B) as the probability of the event E (witness identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black, and P(E|W) as the probability of the event E given that the attacker is white.

We know that P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time), and P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
