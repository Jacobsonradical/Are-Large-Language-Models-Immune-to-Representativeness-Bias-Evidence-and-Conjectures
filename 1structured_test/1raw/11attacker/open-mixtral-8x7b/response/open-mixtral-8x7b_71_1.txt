To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, event A is the attacker being black and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of non-black identifications)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Calculating P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Calculating P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of non-black identifications)

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138 (rounded to five decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
