To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black." Let's denote these events as B and W, respectively:

* P(B) is the prior probability that a random attacker is black, given the city's population.
* P(W|B) is the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness.
* P(W|¬B) is the probability that a non-black attacker is identified as black by the witness.
* P(¬B) is the prior probability that a random attacker is not black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B).

Using these notations, Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B))

We are given:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Calculating the above expression:

P(B|W) ≈ 0.3846 (38.46%, or approximately 0.38 as a probability)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.38, or 38%.
