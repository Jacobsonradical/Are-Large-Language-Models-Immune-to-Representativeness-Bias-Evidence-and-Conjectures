To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B|A): Probability of correctly identifying a black attacker as black = 0.8
2. P(A'): Probability of the attacker being white = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
3. P(B|A'): Probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black = 0.2
4. P(A & B): Probability of correctly identifying a black attacker as black and the attacker actually being black = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
5. P(A' & B): Probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black and the attacker actually being white = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
6. P(B) = P(A & B) + P(A' & B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
