To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We're interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's race. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') where A' is the complement of A (attacker is white), and P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black), P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Therefore, P(W) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.345}
