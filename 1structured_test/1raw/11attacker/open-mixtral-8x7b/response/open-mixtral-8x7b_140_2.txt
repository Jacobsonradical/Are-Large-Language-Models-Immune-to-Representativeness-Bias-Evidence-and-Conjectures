To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black.

From the information given, we have:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% accuracy)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% accuracy, and 15% of the population is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85)
P(A|W) ≈ 0.767

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.767}
