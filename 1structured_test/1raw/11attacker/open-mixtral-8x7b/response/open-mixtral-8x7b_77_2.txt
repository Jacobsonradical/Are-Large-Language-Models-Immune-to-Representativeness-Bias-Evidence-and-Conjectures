To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

To find P(B), we need to consider all possibilities, i.e., the attacker is either black or white. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and since the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138}.
