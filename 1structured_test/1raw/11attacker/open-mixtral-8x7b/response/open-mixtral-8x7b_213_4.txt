To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and that the attacker is not black. So:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.41.
