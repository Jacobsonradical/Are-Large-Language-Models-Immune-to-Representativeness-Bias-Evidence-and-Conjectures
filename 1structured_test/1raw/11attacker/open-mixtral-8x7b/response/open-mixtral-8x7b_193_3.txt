To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem definition:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities, both when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

- P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
  - So, P(B and not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
