To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We can calculate P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ ¬A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(¬A) * P(B|¬A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.255

Then, using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B ∩ A) / P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.255 ≈ 0.4667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4667}
