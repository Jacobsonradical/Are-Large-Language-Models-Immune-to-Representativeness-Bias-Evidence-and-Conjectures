To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the probability of a hypothesis (A) given some observed evidence (B) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of the hypothesis:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black".

From the information given, we have:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people as black)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white people as black)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.362

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.362.
