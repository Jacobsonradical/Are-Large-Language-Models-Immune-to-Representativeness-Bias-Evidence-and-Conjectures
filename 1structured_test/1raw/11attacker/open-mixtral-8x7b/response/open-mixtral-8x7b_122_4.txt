To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - The event that the attacker is black
W - The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are asked to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. From Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

We know P(W|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(W|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is given as 20% or 0.2, and P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we have all the components to calculate P(A|W):

P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the population that is not black)
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.25 + 0.17 = 0.42

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.2957, which is around 29.57%.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2957}
