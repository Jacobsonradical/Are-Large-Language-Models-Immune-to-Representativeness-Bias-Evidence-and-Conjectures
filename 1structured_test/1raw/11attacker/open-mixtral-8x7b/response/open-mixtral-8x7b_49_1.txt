To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (the attacker is black) and B (a witness identifies the attacker as black).

Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

1. P(A): The probability of the attacker being black. According to point b, this is 15% or 0.15.

2. P(B|A): The probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

3. P(B): The probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of identifying a black attacker as black and a white attacker as black. So, P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

   We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 and P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 (since the witness errs 20% of the time) = 0.2.

   Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

4. Now we can calculate P(A|B):

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138}.
