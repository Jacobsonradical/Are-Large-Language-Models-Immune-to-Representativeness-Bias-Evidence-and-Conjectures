To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

From the data, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness identifies a white person as black. This happens with probability P(W|~B) where ~B denotes the complementary event of B (the attacker is white). Since the population is 85% white and the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, we have P(W|~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.42

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the available evidence is approximately 0.42.
