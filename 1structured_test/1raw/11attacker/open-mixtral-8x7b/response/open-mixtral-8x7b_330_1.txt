Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given that the victim couldn't see the attacker, we can only use the city's population statistics and the witness's statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.
4. To do this, we would calculate the weighted average of the attacker being black, given the witness's report, weighted by the accuracy of the witness, and the attacker being black by chance, weighted by the city's population statistics.
5. However, without knowing the direction of the errors, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate in the requested format. The information provided is not sufficient to make a reliable estimate.
