To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define our terms:

- Event A: The attacker is black
- Event W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:

- P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(W|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black attacker)
- P(W|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black)
- P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white)

Now we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
