To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on city population statistics)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possible cases: the attacker is black (A), and the attacker is not black (A').  That is, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A').

P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

If the attacker is not black, they are white, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a person as black). So, P(B and A') = P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Thus, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
