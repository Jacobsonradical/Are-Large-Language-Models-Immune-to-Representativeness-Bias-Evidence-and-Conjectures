To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know P(A), the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15. We also know P(B|A), the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black. This is a combination of the cases where the attacker is actually black and the cases where the attacker is white but the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345.
