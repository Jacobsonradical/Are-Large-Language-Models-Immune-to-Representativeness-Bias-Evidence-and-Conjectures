To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's define P(S|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, and P(S|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. We are given P(S|B) = 0.8 and P(S|W) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B|S), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|S) = (P(S|B) * P(B)) / (P(S|B) * P(B) + P(S|W) * P(W))

P(B|S) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(B|S) â‰ˆ 0.2817

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.2817}
