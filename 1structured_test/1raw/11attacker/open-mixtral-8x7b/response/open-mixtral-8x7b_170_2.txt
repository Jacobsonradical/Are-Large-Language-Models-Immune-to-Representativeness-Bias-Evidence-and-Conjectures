To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider all possible scenarios for W, which are:
- The attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as black (P(W|A) * P(A))
- The attacker is black and the witness mistakenly identifies him as white (1 - P(W|A)) * P(A)
- The attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black (P(W|not A) * P(not A))

We are given:
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(W|A)) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8*0.15 + (1-0.8)*0.15 + 0.2*0.85
= 0.12 + 0.03 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8*0.15 / 0.32
= 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.375}
