To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in computing P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To compute P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black or the attacker is white. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A), where ~A denotes the complementary event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(W|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is given as the error rate when identifying a white person, i.e., 0.2.

Therefore, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.3333

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
