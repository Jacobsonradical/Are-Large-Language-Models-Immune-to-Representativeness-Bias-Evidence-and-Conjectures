To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is black, so this probability is 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B), the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying the attacker as black in two cases: if the attacker is black and if the attacker is white:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases). The probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (100% - 15%). So:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
