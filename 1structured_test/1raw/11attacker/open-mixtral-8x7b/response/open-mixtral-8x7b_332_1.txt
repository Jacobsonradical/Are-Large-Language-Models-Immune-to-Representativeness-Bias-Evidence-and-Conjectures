To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85% or 0.85). 

We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (0.8) and errs 20% of the time (0.2). We can denote these probabilities as P(W | B) and P(B | W) respectively.

Now, we want to find P(B | W'), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B | W') = [P(W' | B) * P(B)] / [P(W' | B) * P(B) + P(W' | W) * P(W)]

We are given P(B) and P(W), and we can calculate P(W' | B) as the true positive rate (0.8), and P(W' | W) as the false positive rate (0.2).

So,

P(B | W') = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this expression gives us approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.

Hence, the answer is: {probability: 0.375}
