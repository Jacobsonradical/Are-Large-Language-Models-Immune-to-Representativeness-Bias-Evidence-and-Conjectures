To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, and P(H|B) as the probability of the hypothesis (witness identifying the race correctly) given that the attacker is black. Similarly, P(H|W) is the probability of the hypothesis given that the attacker is white.

From the information given, P(H|B) = 0.8 and P(H|W) = 0.2. Also, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

To find P(B|H), the probability that the attacker is black given the hypothesis, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|H) = [P(H|B) * P(B)] / [P(H|B) * P(B) + P(H|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|H) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|H) â‰ˆ 0.2817

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2817 or 28.17%.
