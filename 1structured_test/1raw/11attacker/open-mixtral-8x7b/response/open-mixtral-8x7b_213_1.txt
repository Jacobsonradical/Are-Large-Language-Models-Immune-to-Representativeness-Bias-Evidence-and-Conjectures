To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that a person is black in the city). 

To calculate P(B|A), we need to find the probability of a witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black, which is 0.8 (80% according to the problem description).

To calculate P(B|¬A), we need to find the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a non-black (white) attacker as black, which is 0.15 (15% of 80% misidentification rate for whites).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's compute the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.15)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1275
= 0.2475

Now, let's compute the numerator:
P(B|A) * P(A)
= (0.8)*(0.15)
= 0.12

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator to get the probability:
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2475 ≈ 0.485

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.485 or 48.5%.
