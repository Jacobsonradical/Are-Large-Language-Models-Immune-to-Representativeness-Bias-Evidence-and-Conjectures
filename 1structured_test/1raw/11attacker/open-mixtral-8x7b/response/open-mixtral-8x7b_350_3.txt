Let's reason through this:

1. We cannot determine the race of the attacker based on the given information about the city's population, as the attack could have been carried out by either a white or a black person.
2. However, we do have information about a witness who was assessed to be correct 80% of the time in determining race under similar conditions.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and considering the witness's 80% accuracy rate, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

Probability: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

The answer is: {probability: 0.29}
