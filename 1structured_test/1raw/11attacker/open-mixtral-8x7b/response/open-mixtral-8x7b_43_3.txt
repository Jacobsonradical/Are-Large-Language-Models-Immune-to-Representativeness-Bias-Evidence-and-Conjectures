Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the number of times the witness identified the race correctly or incorrectly in this specific case.
3. Thus, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black or white based on this information alone.

However, if we must provide an estimate based on the given city demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white)

Using the formula, we can calculate:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker is chosen at random from the city's population, which is not specified in the problem.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
