To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (white),
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(~A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / ( P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) )

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / ( 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 )

P(A|B) = 0.096 / 0.156

P(A|B) = 0.6153846153846154

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.615 (61.5%).
