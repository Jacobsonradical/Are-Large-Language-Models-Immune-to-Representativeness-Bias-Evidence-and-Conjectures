Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't adjust our prior probabilities based on the error rate.
4. Therefore, we must rely on the base rates of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.

Given these considerations, the best estimate we can make is to stick with the base rate of the black population, which is 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
