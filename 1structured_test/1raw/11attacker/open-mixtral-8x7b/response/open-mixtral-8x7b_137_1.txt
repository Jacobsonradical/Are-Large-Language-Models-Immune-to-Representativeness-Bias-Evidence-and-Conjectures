To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, and B be the event that the attacker is actually black. We are interested in finding P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(A|B') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time when the person is not black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4137931}
