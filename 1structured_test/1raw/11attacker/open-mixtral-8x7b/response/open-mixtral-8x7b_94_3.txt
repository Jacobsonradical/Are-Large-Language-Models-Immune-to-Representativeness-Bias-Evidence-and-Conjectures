Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We don't know the attacker's race, but we do know the general population's racial distribution in the city.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- A as the event that the suspect is black
- B as the event that the witness identified the suspect as black

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a random person being black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the suspect is black and where the suspect is white.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
