To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Here, the two events are:

A: The attacker is black.
B: A witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given data, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is white)

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.5652

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5652}
