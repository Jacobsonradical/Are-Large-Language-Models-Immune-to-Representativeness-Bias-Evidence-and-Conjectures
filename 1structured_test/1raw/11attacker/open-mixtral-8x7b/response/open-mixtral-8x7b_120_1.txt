To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Bayes' theorem states P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the question, we are given:
P(A): Probability of an attacker being black = 0.15 (15%)
P(B|A): Probability of correctly identifying a black attacker = 0.8 (80%)

However, we are missing P(B), the total probability of identifying the attacker as black. This includes both correctly identifying a black attacker and mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
