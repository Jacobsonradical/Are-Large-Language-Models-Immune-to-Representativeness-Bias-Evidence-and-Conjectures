To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(W|not B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

First, calculate P(not B):
P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate the denominator of the Bayes' theorem:
P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.41, explanation: "The estimate is based on the given information and Bayes' theorem."}
