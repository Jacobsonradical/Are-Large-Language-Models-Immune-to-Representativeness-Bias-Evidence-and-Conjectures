To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

We also know P(W|A), the probability that a black attacker would be identified as black by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.

To find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race, we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
