To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) + P(W|not A) * (1 - 0.15)

Now, we need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This is the complement of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white, so P(W|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Substituting this into the equation for P(W), we get:
P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      = 0.321

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.321}
