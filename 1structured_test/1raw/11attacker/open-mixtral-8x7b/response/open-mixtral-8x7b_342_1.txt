To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white)

We want to find:
P(A|W) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
