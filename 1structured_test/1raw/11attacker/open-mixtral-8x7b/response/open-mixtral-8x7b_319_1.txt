To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is given as 15% or 0.15 in the question.

Next, we need to find P(W|A), the probability of a witness identifying a black attacker as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time in identifying black people, P(W|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(W|not A), the probability of a witness identifying a white attacker as black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time in identifying white people, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Finally, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that a random attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(not W|not A), the probability of a witness not identifying a white attacker as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time in identifying white people, P(not W|not A) = 0.8.

Therefore, P(W|not A) = 1 - P(not W|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A))

Substituting the values we found:

P(A|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Computing the result:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.36 or 36%.
