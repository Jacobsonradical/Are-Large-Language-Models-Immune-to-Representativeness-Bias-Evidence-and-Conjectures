To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, we are given:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(W|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black individual)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is white (¬A). Then, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A). 

We know P(W|A) and P(A), and from the problem statement, P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city). To find P(W|¬A), we use the complementary probability: P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (given that the witness incorrectly identifies a white individual 20% of the time).

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15 / 0.8
≈ 0.1875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the information is:

{probability: 0.1875}
