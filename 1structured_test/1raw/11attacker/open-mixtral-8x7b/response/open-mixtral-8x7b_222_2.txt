To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event times the probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the question, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white, and we want the probability that the attacker is not black)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.36 or 36%.
