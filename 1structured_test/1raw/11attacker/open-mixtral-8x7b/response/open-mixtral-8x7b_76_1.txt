To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know P(A), the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

We also know that P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, is 80% or 0.8.

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. To calculate this, we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. Using the law of total probability, we have P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A), where ~A denotes the event that the attacker is not black (white in this case).

We know P(W|A) and P(A), and from the given information, we also know P(W|~A), the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2, and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Therefore, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.321 or about 32.1%.

Answer: {probability: 0.321}
