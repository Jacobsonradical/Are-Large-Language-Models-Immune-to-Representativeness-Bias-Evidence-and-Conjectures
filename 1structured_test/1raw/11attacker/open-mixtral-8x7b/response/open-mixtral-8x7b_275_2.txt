Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they are more likely to mistake white people for black or vice versa.
3. Therefore, the most conservative approach here is to consider all possible directions of error, which means assuming that any error could have occurred in this case.
4. So, there are two possibilities to consider: the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, or the witness mistakenly identified a white attacker as black.
5. The probability of the second scenario (given that the witness identified the attacker as black) is the product of the probability that the attacker is white (15%), the probability that the witness identifies white as black (20%), and the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black.
6. Therefore, the probability of the second scenario is (0.15)*(0.20)*(1) = 0.03.
7. The probability of the first scenario is simply the probability that the attacker is black, which was given as 85%.
8. Since these are the only two possibilities, we can find the probability that the attacker is black by dividing the probability of the first scenario by the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios.

So, {probability: 0.85 / (0.85 + 0.03)} = {probability: 0.9655172413793104}
