To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. We are given that if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance the witness will mistakenly identify him/her as black. Since 85% of the population is white, we have:

P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (where A' is the event that the attacker is white)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4536

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information available, is approximately 0.4536 or 45.36%.
