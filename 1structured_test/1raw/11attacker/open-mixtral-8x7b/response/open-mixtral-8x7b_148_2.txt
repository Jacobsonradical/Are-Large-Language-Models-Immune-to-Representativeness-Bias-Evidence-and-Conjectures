To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a person is black in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~B) as the probability that a person is not black (white), which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black (white), which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4% if expressed as a percentage).
