To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black, which is 0.15.

We also know that P(W|A), the probability that a black person would be identified as black by the witness, is 0.8 (80%).

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability that the witness identifies anyone as black. To find this, we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

Here, ~A denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker being white. We are given that P(~A) = 0.85 (85%), and from the information about the witness, P(W|~A) = 0.2 (20%).

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
