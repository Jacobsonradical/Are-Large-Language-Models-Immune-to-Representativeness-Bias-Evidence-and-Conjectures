To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability of an attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15.

To calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black, we use the witness's ability to judge a person's race, which is 80% or 0.8.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, P(B|A'), is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black, which is 20% or 0.2. The probability of the attacker not being black, P(A'), is 85% or 0.85.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
