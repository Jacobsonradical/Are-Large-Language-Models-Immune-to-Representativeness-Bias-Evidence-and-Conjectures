To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (from the given information).
P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (from the given information).
P(W|W') as the probability of identifying the attacker as white given that the attacker is indeed white, which is 0.8 (from the given information).
P(B|B') as the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 (from the given information).

We want to find P(B|W'), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) / (P(W'|B) * P(B) + P(W'|W) * P(W))

We need to find P(W'|W), the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time, P(W'|W) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B|W'):

P(B|W') = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17) = 0.09 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.346

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.346.
