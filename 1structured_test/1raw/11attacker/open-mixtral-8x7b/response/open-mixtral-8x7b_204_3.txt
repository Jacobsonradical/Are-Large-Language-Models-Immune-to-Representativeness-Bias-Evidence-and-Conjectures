Let's reason through this problem:

1. We cannot determine the race of the attacker based on the given information about the city's population, as the victim couldn't see the attacker.
2. However, we have information about a witness who identified the attacker as black.
3. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race under similar conditions, and errs 20% of the time.

Now let's compute the probability:

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race.
We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

To find P(W), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually black and the case where the attacker is white:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.345}.
