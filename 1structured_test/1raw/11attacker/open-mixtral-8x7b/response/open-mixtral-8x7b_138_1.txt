To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, the population statistics give us the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

The witness's ability to judge a person's race is described by:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(not B|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 15% of the time, since half the population is white and the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(not B|not A) = 0.85 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 85% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.5172

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5172}
