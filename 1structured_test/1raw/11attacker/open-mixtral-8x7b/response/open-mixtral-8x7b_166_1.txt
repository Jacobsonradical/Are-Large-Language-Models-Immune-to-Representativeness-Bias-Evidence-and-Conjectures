To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.04 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black, so 85% is white)

We want to find P(A|B), which Bayes' theorem states is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting in the values we know:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.04 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.034)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.154
P(A|B) = 0.7761194029850746

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.7761194029850746}
