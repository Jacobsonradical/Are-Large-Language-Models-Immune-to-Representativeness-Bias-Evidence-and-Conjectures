To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
