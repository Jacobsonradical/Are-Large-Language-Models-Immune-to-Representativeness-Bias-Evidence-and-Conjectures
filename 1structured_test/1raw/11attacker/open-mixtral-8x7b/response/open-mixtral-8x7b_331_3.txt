Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to conclude that the attacker is more likely to be white.
4. But the witness has identified the attacker as black, and we need to take this into account.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker was actually black:
P(Correct ID | Attacker is Black) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker was actually white:
P(Incorrect ID | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (since the total probability of errors is 0.2, and the error here is identifying a white person as black)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:
P(Attacker is Black | Correct/Incorrect ID) = [P(Correct ID | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Correct ID | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Incorrect ID | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / 0.26
â‰ˆ 0.4615

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.4615}
