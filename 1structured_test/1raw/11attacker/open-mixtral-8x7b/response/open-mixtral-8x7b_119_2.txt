To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Pr(A) as the probability that the attacker is black, Pr(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white, Pr(W|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and Pr(W|~A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

From the given information, we know that Pr(W|A) = 1 (the witness correctly identified the race when the person is black), Pr(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is white), Pr(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and Pr(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Bayes' theorem states:

Pr(A|W) = [Pr(W|A) * Pr(A)] / [Pr(W|A) * Pr(A) + Pr(W|~A) * Pr(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

Pr(A|W) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
Pr(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
Pr(A|W) = 0.15 / 0.32
Pr(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4688.
