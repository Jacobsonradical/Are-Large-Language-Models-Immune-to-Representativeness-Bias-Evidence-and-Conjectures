To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.44

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.44.
