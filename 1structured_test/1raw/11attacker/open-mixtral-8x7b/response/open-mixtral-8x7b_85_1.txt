To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the hypotheses as H1: the attacker is black and H2: the attacker is white. Let D be the observed data: a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H1|D) = P(D|H1) * P(H1) / (P(D|H1) * P(H1) + P(D|H2) * P(H2))

We are given that P(H1) = 0.15 and P(H2) = 0.85 (from part b).

To calculate P(D|H1), we need to find the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the same as the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 80% or 0.8 (from part a).

To calculate P(D|H2), we need to find the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This is the same as the witness's error rate in identifying black people, which is 20% or 0.2 (from part a).

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the observed data:

P(H1|D) = P(D|H1) * P(H1) / (P(D|H1) * P(H1) + P(D|H2) * P(H2))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
