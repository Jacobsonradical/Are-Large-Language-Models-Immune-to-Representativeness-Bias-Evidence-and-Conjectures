Let's first calculate the probability that a random person chosen from the city is black:

P(Black) = 0.15

Given the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black, given these circumstances. This is a problem of conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to solve it:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identified as black) = P(Witness identified as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness identified as black)

We are given P(Witness identified as black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is black) = 0.15. To calculate P(Witness identified as black), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually black and the case where the attacker is white, since the witness might make an error:

P(Witness identified as black) = P(Witness identified as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identified as black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identified as black) = P(Witness identified as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness identified as black)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
