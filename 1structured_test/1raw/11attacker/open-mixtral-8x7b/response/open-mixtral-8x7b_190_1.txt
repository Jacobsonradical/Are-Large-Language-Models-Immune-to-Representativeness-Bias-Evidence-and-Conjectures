To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as black as W, and the event that the attacker is actually black as B. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

We are given:
1. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
2. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)

We need to calculate P(W|~B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is equivalent to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are wrong 20% of the time:

P(W|~B) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(~B), the probability that the attacker is not black:

P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
