To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, which is 0.8.
- P(A): probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). Thus:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We're given P(B|A), and we need to find P(B|A'), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is not black. Since 85% of the population is white, P(A') = 0.85. The witness errs 20% of the time when identifying the race, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.41 (41%).
