To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the question, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.80, and incorrectly identifies a black person as white with probability 0.20. So, P(B|A) = 0.80.

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that he could be either white or black. This is given by:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
