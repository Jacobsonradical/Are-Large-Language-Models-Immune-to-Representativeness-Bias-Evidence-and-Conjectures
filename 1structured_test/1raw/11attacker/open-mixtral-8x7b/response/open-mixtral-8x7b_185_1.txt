To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We are given no information about the witness's ability to identify a non-black person as non-black, but we can assume that they are correct 100% of the time (i.e., they never misidentify a non-black person as black). This is because the only way for the witness to identify the attacker as black is if they are actually black (event A) or if they are not black but the witness mistakenly identifies them as black (event B'|A'). Since we are given no information about the rate of such mistakes, we must assume that they do not occur.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8)(0.15) + (1)(0.85) = 0.15 + 0.85 = 0.1

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.1 = 0.12

So our estimate is {probability: 0.12, or 12%}.
