Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. When the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a chance they made an error and the attacker is actually white.
3. To find the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and ~B represent the event that the attacker is white.
Let W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black person as black)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (population is 15% black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (population is 85% white)

Now we can calculate:
P(W|B) * P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) = 0.12
P(W|~B) * P(~B) = (0.2)(0.85) = 0.17

Now we have:
P(B|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)] = 0.4138 (approximately)

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
