Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say whether the witness's error would increase or decrease the probability of the attacker being black.
4. Therefore, the most conservative estimate would be to use the base rate of black population in the city, which is 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
