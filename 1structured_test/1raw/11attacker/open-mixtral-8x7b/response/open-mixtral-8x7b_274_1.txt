To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are looking for P(B|W).

From the information given, we have:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3. P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.1445)
= 0.15 / 0.2945
= 0.5087 (approximately)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5087 or 50.87%.
