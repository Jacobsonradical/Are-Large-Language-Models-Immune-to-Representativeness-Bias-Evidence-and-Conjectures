To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being black, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
