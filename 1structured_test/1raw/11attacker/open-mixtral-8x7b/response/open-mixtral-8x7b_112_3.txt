To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
