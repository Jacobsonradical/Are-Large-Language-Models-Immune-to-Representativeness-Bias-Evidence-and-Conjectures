To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85%). Let's also denote P(O|B) as the probability of observing the given evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) if the attacker is indeed black, and P(O|W) as the probability of observing the given evidence if the attacker is white.

We want to find P(B|O), the probability that the attacker is black given the observed evidence. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|O) = P(O|B) * P(B) / [P(O|B) * P(B) + P(O|W) * P(W)]

From the problem statement, we have P(O|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifying race 80% of the time when the person is black), P(O|W) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifying race 20% of the time when the person is white), P(B) = 0.15, and P(W) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B|O):

P(B|O) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
