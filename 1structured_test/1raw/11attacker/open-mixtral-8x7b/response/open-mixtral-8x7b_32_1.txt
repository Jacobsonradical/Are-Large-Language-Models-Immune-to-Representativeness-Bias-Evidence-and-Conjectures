To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black.

From the problem statement, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(B|A) = 1, since if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify him as black.

To compute P(B|~A), we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a person's race:

P(B|~A) = 0.20

We can also compute P(~B), the probability that the witness does not identify the attacker as black:

P(~B) = P(~B|A) P(A) + P(~B|~A) P(~A)
= 0 (since P(~B|A) = 0) + (1 - 0.20) (1 - 0.15)
= 0.80 * 0.85
= 0.68

Finally, we can compute the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified him as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) P(A) / (P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|~A) P(~A))
= (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.47

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.47}
