To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- ~B as the event "the attacker is not black (i.e., white)"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"
- ~W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as not black (i.e., white)"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem statement, we have:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
3. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
4. P(~W|B) = 0.2 (the witness fails to identify a black person as black 20% of the time)
5. P(~W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness falsely identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) \* P(B)) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B))

We need to find P(W|~B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white. Since the witness misidentifies a white person as black 20% of the time, we have P(W|~B) = 0.2.

Now, we can fill in the values and compute P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17) = 0.09 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.346

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.346}
