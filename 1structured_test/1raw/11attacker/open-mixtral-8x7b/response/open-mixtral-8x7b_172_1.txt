To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black." Let's denote these events A and B, respectively.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 85% white and 15% black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability, and 85% of the population is white)

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) * P(A) ] / [ P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) ]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [ 0.8 * 0.15 ] / [ (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) ]

After calculating, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.44

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.44}
