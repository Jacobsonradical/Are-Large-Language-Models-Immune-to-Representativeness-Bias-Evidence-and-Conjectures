To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4524

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 45.24%.

Answer: {probability: 0.4524}
