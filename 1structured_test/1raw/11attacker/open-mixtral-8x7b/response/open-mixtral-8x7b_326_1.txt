To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem description, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black. Since the city's population is 15% black, we can assume that the proportion of black attackers is also 15%.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A').

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|A'), we need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|A') = 0.2.

We also need to find P(A'), which is the probability that the attacker is white, or 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
