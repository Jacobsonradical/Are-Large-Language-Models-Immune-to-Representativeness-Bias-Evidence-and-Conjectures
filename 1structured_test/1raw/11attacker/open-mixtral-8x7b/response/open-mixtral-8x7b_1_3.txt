To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

where ¬B denotes "the attacker is not black" (i.e., the attacker is white).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W), where P(W) can be computed as P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.17*0.85 = 0.203.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

{probability: 0.59,}

This is slightly less than 60%, indicating that while it is more likely than not that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification, there is still a significant chance that the attacker is white.
