To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possible scenarios. The witness can either be correct (W|A) or make an error, identifying a white person as black (W|~A). So, we need to calculate P(W|~A) as well, which is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is white. This probability is given as 0.2 (20% chance of error).

Since 85% of the population is white, P(~A) = 0.85, and thus, P(W|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(W), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
P(W) ≈ 0.2245

Now, we can finally calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2245
P(A|W) ≈ 0.5342

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.5342 or 53.42%.
