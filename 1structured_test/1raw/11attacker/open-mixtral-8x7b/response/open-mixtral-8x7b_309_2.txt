To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on city population statistics)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and that the attacker is white. Using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

Here, ~A denotes the complementary event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(~A) = 0.85 based on city population statistics. To calculate P(W|~A), we need to consider the false positive rate of the witness identifying a white person as black:

P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can finally calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
