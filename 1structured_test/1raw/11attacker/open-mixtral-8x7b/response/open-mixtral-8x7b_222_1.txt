To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event A).

Bayes' theorem states P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B): Probability that a person is black = 15% = 0.15
- P(A|B): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 80% = 0.8

However, we don't directly know P(A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying black people correctly and white people incorrectly as black:
P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)
= P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
