To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is black, based on city population statistics)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and that the attacker is white. Then:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random attacker is white, based on city population statistics)

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying black people and wrong 0% of the time when identifying white people, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.4535}
