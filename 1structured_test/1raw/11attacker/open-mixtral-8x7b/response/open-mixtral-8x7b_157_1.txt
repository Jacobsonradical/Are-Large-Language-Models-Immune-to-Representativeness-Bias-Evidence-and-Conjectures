To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(W|W') as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as white when the attacker is actually white, and P(B|B') as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black. We are given P(W|W') = 0.8 and P(B|B') = 0.2.

However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black, so we are interested in P(B|W'), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) / P(W')

We can calculate P(W') as follows:

P(W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) + P(W'|W) * P(W)

where P(W'|W) is the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white. Since the witness is only wrong 20% of the time, we have P(W'|W) = 1 - P(W|W') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W'):

P(W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) + P(W'|W) * P(W)
= 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.03 + 0.17
= 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B|W'):

P(B|W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) / P(W')
= 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.2
= 0.15 / 0.2
= 0.75

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.75}
