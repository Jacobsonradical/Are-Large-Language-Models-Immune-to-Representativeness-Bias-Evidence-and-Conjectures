To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85%). Given the witness's accuracy, P(W|wrong) = 0.2 and P(B|wrong) = 0.8, and P(W|correct) = 0.8 and P(B|correct) = 0.2. Now, we want to calculate P(B|witness reports black), which is:

P(B|witness reports black) = P(witness reports black|B) * P(B) / P(witness reports black)

We can calculate P(witness reports black|B) as P(witness reports black|B, correct) * P(correct) + P(witness reports black|B, wrong) * P(wrong) = 0.2 * 0.8 + 1 * 0.2 = 0.4.

Similarly, P(witness reports black|W) = P(witness reports black|W, correct) * P(correct) + P(witness reports black|W, wrong) * P(wrong) = 0 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

Now, we can calculate P(witness reports black) as P(witness reports black|B) * P(B) + P(witness reports black|W) * P(W) = 0.4 * 0.15 + 0.04 * 0.85 = 0.06 + 0.034 = 0.094.

Finally, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness reports black, is:

P(B|witness reports black) = P(witness reports black|B) * P(B) / P(witness reports black) = 0.4 * 0.15 / 0.094 â‰ˆ 0.6383.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.6383}.
