To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black). Let's denote this probability as P(B|W), where B is the event that the attacker is black and W is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B), the probability that a person is black in the city: 15% or 0.15
- P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black: 80% or 0.8

We need to find P(W), the probability of the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. We can calculate P(W) by considering the two possible races of the attacker and the witness's accuracy in identifying their race:

P(W) = P(W and B) + P(W and not B)
= P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is:

{probability: 0.345}
