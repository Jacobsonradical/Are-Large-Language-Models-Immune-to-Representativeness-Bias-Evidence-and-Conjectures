To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We can calculate this as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      = 0.413793103 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.41, explanation: The probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41% given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.}.
