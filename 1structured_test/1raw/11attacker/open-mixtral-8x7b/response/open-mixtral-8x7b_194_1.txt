To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - attacker is black
W - the attacker was identified as black

We're interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that they were identified as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), P(W|A) is the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8.

From statement (b), P(A) is the probability of an arbitrary attacker being black, which is 0.15.

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is either black or white and the witness identifies them correctly or incorrectly. This gives us:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.41}
