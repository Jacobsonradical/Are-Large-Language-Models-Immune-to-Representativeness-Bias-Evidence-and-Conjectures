To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 0.15, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white (which is 0.85, since 85% of the population is white)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (which is 1, since the attacker cannot misidentify themselves)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (which is 0.2, since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Then, Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.15) / ((1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

P(A|B) = 0.4286 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4286 or 42.86%.
