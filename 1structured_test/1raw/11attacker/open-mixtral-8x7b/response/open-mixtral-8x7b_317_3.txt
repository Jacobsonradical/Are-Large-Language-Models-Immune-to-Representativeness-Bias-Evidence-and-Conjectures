To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We can now calculate P(not A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(not A|W) = P(W and not A) / P(W)
= P(W|not A) * P(not A) / (P(W|not A) * P(not A) + P(W|A) * P(A))
= (0.2 * 0.85) / ((0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15))
= 0.17

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 1 - P(not A|W)
= 1 - 0.17
= 0.83

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83 or 83%.
