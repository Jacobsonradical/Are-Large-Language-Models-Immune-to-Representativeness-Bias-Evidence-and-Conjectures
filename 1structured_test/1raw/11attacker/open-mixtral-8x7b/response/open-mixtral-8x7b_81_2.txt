To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given).
P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black (which is 85% or 0.85 based on the information given).
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (which is 80% or 0.8 based on the information given).
P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (which is 20% or 0.2 based on the information given).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression will give us:
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36 or 36%

Therefore, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.36}
