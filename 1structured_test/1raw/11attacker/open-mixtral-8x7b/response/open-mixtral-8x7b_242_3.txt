To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can use it to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (known, 15%).
- P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (known, 85%).
- P(A|B) as the probability of identifying a black person as black (given, 80% or 0.8).
- P(A|W) as the probability of identifying a white person as black (given, 20% or 0.2).
- P(B|A) as the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is black given that they were identified as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values:

P(B|A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|A) = 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
