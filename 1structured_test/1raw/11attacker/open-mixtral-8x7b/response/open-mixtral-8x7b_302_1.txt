To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time). The total population is white, so P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race, using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.345}.
