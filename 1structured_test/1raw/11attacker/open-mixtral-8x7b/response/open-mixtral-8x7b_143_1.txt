To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the attacker being black and the witness identifying them correctly, and the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying them as black:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
