To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify him as black)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a non-black person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.46875}
