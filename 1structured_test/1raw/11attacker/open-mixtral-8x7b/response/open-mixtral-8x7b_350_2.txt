Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the witness's error - whether they are more likely to mistake white people for black or vice versa.
3. Therefore, we can only use the overall accuracy rate of the witness, which is 80% for black people and 80% for white people.
4. Given that 85% of the population is white, there's a higher chance that the attacker was white.
5. But since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to adjust our probability based on the witness's accuracy rate.
6. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%), while the probability that they made an error and the attacker is actually white is 0.2 (20%).
7. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).
8. To find the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
   Where B is the event that the attacker is black, W is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, and P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
9. Plugging in the numbers, we get:
   P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85)

The answer is: {probability: 0.545454545455, explanation: "Calculated using Bayes' theorem and the witness's accuracy rate and the population's racial composition."}
