To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a black person as black and a white person as black:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
