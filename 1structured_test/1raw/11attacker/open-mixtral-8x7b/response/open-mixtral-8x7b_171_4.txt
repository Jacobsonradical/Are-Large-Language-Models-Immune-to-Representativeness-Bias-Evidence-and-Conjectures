To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the problem statement, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 (80%), and incorrectly identifies a black person as white with probability 0.2 (20%). So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is P(W|B) = 0.8.

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is P(W|not B) = 0.15 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, and 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 of the population is non-black).

Now, we can calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1275)
â‰ˆ 0.4878

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4878 or 48.78%.
