To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, implying that they identified a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(A) = 0.05 (since 15% of the population is black, and the witness is equally likely to make an error for any race, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is the same as the probability that the witness identified a white person as black, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.05)

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.05}
