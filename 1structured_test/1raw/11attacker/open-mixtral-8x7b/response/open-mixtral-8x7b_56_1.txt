To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's calculate P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population is black, and assuming that the attacker is representative of the city population, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. We need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. The probability of the attacker being white is P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black, so P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345.
