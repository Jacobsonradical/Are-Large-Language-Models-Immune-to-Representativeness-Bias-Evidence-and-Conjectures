To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- P(B) as the probability that a person is black in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~B) as the probability that a person is not black (white), which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|B) as the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find:
- P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that they were identified as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives us approximately 0.36 or 36%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information, is {probability: 0.36}.
