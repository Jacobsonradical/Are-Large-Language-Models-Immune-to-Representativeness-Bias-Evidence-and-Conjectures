Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
3. However, since the attack happened from behind, the victim couldn't see the attacker's race. Thus, the information about the city's population doesn't directly apply to this case.
4. What we can use is the accuracy of the witness's race identification.
5. According to that, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct when identifying someone as black, and a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken.

Hence, the answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
