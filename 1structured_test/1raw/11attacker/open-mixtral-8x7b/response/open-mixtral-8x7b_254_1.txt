Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they're more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the information available, we can only determine the probability of the witness's identification being correct, not the actual probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, based on the given data, we cannot provide an accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

However, if we assume for the sake of argument that the witness's errors are symmetrical (i.e., they are equally likely to mistake a white person for a black person as they are to mistake a black person for a white person), then we could approximate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%).
- The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.15 * 0.2 (15% * 20%), since there's a 15% chance of a random person being white and a 20% chance of the witness making this specific error.
- Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83, or 83%, that the attacker is black.

Please note that this is a rough approximation based on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be different.

Answer: {probability: 0.83}
