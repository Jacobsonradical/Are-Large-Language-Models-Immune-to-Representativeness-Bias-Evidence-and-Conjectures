To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, event A is the witness identifying the attacker as black, and event B is the attacker actually being black.

We are given:
P(A|B) = 1 (the witness's identification is always correct when the attacker is actually black)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white, where B' denotes the complement of B)
P(A|B') = 0.2 (20% chance of misidentifying a white person as black)

We want to find:
P(B|A) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')]

Substituting the given values:
P(B|A) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.467

Answer: {probability: 0.467}
