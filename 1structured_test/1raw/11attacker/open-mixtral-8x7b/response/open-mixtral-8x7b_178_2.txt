To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. From Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.345, explanation: This is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified him as black, calculated using Bayes' theorem}.
