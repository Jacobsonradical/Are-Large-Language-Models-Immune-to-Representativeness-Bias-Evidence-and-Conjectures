To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are asked to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is black, so P(W|A) = 0.8

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and white. Using the law of total probability, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') where A' denotes the complementary event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We are given that the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(W|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.195 + 0.1445 = 0.3395

Finally, we can find P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3395 â‰ˆ 0.3472

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the available information is approximately 0.3472.
