To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that a witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is black in the city)

To find P(B), we need to consider all possible scenarios - a witness could identify a black person or a white person as black. So, we need to calculate P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

- P(B|~A) is the probability that a witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
