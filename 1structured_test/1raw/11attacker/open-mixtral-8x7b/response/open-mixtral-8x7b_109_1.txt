To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is black based on city demographics)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%. This is lower than the initial assumption based on city demographics due to the possibility of the witness making an error in identification.
