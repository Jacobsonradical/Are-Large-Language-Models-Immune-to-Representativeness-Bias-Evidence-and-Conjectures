To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are the attacker being black and the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the question, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4536

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4536 or 45.36%.
