Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a random person in the city has a 15% chance of being black.
2. However, the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black does not necessarily mean the identification is correct.
3. Given the conditions, the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the prior probability of a random person being black:
   Probability = (0.80) * (0.15) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.12}
