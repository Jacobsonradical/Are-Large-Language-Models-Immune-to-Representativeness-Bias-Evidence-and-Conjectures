To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black by A and the event that the attacker is actually black by B. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black and when the attacker is actually white:

P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B')
= P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
≈ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 34.5%.
