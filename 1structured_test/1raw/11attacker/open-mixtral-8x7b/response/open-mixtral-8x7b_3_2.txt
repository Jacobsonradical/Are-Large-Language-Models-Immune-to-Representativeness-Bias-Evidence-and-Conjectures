To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To compute P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). Then, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in P(W|A') as the probability of a false positive, when the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases, P(W|A') = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is white, P(A') = 0.85

Now we can compute P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
