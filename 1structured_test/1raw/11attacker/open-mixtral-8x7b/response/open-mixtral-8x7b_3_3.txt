To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's compute P(W|A), the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's compute P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population is black, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's compute P(W), the probability of a witness identifying a random person as black. We need to consider both the case where the person is actually black and the case where the person is white.

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
