To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability of an attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
P(~B) as the probability of an attacker being white, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.

P(W|~B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(W|~B) = 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem,

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Substituting the values,

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.36 or 36%.
