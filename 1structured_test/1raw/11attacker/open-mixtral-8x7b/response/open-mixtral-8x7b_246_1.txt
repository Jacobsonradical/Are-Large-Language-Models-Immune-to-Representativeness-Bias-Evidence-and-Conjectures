Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't adjust our initial probabilities based on the witness's testimony.
4. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only use the city's population statistics to estimate the probability.

Hence, our answer is:
{probability: 0.15}
