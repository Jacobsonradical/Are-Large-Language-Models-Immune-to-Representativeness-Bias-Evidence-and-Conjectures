To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we also need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). Since 85% of the population is white and the witness errs 20% of the time in identifying white people as black, we have P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
≈ 0.43

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.43.
