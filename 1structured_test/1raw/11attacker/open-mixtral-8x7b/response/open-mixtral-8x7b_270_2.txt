To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and that the attacker is white. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A). We are given P(W|A) and P(A), and P(W|not A) can be calculated as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate and 85% white population). Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.17)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.2645) = 0.12 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4534

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4534 or 45.34%.
