To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are looking for P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race. We can calculate this as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A is the complement of A (the attacker is white), and P(W|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. Since the witness identifies a black person as black with an error rate of 20%, we have:

P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Then, P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
