To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, we know P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To compute P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black or white. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black (white) and P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

From the problem, P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability).

Now, we can compute P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
