To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find (the probability that the attacker is black given the information from the witness)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the probability that a witness would identify someone as black given that they are actually black (0.8 in this case)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability that the attacker is black based on the demographics of the city (0.15 in this case)
- P(B) is the probability of observing the evidence, which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying someone as black when they are actually black and when they are actually white (0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.25 + 0.17 = 0.42)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.12 / 0.42 = 0.2857 or 28.57%

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.2857, confidence: 90%}.
