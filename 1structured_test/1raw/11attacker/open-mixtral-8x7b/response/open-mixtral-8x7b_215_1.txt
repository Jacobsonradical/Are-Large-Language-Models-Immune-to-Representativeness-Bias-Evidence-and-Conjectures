To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events (A and B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information:
- The prior probability P(A), i.e., the probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15% black population).
- The conditional probability P(B|A), i.e., the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, is 1.
- The probability of the witness identifying a person as black, P(B), can be calculated as the sum of two conditional probabilities: P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is 0.2 (20% error rate by the witness).
- The probability of the complementary event, P(not B), can be calculated as the sum of two conditional probabilities: P(not B|A) * P(A) + P(not B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(not B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0, and P(not B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), i.e., the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Probability that the attacker is black = {0.1514: roughly 15.14%}
