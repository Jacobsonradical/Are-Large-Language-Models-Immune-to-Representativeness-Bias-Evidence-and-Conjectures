To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are white (P(B|A')) and the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are either white or black (P(B)).

P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
