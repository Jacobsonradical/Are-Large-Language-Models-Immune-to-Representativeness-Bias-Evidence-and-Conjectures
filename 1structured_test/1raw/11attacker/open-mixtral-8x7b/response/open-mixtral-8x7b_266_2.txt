To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the city's population (given in part a).
P(W|B) = probability the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 0.80 based on the witness's ability (given in part b).
P(B|W) = probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is what we want to find.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We have values for P(W|B), P(B), and P(~B) = 1 - P(B). However, we don't have a direct value for P(W|~B). But we can infer it, because if the witness thinks a white person is black, that counts as a mistake, and the witness makes such mistakes 20% of the time.

P(W|~B) = probability the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.20 because the witness errs in 20% of the cases (given in part b).

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [(0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))]
P(B|W) = [0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)]
P(B|W) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
