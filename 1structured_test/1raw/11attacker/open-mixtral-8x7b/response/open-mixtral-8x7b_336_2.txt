To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Pr(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, Pr(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white, Pr(A|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, Pr(A|W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white.

We are given:
- Pr(B) = 0.15
- Pr(W) = 0.85
- Pr(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black)
- Pr(A|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white)

We want to find Pr(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states: Pr(B|A) = Pr(A|B) * Pr(B) / (Pr(A|B) * Pr(B) + Pr(A|W) * Pr(W))

Plugging in the given values, we get:
Pr(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the above expression, we find:
Pr(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.2824 (28.24% chance)

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.2824}
