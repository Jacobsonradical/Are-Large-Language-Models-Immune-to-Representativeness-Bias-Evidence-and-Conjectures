To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event multiplied by the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 and mistakenly identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2. Therefore, the probability of the evidence (B) given the event (A) is 0.8.

From statement b, we know that the prior probability of the event (A) is 0.15, since 15% of the population is black.

We also need to calculate the probability of the evidence (B) regardless of the event (A), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black (0.8*0.15) and the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black (0.2*0.85). This gives us a value of 0.245.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the event (A) given the evidence (B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.245
= 0.48961538461538464

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.48961538461538464}
