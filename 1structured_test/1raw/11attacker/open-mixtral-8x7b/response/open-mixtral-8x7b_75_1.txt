To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which calculates the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some observed evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here,
- P(A): The probability of the attacker being black, which we are trying to find out.
- P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. According to the problem, this is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A'): The probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A). From the problem, this is 0.15 (1-0.85).
- P(B|A'): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white. According to the problem, this is 20% or 0.2.
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. This can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
  = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|A') * P(A')]
  = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.15)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.15)]

Solving for P(A), given that P(A) + P(A') = 1, we get:
P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.03)
P(A) = 0.15 / 0.18
P(A) = 0.8333

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.8333}
