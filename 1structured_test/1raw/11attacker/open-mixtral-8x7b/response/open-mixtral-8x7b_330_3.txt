To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know P(A), the prior probability that a random attacker is black, is 0.15. We also know that P(W|A), the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when identifying black people).

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability that the witness identifies any attacker as black. This involves both correctly identifying black attackers and incorrectly identifying white attackers.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both cases:
- The witness identifies a black attacker as black, which happens with probability P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
- The witness identifies a white attacker as black, which happens with probability P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85, where ~A denotes the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.34

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.34}.
