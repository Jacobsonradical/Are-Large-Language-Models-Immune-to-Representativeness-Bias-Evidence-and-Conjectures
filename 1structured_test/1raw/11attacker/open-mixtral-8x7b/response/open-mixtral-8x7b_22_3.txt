To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. From the given information, we know that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so we want to know the probability of the attacker being black given this information. Let's denote P(B|witness identifies black) as the probability we want to find. We can apply Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(B|witness identifies black) = [P(witness identifies black|B) * P(B)] / P(witness identifies black)

First, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:

P(witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies black|B) * P(B) + P(witness identifies black|W) * P(W)

Now, we are given that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, and the witness erroneously identifies white people as black 20% of the time. So, we can calculate the above probabilities as:

P(witness identifies black|B) = 0.8
P(witness identifies black|W) = 0.2

Now, we substitute these values into the previous equations:

P(witness identifies black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|witness identifies black) = [P(witness identifies black|B) * P(B)] / P(witness identifies black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
