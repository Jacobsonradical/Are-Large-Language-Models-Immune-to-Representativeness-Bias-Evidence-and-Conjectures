To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Denote Pr(B) as the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given. Let Pr(W) be the probability that a random attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Denote Pr(S|B) as the probability of the specific observed evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black, and Pr(S|W) as the probability of the observed evidence given that the attacker is white.

Based on the information given, Pr(S|B) = 0.8 and Pr(S|W) = 0.2 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities Pr(B|S) and Pr(W|S) (the probability that the attacker is black or white given the observed evidence). Bayes' theorem states:

Pr(B|S) = Pr(S|B) * Pr(B) / (Pr(S|B) * Pr(B) + Pr(S|W) * Pr(W))

Plugging in the values, we get:

Pr(B|S) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.517

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the observed evidence is approximately 51.7%.

Answer: {probability: 0.517}
