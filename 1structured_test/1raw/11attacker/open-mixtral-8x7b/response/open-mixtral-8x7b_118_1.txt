To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information: the reliability of the witness and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability of the attacker being black
- P(~B) as the probability of the attacker being white (not black)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black

From the information given, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% black population)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of white identifications)

We need to calculate P(~B), the probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we'll compute P(W), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, regardless of their actual race, which is given by:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can finally calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
