To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. From the given information, we have P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's define T as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We are given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying black people and erroneous 20% of the time. Thus, P(T|B) = 0.8 and P(¬T|B) = 0.2, where ¬T is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as white (not true in this case). Similarly, for white people, the witness is correct 85% of the time and erroneous 15% of the time, so P(T|W) = 0.15 and P(¬T|W) = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(B|T):

P(B|T) = P(T|B) * P(B) / (P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85))
≈ 0.5172

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.5172}.
