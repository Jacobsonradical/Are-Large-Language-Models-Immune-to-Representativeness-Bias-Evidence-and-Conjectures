To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data given, we know P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possible outcomes: the witness identifies a black person correctly as black (P(W|A)*P(A)) or erroneously identifies a white person as black (P(W|not A)*P(not A)) where P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white) and P(W|not A) = 0.2 (20% error rate for white people).

So, P(W) = P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|not A)*P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
