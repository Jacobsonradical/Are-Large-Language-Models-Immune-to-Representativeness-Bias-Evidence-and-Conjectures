Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have any information about the attacker's actual race.
4. The fact that the witness identified the attacker as black does not necessarily make it so, given the possibility of error.
5. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the base rate (population statistics) and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.
P(W|B) is the probability that the witness says "black" given that the attacker is black.
P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness says "black" given that the attacker is not black.
P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.

We're given that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|not B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
