To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability of B given W.

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(B): the probability that the attacker is black = 15% = 0.15
- P(W|B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 80% = 0.8
- P(W|¬B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is white)
- P(¬B): the probability that the attacker is not black = 85% = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B))
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931034482759

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.
