To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
P(W|witness) as the probability that the attacker is white given the witness's statement
P(B|witness) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement

We are asked to find P(B|witness), which can be calculated as:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time and white people 20% of the time:

P(witness|B) = 0.8
P(witness|W) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B|witness):

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
