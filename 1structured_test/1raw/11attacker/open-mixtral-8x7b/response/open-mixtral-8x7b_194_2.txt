To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to the information provided, the population is composed of 85% whites and 15% blacks. Therefore, P(A), the probability of randomly choosing a black person, is 0.15.

The witness identifies the correct race 80% of the time when presented with a black person, so P(B|A) is 0.8. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time, so P(not B|A) is 0.2, and thus P(B'|A) is also 0.2.

Since the attacker was identified as black, we are interested in P(A|B), and by Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

We need to find P(B|A'), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when presented with a white person, P(B'|A') is 0.8, and thus P(B|A') is 0.2.

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we find that:

P(A|B) = 0.36 or 36%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.36 or 36%.
