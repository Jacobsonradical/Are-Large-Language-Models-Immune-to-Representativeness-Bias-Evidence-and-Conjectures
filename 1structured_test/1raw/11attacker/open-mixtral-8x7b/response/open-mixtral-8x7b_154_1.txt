To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black. This is what we are trying to find.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies a random person in the city as black.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of that event conditional on each outcome of another event. Here, we can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and we know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A). To find P(B|not A), imagine the witness randomly selects a person from the city. Since 85% of the population is white, there is an 85% chance that the randomly selected person is white and a 15% chance that they are black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, there is a 20% chance that the witness identifies a white person as black. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17 * (1 - P(A))

Now we have all the components to find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Solving this equation for P(A) (the probability that the attacker is black) given that P(B) (the probability that the witness identifies a random person in the city as black) is 0.85 (since the witness identified the attacker as black), we find:

P(A) = 0.32 or 32%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 32%.

Answer: {probability: 0.32}
