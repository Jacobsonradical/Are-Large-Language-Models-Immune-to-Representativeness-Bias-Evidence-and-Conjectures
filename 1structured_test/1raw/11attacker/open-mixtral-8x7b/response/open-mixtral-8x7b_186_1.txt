The probability that the attacker is black can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. 

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the information given, we have:

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

P(B) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)

To find P(W), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is black (B) and the attacker is white (W'). We have:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W') * P(W')

From the information given, we have:

P(W|W') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

P(W') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

So we can calculate:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.41 (41%).

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
