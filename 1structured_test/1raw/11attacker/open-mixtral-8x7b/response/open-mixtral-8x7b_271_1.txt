To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, and P(H|B) as the probability of the hypothesis given that the attacker is black, and P(H|W) as the probability of the hypothesis given that the attacker is white. Here, the hypothesis H is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that P(H|B) = 0.8 and P(~H|B) = 0.2, and P(H|W) = 0.2 and P(~H|W) = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(B|H) as follows:

P(B|H) = P(H|B) \* P(B) / (P(H|B) \* P(B) + P(H|W) \* P(W))
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
= 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.12}
