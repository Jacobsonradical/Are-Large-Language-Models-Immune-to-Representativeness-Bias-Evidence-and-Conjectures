To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's define event A as the witness identifying the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the witness, P(A|B) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying the attacker as black) and P(A|W) = 0.2 (the probability of mistakenly identifying the attacker as black).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculate the above expression:

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4717

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4717 or 47.17%.
