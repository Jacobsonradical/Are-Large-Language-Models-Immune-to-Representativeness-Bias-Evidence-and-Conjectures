To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B, respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, identifying a non-black person as black)
- P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(A) + P(not A) = 1

We want to find P(A), so let's rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places), "please provide a number between 0 and 1"}
