To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know P(A) which is the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black. This equals the percentage of black people in the city, which is 15%. We also know P(W|A), the probability that the witness identifies a black attacker as black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

However, we do not directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is a mixture of the cases where the true attacker is black and where he is white. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
          = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) and P(A). P(not A) equals 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. We still need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a white attacker as black. This is given as the error rate when identifying white people, which is 20% or 0.2.

Substituting these into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
           = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
