Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistake white people for black or vice versa.
3. Therefore, without further information, the most conservative estimate would be to split the error rate evenly between the two races.
4. So, for each incorrect identification, the witness would misidentify 10% of white people as black and 10% of black people as white.
5. Given that 85% of the population is white, this means that of the 20% of identifications where the witness is wrong, 17% (0.20 * 0.85) will be white people misidentified as black, and 3% (0.20 * 0.15) will be black people misidentified as white.
6. But since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black, we should consider both correct identifications and incorrect ones.
7. Therefore, the total percentage of black people who would be identified as black is 80% (the correct identifications) plus 3% (the incorrect identifications), which equals 83%.

So, {probability: 0.83}. Please note that this estimate assumes equal likelihood of misidentification in both directions, which may not reflect reality.
