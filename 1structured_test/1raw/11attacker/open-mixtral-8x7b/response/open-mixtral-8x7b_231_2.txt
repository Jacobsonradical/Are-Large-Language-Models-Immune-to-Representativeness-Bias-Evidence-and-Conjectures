To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black = 0.15
P(W) = probability of an attacker being white = 0.85
P(W|W) = probability that the witness identifies a white attacker as white = 0.8
P(B|B) = probability that the witness identifies a black attacker as black = 0.8
P(W|B) = probability that the witness identifies a black attacker as white = 0.2
P(B|W) = probability that the witness identifies a white attacker as black = 0.2

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(B|W) * P(W))

We can simplify this expression by noticing that P(W|B) = 1 - P(B|W) and P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) (which is the formula for P(B|W) but with B and W swapped). This simplification gives us:

P(B|W) = P(B) / (P(B) + P(W) * (1 - P(B|W)))

Using the values from above, we have:

P(B|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 * (1 - P(B|W)))

Solving for P(B|W), we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.1339

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.1339}
