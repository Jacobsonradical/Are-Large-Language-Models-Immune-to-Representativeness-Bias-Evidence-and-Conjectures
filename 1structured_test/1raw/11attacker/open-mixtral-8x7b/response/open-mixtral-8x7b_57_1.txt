Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they're more likely to mistakenly call a white person black or vice versa.
3. Given the absence of this information, the most conservative approach would be to assume that errors are equally likely in both directions.
4. This means that when the witness identifies someone as black, there's an 80% chance they're correct and a 20% chance they've made an error.
5. But since we don't know the direction of the error, this 20% error rate applies equally to false black identifications and missed black identifications.
6. Therefore, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 80%, and the probability that they're white is 20% (which is the error rate).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
