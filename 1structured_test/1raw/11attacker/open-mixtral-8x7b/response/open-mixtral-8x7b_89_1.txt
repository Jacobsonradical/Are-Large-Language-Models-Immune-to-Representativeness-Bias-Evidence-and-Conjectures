To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred. This is what we want to find, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that event A has occurred. This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 1 (since if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify him as such).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This is the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to point b.
- P(B) is the probability of event B. This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(B and A) and P(B and not A), or P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Using the given information, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when he is not), and P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.42, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.42.
