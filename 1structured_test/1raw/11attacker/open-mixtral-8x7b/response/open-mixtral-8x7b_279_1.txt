To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know that:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness erroneously identifies the race as black 20% of the time when the person is white, and 15% of the population is white)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85)
P(A|W) ≈ 0.7619

Answer: {probability: 0.7619}
