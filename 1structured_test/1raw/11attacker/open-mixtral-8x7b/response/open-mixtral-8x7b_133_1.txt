To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (or 80%). We also know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which according to the demographics is 0.15 (or 15%).

The tricky part is calculating P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is a bit more complex because it includes two possibilities: the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (event A) and the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (event ~A). 

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (or 85%). 

The value we need to find is P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 (or 20%).

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
