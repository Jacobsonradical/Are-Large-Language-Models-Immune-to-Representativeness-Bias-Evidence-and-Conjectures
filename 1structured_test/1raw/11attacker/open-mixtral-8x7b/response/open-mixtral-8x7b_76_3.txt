To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given)
P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black (which is 85% or 0.85 based on the information given)
P(W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (which is 80% or 0.8 based on the information given)
P(W|~B) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is 20% or 0.2 based on the information given)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.096 / 0.266 â‰ˆ 0.3612

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3612.
