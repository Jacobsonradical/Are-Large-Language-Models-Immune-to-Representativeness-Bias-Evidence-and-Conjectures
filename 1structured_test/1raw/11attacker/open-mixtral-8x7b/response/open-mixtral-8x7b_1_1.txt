To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, event A is the witness identifying the attacker as black, and event B is the attacker actually being black.

First, let's compute P(B), the probability of an arbitrary attacker being black. This is given directly in the prompt as 15% or 0.15.

Next, we need to compute P(A|B), the probability that a black attacker is identified as such by the witness. The prompt tells us that the witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(A|B) = 0.8.

We also need to compute P(A|not B), the probability that a non-black attacker is mistakenly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(A|not B) = 0.2.

Finally, we need to compute P(not B), the probability of an arbitrary attacker not being black. Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)]
P(B|A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|A) = 0.4137931034482759

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
