To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event of the observation (witness identifying the attacker as black).

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is black based on city demographics)

To find P(B), we need to calculate the total probability of the observation, which is the sum of the probabilities of the observation given both possible events A and not-A (denoted as ~A), each multiplied by their respective probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|~A), it is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate). And P(~A) is the probability that a random attacker is white, which is 0.85 (100% - 15%).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.12 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.42857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.43 (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity)}
