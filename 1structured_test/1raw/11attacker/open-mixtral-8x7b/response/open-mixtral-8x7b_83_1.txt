To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85% or 0.85). Let's also denote P(E|B) as the probability of the event E (witness identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black, and P(E|W) as the probability of the event E given that the attacker is white.

From the given information, we have P(E|B) = 1 (the witness always identifies a black person as black), and P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness misidentifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))
= (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.46875}
