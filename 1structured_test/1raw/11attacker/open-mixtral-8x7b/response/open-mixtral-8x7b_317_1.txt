To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a person is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~B) as the probability that a person is not black (white), which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|B) as the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(~W|B) as the probability of misidentifying a black person as white, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(W|~B) as the probability of correctly identifying a white person, which is 50% or 0.5 (since the witness is equally likely to be correct or incorrect).
- P(~W|~B) as the probability of misidentifying a white person as black, which is also 50% or 0.5.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that he was identified as such. By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives approximately 0.187 or 18.7%.

So, after taking into account the reliability of the witness, the probability that the attacker is black is estimated to be 18.7%.
