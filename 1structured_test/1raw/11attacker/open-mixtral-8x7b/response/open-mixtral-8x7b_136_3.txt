To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as white, given that the person is actually white (80% or 0.8).
- P(B|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, given that the person is actually black (80% or 0.8).
- P(Witness|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white, given that the attacker is actually black (20% or 0.2).
- P(Witness|W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white (20% or 0.2).

We want to find P(B|Witness), which is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|Witness) = [P(Witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(Witness|B) * P(B) + P(Witness|W) * P(W)]

We can calculate the terms in the formula:

- P(Witness|B) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03
- P(Witness|W) * P(W) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So,

P(B|Witness) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.17) = 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15

Our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}. This is lower than the prior probability (0.15) because the witness identified the attacker as black, but the witness has a higher error rate (20%) when identifying a black person.
