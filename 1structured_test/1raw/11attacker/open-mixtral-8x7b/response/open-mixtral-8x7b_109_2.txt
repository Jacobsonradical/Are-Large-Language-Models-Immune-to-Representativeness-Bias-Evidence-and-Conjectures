To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define A as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

From the question, we know P(A) which is the prior probability that a randomly selected attacker is black. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

We also know P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

However, we don't directly have P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black under any condition. This is what we need to calculate first.

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
