To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(W|W') as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as white when the attacker is truly white, and P(B|B') as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is truly black. We are given P(W|W') = 0.8 and P(B|B') = 0.2.

We are interested in P(B|W'), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W') = P(W'|B) * P(B) / [P(W'|B) * P(B) + P(W'|W) * P(W)]

We need to find P(W'|W), the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is truly white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have P(W'|W) = 1 - P(W|W') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(B|W') = (0.2 * 0.15) / [(0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)] = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.68) = 0.03 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.0423

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.0423}
