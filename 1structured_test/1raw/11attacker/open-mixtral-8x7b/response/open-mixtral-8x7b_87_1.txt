To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's define A as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are interested in finding P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that the witness correctly identifies black people as black with a probability of 0.8, and incorrectly identifies black people as white with a probability of 0.2. Similarly, the witness correctly identifies white people as white with a probability of 0.8, and incorrectly identifies white people as black with a probability of 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W))

We are given that P(A|B) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.15, and P(W) = 0.85. To find P(A|W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A|W) = P(A and W) / P(W) = P(A|W) * P(W) / P(W) = P(A|W)

So, we need to find the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is:

P(A|W) = 0.2 (probability that the witness errs in identifying a white person as black)

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
