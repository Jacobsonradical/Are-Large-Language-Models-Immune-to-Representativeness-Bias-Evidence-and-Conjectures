To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that a witness identified them as black.

We have the following probabilities:

- P(A): Probability of an attacker being black = 0.15 (from the information provided)
- P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 1 (we assume the witness is always correct in identifying race when it is actually black)
- P(B|¬A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when they are white, which occurs 20% of the time)
- P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (1*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1*0.15) / 0.32 = 0.46875

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.46875}
