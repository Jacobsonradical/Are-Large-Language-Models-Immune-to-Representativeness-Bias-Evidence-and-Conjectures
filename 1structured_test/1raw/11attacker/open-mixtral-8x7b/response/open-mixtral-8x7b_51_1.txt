To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(B|A): probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8.
2. P(B|¬A): probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 20% or 0.2.
3. P(A): prior probability of the attacker being black, which we need to estimate.

Given the city's demographics, we can estimate P(A) as 15% or 0.15.

We can calculate P(¬A), the probability of the attacker being white, as 85% or 0.85. Then, we can calculate P(B|¬A) as the false positive rate, or the probability of identifying someone as black when they are actually white, which is 20%.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.375,}
