To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and ~B represent the event that the attacker is not black (white). We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report.

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 and incorrectly identifies a black person as white with probability 0.2. Similarly, the witness correctly identifies a white person as white with probability 0.8 and incorrectly identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2.

Thus, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is:
P(W|B) = 0.8
P(~W|B) = 0.2

And the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is:
P(W|~B) = 0.2
P(~W|~B) = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36.
