Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a random person in the city has an 85% probability of being white and a 15% probability of being black.
2. The witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy rate for identifying a person's race under these conditions is 80%.
3. This means that when the witness identifies someone as black, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are mistaken (and the person is actually white).
4. Given the witness identification, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black.

Let's calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Where:
- P(B|I) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification
- P(I|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15%)
- P(I|W) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white
- P(W) is the prior probability that the attacker is white (85%)

We have:
- P(I|B) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B) = 0.15
- P(I|W) = 1 - 0.8 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time) = 0.2
- P(W) = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives us:

P(B|I) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.4375 or 43.75%

So, given the information available, there is approximately a 43.75% chance that the attacker is actually black.
