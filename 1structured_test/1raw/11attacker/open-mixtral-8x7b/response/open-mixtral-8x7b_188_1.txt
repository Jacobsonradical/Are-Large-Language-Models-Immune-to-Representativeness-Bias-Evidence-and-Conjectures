To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, P(W|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, and P(not A) as the probability that the attacker is not black.

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black and the witness says so, then the witness is certainly correct), P(W|not A) = 0.2 (20% error rate when identifying a non-black person), and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|W) = 0.46875

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.46875}.
