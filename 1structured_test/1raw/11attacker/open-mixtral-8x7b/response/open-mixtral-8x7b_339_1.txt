To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We're interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given data, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black or the attacker is white. Therefore, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A).

We already know P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Also, since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85. To calculate P(W|not A), we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying white people as black. Therefore, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138}.
