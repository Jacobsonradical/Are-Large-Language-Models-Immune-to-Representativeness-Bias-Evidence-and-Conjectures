To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given the witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the accuracy of the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
2. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black. This is given as 15% or 0.15 for the city.
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This is what we want to find.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
