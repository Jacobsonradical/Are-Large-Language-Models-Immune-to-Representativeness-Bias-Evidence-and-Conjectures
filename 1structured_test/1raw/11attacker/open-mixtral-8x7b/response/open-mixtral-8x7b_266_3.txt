To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and we need to find P(B|A) and P(B|¬A), the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black or not black, respectively.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(¬B|A) = 0.2. Similarly, since there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 and P(¬B|¬A) = 0.9 * 0.5 = 0.45.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.08)
= 0.12 / 0.2
= 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.6}.
