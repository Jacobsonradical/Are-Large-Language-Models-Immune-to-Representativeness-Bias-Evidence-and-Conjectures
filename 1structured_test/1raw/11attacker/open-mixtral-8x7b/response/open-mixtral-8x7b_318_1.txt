Let's reason through the problem:

1. We are given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't know if the witness identified the attacker correctly or not. The information provided is about the witness's overall accuracy in identifying people's races, not their accuracy in this specific case.
4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

So, I will answer the question strictly in the dictionary format as requested:

{probability: unable to estimate with given information}
