Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race, so the witness's identification is our only piece of evidence.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race and errs 20% of the time.
3. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To compute the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 1 (since the witness made the identification).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B|A) * P(A) = (1 * 0.15)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can occur in two ways:
   a. The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identifies them as black.
   b. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identifies them as black.

Event a probability: P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = (1 * 0.15)

Event b probability: Since 85% of the population is white, P(B|not A) (witness identifies a white person as black) = 0.2 (20% error rate).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [(1 * 0.15) / (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculation:

P(A|B) = [0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)] = 0.464285714286

Answer: {probability: 0.4643, the number is rounded to five decimal places}
