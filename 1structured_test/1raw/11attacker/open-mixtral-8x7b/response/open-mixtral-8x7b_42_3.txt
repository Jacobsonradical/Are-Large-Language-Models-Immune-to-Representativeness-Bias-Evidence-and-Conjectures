To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - event that the attacker is black
W - event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data given, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's race. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') where A' denotes the complementary event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(A') = 0.85, P(W|A') = 1-0.20 = 0.8 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Therefore, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.80

Now, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.80 = 0.12 / 0.80 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.
