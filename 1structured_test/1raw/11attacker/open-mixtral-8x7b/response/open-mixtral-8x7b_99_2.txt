To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
P(A): Probability that a person is black = 0.15
P(B|A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 (80% chance of being correct)

However, we don't directly have the probability P(B), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is indeed black and when the attacker is white, weighted by their respective probabilities.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.4138} that the attacker is black.
