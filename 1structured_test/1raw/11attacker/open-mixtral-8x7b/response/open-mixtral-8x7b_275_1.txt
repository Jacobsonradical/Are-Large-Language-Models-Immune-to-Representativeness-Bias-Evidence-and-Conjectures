To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where ¬B is the event that the attacker is not black)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

First, calculate P(¬B), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(W|¬B) * P(¬B):
P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, substitute all these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)] ≈ 0.3158 (31.58%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 31.58%.
