To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
- P(E|B) as the probability of the evidence (witness identification) given that the attacker is black
- P(E|W) as the probability of the evidence (witness identification) given that the attacker is white

First, we'll calculate P(E|B) and P(E|W):

- P(E|B) = Probability of correct identification when the person is actually black = 0.8
- P(E|W) = Probability of erroneous identification when the person is actually white = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / ([0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85])

After calculating, we get:

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 37.5%.
