To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population demographics and the reliability of the witness. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information available.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the attacker being black given the information
- P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics
- P(A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given all possible scenarios

We are given:
P(B) = 15% = 0.15
P(A|B) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

We need to find P(A|not B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (an error by the witness):
P(A|not B) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now calculate P(A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)
P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given the information:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
