To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - attacker is black
W - the attacker was identified as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that they were identified as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people as black 80% of the time). We also know that P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is black, which should be the same as the overall percentage of black people in the city, i.e., 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possibilities, both when the attacker is black and when they are white. Using the law of total probability, we can write:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker being white, and P(W|~A) is the probability of identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2. Also, P(~A) is the probability that a random attacker is white, which should be 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.3571 or 35.71%.
