Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being black is 85%, since that's the proportion of black people in the city.
4. But because of the witness's involvement, we need to adjust our thinking.
5. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, that means there are four possible scenarios:
   a. The attacker is black and the witness is correct (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
   b. The attacker is black and the witness is wrong (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
   c. The attacker is white and the witness is wrong (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
   d. The attacker is white and the witness is correct, which we'll call the "false alarm" rate (0.05 * 0.2 = 0.01)
6. We want to know the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = [P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / P(witness identifies black)
7. The denominator P(witness identifies black) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the four scenarios above: 0.12 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.01 = 0.47
8. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.47 â‰ˆ 0.255

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.255.
