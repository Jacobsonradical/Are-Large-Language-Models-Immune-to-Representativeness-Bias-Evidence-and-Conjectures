To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we don't directly have information about P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. To find P(W|not A), note that the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, so P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.41}
