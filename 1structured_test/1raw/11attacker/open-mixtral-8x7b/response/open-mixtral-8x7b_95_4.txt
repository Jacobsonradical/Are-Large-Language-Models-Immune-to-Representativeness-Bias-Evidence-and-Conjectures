To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the question, we know P(A), the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B|A), the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness, we use the fact that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying black people. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black under the conditions of that night, we use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A), P(A), and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. We need to find P(B|not A), the probability that a white attacker is identified as black by the witness. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying white people as well, P(not B|not A) = 0.8. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.3429 (rounded to four decimal places).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.3429}
