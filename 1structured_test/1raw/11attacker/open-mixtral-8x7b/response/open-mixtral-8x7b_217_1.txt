To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identified the race 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) ≈ 0.43

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.43}
