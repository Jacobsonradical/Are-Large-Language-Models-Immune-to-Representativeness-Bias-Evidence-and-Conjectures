To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (85%). Let's also denote P(E|B) as the probability of the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black (80%), and P(E|W) as the probability of the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (20%). We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the observed event.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / (P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W))

Plugging in our values, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / ((0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85))

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.377

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.377}
