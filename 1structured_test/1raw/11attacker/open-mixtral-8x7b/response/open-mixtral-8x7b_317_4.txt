To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we can express the probability that the attacker is black (H) given the observed evidence (E) as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given:
P(H) = 0.15 (probability that a person is black in the city)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We need to calculate P(E), the probability of the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and ~H)
= P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
