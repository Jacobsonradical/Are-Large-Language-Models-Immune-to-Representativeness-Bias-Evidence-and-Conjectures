To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information given, we know:
P(not A) = 0.85 (1 - proportion of black population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (proportion of black population)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))]

Calculating the above expression yields:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is 37.5%.
