To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black = 0.15 (from the information given)
P(W) = probability the attacker is white = 0.85 (from the information given)

P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the information given)
P(Witness identifies white | Attacker is black) = 0.2 (from the information given)

Now we can calculate:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black) = 
P(Witness identifies black and Attacker is black) / P(Witness identifies black)

The probability of both witness identifying black and attacker being black can be calculated as:
P(Witness identifies black and Attacker is black) = 
P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) =
0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The probability of witness identifying black can be calculated as:
P(Witness identifies black) = 
P(Witness identifies black and Attacker is black) + 
P(Witness identifies black and Attacker is white) =
P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) +
P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white) =
0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified black is:
P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black) =
P(Witness identifies black and Attacker is black) / P(Witness identifies black) =
0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.41, explanation: "Based on the witness's identification and the demographics of the city."}.
