To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (85%).

Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. Based on the information provided, the probability of this event given that the attacker is black (P(E|B)) is 0.8, and the probability of this event given that the attacker is white (P(E|W)) is 0.2 (as the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression:

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.2830

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2830}
