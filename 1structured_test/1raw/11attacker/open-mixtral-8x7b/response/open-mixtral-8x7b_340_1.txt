To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (85% or 0.85)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (20% or 0.2)

We want to calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Now let's calculate the values step by step:

P(W|B) * P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

P(W|~B) * P(~B) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

So,

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Now, let's strictly answer the question in the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
