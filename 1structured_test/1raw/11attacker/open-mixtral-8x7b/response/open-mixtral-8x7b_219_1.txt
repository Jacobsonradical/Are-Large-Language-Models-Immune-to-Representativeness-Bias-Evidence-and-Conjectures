Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the information available, the most logical estimate would be to use the base rates of the city's population.
4. That is, assuming no other information, the probability of an attacker being black would be 15% (based on the city's population).

Here is the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.15}
