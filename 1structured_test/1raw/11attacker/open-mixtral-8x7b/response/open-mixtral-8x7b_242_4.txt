To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
P(~B) = probability of an attacker being white, which is 85% or 0.85
P(W|B) = probability of a witness identifying an attacker as white given they are black, which is 20% or 0.2 (from the complementary probability of the witness's identification rate)
P(W|~B) = probability of a witness identifying an attacker as white given they are white, which is 80% or 0.8 (from the witness's identification rate)
P(B|W) = probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as white

We want to find P(B|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Now, we can compute:

P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03
P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

So,

P(B|W) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.68) = 0.03 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.0423 or 4.23%

However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker is black, not white. Given the information, the probability that the attacker is black is still 0.15. The witness identification only changes the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black correctly.
