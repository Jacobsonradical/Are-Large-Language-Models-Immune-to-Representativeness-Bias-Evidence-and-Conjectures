To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8. We also know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the event conditional on each of the mutually exclusive outcomes. In this case, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A represents the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is white, and P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2. We also know that P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting these values into the equation for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
