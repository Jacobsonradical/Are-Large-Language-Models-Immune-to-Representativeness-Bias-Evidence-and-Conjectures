To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = P(W|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(W|A)) * (1 - P(A))
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)
     = 0.12 + 0.3 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.255
     = 0.375

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375
      = 0.12 / 0.375
      â‰ˆ 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.32.
