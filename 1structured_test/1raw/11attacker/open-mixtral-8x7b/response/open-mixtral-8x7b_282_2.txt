To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, event A is the witness identifying the attacker as black, and event B is the attacker actually being black.

We are given:
P(A|B) = 1 (the witness is certain if the person is black)
P(!A|B) = 0 (the witness never errs to say white when the person is black)
P(B) = 0.15 (population statistics)
P(A|!B) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% when identifying a white person as black)
P(!A|!B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)

What we want to find is P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|!B) * P(!B)]

Substituting the given values:
P(B|A) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(B|A) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(B|A) = 0.46875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.46875}
