To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black as B, and the event of the attacker actually being black as A. Then, we want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(A): the probability of an arbitrary attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%).
2. P(B|A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 1 (100%).
3. P(A'): the probability of an arbitrary attacker being white, which is 0.85 (85%).
4. P(B|A'): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
= [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
