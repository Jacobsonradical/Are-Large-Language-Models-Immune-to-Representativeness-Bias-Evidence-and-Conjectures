To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as black (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability of a randomly chosen person being black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(not A) is the prior probability of a randomly chosen person being non-black, which is 85% or 0.85.

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
