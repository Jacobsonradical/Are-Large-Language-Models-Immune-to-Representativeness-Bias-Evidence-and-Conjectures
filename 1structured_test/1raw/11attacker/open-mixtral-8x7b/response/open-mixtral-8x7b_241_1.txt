To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that B has occurred.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that A has occurred.
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B independently of each other.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability and incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability. Since 85% of the population is white, the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
