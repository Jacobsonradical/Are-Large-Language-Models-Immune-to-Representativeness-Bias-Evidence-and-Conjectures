To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, which is 0.8. We are also given P(A), the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A). 

We are given P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

To find P(B and not A), we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness identifies the attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.345.
