To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the witness identifying the attacker as black and the attacker actually being black.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From statement (a), we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%). 
And P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities that could lead to the witness identifying the attacker as black. This includes both the true attacker being black and the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.3571}
