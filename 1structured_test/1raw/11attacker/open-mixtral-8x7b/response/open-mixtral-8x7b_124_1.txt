To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is black and the witness identified the attacker as black, respectively. Then we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is white, and 85% of the population is white)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.3158}
