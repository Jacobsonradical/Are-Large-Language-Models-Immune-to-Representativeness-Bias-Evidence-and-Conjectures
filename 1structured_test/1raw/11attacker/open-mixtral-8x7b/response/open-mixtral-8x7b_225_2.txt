To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black.
O: The event that the observed evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black) is true.

We want to find P(A|O), the probability that the attacker is black given the observed evidence.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15. We also know that P(O|A), the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker is black, is 1 (since if the attacker is black and the witness says so, the witness is always right in this case).

However, we don't directly know P(O), the overall probability of observing this evidence. But we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(O) = P(O and A) + P(O and not A)
= P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(O|A) and P(A). To calculate P(O|not A), the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker is not black, we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying black people, so they must be correct 80% of the time when identifying white people. Therefore, P(O|not A) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68.

Now we can calculate P(O):
P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|not A) * P(not A)
= 1 * 0.15 + 0.68 * 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.578
= 0.728

Finally, we can calculate P(A|O), the probability that the attacker is black given the observed evidence:
P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)
= 1 * 0.15 / 0.728
â‰ˆ 0.2054

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2054 or 20.54%.
