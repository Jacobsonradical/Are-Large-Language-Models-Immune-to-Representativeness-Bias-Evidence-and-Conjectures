To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there are equal numbers of black and white people, P(B|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1.

Now, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population is black, P(A) = 0.15.

Similarly, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (white). Since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85)

Computing this, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5385

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5385}
