To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = Probability of an attacker being black (15%)
P(W) = Probability of an attacker being white (85%)
P(W|W) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person (80%)
P(B|B) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (80%)
P(W|B) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white (20%)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as white.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W))

First, let's compute the terms:
P(W|B) = 0.2
P(B) = 0.15
P(W|W) = 0.8
P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = (0.2 * 0.15) / ((0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.0595

Now, strictly in the requested dictionary format:

{probability: 0.0595}
