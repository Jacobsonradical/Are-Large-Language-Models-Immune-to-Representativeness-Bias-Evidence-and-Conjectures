To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is black and the witness identified the attacker as black, respectively. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person's race 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From the information provided, we cannot directly calculate P(B|not A), but we can calculate the ratio of white to black population, which is 85/15 = 5.67. Since half of the sample is white and half is black, the probability of choosing a white person is 0.5 * 5.67 = 2.835. The probability of choosing a black person is 0.5.

Now we can find P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 2.835 = 0.567.

Now we can calculate P(B): P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.567 * 0.85 = 0.1878 + 0.4806 = 0.6684.

Now we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.6684 = 0.120 / 0.6684 = 0.1795.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.1795}.
