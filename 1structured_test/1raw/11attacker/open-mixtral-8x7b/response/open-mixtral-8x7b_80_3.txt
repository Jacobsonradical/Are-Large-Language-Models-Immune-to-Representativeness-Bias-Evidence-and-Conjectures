To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we have:
- P(B|A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.80 (from statement b)
- P(A): probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (from statement a)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possible scenarios:
- P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15
- P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 (from statement b, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

Performing the calculation, we get:

{probability: 0.5556, or roughly 56%}
