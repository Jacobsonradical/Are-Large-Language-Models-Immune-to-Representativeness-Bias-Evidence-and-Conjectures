To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).

We also know that P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(1-0.15)
     = 0.12 + 0.16
     = 0.28

Now we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
       = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.28)
       = 0.12 / 0.28
       â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4286}
