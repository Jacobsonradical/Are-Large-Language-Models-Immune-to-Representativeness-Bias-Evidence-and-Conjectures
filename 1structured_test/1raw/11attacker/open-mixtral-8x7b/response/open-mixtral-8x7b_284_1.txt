To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that "the attacker is black" and B be the event that "a witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified him as such.

From the data given, we know that:
- P(B|A) is the probability that a witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of a witness identifying someone as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of correctly identifying a black person as black and incorrectly identifying a white person as black. So, P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.37 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
