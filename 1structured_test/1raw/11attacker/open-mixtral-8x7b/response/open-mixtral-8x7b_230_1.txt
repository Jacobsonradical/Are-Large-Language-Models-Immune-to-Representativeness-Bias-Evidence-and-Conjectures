To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 and erroneously identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2. So, if the attacker is black, the probability that the witness identifies him as black is 0.8. This is P(B|A).

From statement (b), we know that the population is 85% white and 15% black. So, if we select a person at random from the population, the probability that this person is black is 0.15. This is P(A).

The probability of identifying a person as black, P(B), is the sum of the probabilities of identifying a black person as black and identifying a white person as black. That is, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B|not A), note that if the person is white, the witness incorrectly identifies him as black with probability 0.2. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2. And since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the expression for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can finally find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.34 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 1.17.

However, this result does not make sense because the probability must be between 0 and 1. This indicates that there is an error in the problem or in our reasoning. In fact, the error is in the assumption that the attacker must be either black or white. It could be that the attacker's race is not specified or that the attacker is of a different race. Therefore, it is not possible to give a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
