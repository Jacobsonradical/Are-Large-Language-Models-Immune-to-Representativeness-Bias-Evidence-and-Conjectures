To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black".

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white, which is:
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Then, P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
