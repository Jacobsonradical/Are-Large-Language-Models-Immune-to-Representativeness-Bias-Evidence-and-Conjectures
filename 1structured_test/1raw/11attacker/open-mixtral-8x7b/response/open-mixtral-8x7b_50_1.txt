To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and we need to find P(B).

P(B) can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white), and P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 (since if the attacker is white, the witness will always get it wrong, this happens 20% of the time). So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.345, (34.5%)}.
