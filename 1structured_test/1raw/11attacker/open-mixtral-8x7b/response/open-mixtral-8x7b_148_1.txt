Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the city's racial makeup, it's tempting to say that the attacker is more likely to be white. But the witness's reliability throws a wrench into this.
4. Without knowing the direction of the error, we cannot definitively say whether the witness is more likely to misidentify a white person as black or a black person as white.
5. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.

Hence, I will answer the question as follows: {probability: Cannot be determined with the given information}.
