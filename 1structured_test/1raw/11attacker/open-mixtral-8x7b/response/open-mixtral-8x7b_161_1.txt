Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say that the probability of the attacker being black is higher than 15% (the base rate).
4. But given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the posterior probability based on the given data.

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (the base rate of black population in the city)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is actually black (B) or the attacker is white (~B). We are given the probabilities for each case:

P(W|B) = 0.8
P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|~B) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.96 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black only 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.96 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.816
= 0.936

Finally, we can find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.936
â‰ˆ 0.1224

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.1224 or 12.24%. Note that this is the posterior probability based on the given data, but without knowing the direction of the witness's errors, we cannot say for certain that the attacker is more likely to be black than the base rate of 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.1224}
