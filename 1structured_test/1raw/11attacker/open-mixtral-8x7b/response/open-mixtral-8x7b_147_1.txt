Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the information provided, we can only calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, not the actual probability that the attacker is black.
4. The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black is the same as the probability that the attacker is black AND the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, plus the probability that the attacker is white AND the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.
5. Given the base rates of white (85%) and black (15%) populations, and assuming independence between the witness's ability to judge a person's race and the actual race of the attacker, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black person) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness mistakenly identifies white person as black)
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.29}
