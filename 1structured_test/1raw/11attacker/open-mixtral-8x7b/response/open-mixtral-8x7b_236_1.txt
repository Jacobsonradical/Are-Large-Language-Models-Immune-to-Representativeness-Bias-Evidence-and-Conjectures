Let's break down the information given. We know that 15% of the population is black, and a witness has identified the attacker as black. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is indeed black, and multiply it by the prior probability of the attacker being black.

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(witness identifies black correctly) * P(attacker is black)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
