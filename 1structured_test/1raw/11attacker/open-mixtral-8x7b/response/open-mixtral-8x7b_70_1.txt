To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B,
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A,
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, and
- P(B) is the probability of B.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are interested in estimating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of cases where the person was not black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
