To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the city's population)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

To calculate P(B|not A), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white attacker as black, we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

So, P(B) becomes:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
