Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any direct information about the probability of the attacker being black or white based on the victim's observation or other evidence.
3. The city's population statistics (85% white and 15% black) do not directly help us estimate the probability of the attacker's race since the attacker could be from any racial background.
4. Given the information provided, the best estimate we can make is based on the witness's ability to identify race, which is 80% accurate.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
