To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (85% or 0.85)
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (0.8)
P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (0.2)

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36 or 36%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
