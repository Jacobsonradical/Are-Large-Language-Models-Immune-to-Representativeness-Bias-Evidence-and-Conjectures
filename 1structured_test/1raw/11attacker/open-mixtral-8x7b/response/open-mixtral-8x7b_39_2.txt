To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is black and the case where the attacker is white:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(B|not A) * 0.85

We still need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a black person, they are wrong 20% of the time. Therefore, they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

So, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       = 0.345 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.345}
