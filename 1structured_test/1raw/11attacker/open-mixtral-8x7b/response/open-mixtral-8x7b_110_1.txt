To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a black person as black (when the attacker is actually black) and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black (when the attacker is actually white).

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|not A) * 0.85

Now, we need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. We know that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person.

P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35
       = 0.12 / 0.35
       = 0.342857142857

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.3429, the provided number is rounded to four decimal places}
