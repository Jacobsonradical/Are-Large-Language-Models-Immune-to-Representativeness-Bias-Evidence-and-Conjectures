Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they're more likely to mistakenly call a white person black or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say whether the probability of the attacker being black is higher or lower than 15% (the percentage of the population that is black).
4. Therefore, the best estimate we can make is to use the base rate, which is 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
