To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white (~ denotes the complementary event)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, then the witness will always identify him as black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

First, calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.15 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.32

Now, compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
