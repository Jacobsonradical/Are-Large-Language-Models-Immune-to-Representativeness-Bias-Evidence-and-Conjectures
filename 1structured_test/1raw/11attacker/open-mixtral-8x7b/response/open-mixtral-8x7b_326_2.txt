To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the statement, we know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, we assume that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is unbiased and independent of the actual race. This implies that if the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8 and incorrectly identify the attacker as white with a probability of 0.2. So, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Now, to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we need to consider all possible scenarios that lead to this outcome, i.e., both the attacker being black and the attacker being white. Therefore, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A).

From the statement, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race as black with a probability of 0.8 and as white with a probability of 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, we have P(not A) = 0.85 and P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.207.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.207 â‰ˆ 0.579.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.579}
