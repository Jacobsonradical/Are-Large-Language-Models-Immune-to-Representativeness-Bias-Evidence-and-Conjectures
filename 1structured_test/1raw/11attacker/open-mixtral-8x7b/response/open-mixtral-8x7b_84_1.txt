To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which happens 15% of the time)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which happens 80% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, let's compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's compute the denominator of Bayes' theorem:

P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1275 = 0.2475

Finally, let's compute P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2475 ≈ 0.485

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.485 or 48.5%.
