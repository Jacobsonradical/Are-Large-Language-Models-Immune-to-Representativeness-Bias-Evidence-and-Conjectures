To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified him as black.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

We can now calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
≈ 0.4535

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4535}
