To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that "the attacker is black" and B be the event that "a witness identified the attacker as black".

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that a black person is correctly identified as black by the witness)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, based on city population statistics)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the total probability of B occurring, which is the sum of P(B|A)*P(A) and P(B|not A)*P(not A). 

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (since if the person is not black, they must be white, and the error rate for whites is 20%)

So, P(B) = [P(B|A)*P(A)] + [P(B|not A)*P(not A)]
= (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8*0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.345}
