To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so this is 0.8.
- P(A): The proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15.
- P(B|not A): The witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time, so this is 0.2.
- P(not A): The proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
