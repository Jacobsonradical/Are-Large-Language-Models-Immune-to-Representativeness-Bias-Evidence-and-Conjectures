To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified him as such. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
- P(A): the prior probability that a person chosen at random in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(W|A): the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, which is a combination of two cases: identifying a black person as black and identifying a white person as black. Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We know:
- P(W|A): the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8
- P(A): the prior probability that a person chosen at random in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(not A): the prior probability that a person chosen at random in the city is white, which is 85% or 0.85
- P(W|not A): the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2 (the complement of identifying a white person as white)

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
