To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: A witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identification 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is white:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

And we can calculate P(not A|B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white:

P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3158 or 31.58%.
