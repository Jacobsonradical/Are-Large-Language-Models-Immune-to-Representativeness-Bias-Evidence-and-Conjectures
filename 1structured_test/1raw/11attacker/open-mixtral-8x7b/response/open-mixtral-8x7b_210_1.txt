To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15%), P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white (85%), A as the event of being the attacker, and W as the event of being identified as black by the witness.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W))

We are given P(W) = 0.85, P(B) = 0.15, P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black), and P(B|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

Now, we need to compute P(A|B) and P(A|W). Since we do not have any specific information about the attacker other than the witness's identification, the best approach is to assume that the attacker is equally likely to be anyone in the city, regardless of race. In other words, the attacker being black or white does not affect the probability of being the attacker. Thus, we can assume P(A|B) = P(B) and P(A|W) = P(W).

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W))
P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.15 / (0.15 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85)
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.0242

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.0242}
