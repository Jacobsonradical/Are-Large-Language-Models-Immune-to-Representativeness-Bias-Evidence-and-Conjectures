To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white
- P(A) and P(~A) can be derived from the information given in b: P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85.
- P(B|A) and P(B|~A) can be derived from the information given in a: P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identifies the race 100% of the time when the person is black) and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is white).

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
= 1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
= (1 \* 0.15) / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
