To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, we have the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
4. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36.
