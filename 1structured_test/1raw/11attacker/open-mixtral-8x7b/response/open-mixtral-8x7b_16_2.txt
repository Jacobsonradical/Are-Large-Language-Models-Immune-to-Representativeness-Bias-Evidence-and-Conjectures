To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the population proportion of black people)
P(not A) = 0.85 (the population proportion of white people)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.375.
