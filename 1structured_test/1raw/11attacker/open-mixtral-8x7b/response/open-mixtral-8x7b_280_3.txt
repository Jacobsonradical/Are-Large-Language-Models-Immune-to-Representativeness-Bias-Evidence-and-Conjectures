To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black". 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(not B|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as not black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|not A) is not given directly, but we can calculate it as the weighted average of the error rates for white and black people, weighted by their respective population percentages: P(B|not A) = 0.85*0.2 + 0.15*0.2 = 0.2 + 0.03 = 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.23 * 0.85]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1955)
= 0.12 / 0.3155
= 0.3803...

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.38 (38%).
