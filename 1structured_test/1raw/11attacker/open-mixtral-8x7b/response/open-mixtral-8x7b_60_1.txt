To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- P(B) as the probability of a random person in the city being black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(W) as the probability of a random person in the city being white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(A|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|A), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.28302

So our estimate is:

{probability: 0.28302}
