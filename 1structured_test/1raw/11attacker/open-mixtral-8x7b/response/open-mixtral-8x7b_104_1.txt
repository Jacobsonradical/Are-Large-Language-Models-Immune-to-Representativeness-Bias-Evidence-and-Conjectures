To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white. From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(W|I) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as white, given that the person is actually white, and P(B|I) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as black, given that the person is actually black. Similarly, let P(I|W) be the probability that a witness identifies a person as white, given that the person was actually identified as white by the witness, and P(I|B) be the probability that a witness identifies a person as black, given that the person was actually identified as black by the witness.

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the person is black, given that the witness identified the person as black.

From the information given, we know that P(W|I) = 0.2 and P(B|I) = 0.8, because the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying black people.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) / P(I)

We can expand P(I) as follows:

P(I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)

Substituting this back into the equation for P(B|I), we get:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) / (P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W))

We can simplify this expression by noting that P(I|B) = 0.8 and P(I|W) = 0.2, so we get:

P(B|I) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(B|I) = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.12}
