To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement b, we know that 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(B|A), we need the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

To calculate P(B), we need the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for each race: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time for black people and errs in 20% of the cases. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Also, from statement b, we know that 85% of the population is white, so P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.41}
