To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|¬B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

First, calculate P(¬B), the probability that the attacker is not black (white):
P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(W|¬B) * P(¬B):
P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(W|B) * P(B):
P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
