To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black, given no other information. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we have:
P(A) = 0.15

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. According to the given data, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so:
P(B|A) = 0.80

Finally, we need to find P(B). This is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. To find this, we need to consider both cases: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as such, and the attacker is not black and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black. The probability of these two cases is:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), so we just need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). Since 85% of the population is white, 15% are not black, so:
P(not A) = 0.15

Also, the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so:
P(B|not A) = 0.20

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we have all the components to apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
