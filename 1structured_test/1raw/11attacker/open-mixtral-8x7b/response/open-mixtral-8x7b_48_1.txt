Let's analyze the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about which race the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify as black or white.
3. Since we don't have enough information to make an informed decision, a reasonable approach would be to consider both possibilities (witness errs by calling white person black or witness errs by calling black person white) and average the probabilities.
4. If the witness calls a white person black, the overall probability would be 0.85*(0.2) + 0.15*(0.8) = 0.235 (23.5% chance).
5. If the witness calls a black person white, the overall probability would be 0.85*(0.8) + 0.15*(0.2) = 0.755 (75.5% chance).
6. Averaging the two probabilities, we get: (0.235 + 0.755)/2 = 0.495 (49.5%).

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.495}
