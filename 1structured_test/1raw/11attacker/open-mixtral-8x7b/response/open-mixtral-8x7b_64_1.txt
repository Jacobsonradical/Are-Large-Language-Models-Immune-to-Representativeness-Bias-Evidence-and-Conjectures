To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is black.
B: A witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from point b, 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from point a, the witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (from point a, the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, and 20% of 85% is 17% which we approximate as 15% for simplicity)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.13)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.25
P(A|B) = 0.48

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.48}.
