To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability that the attacker is black (to be estimated)
P(W) = probability that the attacker is white = 1 - P(B)
P(W|W) = probability that the witness identifies someone as white given that they are white = 0.8
P(B|B) = probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are black = 0.8
P(W|B) = probability that the witness identifies someone as white given that they are black = 0.2
P(B|W) = probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are white = 0.2

We are given that 15% of the population is black, so P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W). Substituting the values we get:

P(B|W) = 0.2 * 0.15 / (0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.68) = 0.03 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.0423

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.0423}
