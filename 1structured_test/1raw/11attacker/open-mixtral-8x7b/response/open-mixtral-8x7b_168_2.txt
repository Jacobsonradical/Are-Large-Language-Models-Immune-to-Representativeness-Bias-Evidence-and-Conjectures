To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is white)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.44

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.44}
