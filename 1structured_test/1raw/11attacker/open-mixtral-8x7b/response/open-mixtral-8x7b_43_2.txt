Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't know if the witness identified a person as black because they were actually black (true positive) or if they incorrectly identified a white person as black (false positive).
3. We can calculate the probability of both scenarios using the law of total probability.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white.

P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)

The witness identifies someone as black correctly with a probability of 0.8 (80%), and erroneously with a probability of 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white, and P(B|B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

P(B|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
P(B|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|identified as black) = P(identified as black | B) * P(B) / P(identified as black)

We need to calculate P(identified as black):
P(identified as black) = P(identified as black | B) * P(B) + P(identified as black | W) * P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Substituting the values back in:
P(B|identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Answer: {probability: 0.428571428571, "explanation": "This is calculated as the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that they are actually black, divided by the total probability of identifying someone as black."}
