To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, and P(W|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white, given the actual attacker is white, and P(B|Witness) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given the actual attacker is black.

From the information given, we have:
P(B) = 0.15
P(W) = 0.85
P(Witness|B) = 0.2 (1 - 0.80)
P(Witness|W) = 0.8 (0.80)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|Witness) = [P(Witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(Witness|B) * P(B) + P(Witness|W) * P(W)]

Calculating the above expression:
P(B|Witness) = [0.2 * 0.15] / [(0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.0521

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black. Instead, we should calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the actual attacker is white:

P(Witness|W) = 1 - P(Witness|W') = 1 - 0.80 = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(W'|Witness) = [P(Witness|W') * P(W')] / [P(Witness|W') * P(W') + P(Witness|W) * P(W)]

Calculating the above expression:
P(W'|Witness) = [0.8 * 0.85] / [(0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15)] ≈ 0.9737

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.0263 (1 - 0.9737).
