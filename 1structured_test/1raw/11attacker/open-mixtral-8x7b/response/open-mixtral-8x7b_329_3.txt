To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We also need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4535}
