To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(~B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
- P(W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that a witness identifies a white person as black (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Now, we can substitute the values into the equation:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 37.5%.
