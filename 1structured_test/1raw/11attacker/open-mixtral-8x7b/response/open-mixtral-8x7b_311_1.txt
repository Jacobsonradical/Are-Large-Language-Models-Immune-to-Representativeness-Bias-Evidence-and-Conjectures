To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

From the given data, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's race:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(W|A) and P(A). To find P(W|not A), we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black:
P(W|not A) = 0.2

And P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A):
P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Finally, we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.3571}
