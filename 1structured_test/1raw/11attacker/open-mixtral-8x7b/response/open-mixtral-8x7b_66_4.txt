To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white,
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population),
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% white population),
- P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness is always correct when identifying a black person as black), and
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (20% chance of wrongly identifying a white person as black).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

First, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4688 or 46.88%.
