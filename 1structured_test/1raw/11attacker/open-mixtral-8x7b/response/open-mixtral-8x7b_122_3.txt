To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (to be estimated)
P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white (from the city's population)
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as white given that the attacker is black
P(B|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(B) = 0.15
P(W) = 0.85
P(W|B) = 1 - P(B|B) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
P(B|B) = 0.80

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W))

Since P(W|W) = 1, and P(W) = 1 - P(B), we can calculate P(W|W) * P(W):

P(W|W) * P(W) = 1 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.20 * 0.15) / (0.20 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.7125) â‰ˆ 0.03

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.03, which is quite low. This means that given the information about the witness's accuracy and the city's population demographics, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not very strong evidence that the attacker is actually black.
