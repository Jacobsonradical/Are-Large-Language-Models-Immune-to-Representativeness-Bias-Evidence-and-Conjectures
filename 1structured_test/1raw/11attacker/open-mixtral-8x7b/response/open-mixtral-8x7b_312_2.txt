To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's race.

We will use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (E) is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, the hypothesis (H) is "The attacker is black," and the observed evidence (E) is "The witness identified the attacker as black."

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H), which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This is the accuracy of the witness when identifying black people, which is 80%. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Now, we need to calculate P(E|~H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). This is the error rate of the witness when identifying white people, which is 20%. However, since 85% of the population is white, we need to weight this error rate accordingly: P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate P(E), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.1445
P(E) = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4534

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4534 or 45.34%.
