Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being black is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).
4. But since the witness has identified the attacker as black, we need to take into account both the population statistics and the witness's report.

Let's calculate it as a conditional probability P(B|W), where B is "the attacker is black" and W is "the witness identified the attacker as black".

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

We have the following values:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, given the information provided, there is approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is black.
