To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate of black people in the city (15%) and the accuracy of the witness's identification (80%). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

From the problem, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15%) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (80%).

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that he is white, P(B|~A), and the base rate of white people in the city, P(~A) = 0.85 (85%).

P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (20%)

Now we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is 41%.
