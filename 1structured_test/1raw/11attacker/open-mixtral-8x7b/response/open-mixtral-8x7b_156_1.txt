To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
          = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
          = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
          = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
           = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
           â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
