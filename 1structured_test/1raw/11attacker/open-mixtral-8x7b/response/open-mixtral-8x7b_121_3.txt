To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let event A be "the attacker is black" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as black."

First, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (event B), regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (or 29%)

Next, we need to find the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (or 41.38%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
