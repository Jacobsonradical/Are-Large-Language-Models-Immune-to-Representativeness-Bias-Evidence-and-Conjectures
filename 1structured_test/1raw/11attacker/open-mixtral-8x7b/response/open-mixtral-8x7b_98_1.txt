To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let A be the event "the attacker is black" and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as black".

From part (a) of the information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 (80%) and erroneously identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2 (20%). Therefore, the probability that the witness identifies a randomly chosen person as black is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, based on the given information, there is approximately a 34.5% chance that the attacker is black.
