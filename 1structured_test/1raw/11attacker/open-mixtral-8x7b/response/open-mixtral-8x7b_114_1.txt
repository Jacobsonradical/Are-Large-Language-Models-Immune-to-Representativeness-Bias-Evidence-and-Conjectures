To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15).
P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white (which is 85% or 0.85).
P(W | T) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white given that the attacker is truly white (which is 80% or 0.8).
P(B | T) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is truly black (which is 80% or 0.8).
P(T | W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is truly white (which is 20% or 0.2).
P(T | B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is truly black (which is 80% or 0.8).

We want to find P(B | T), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B | T) = P(T | B) * P(B) / (P(T | B) * P(B) + P(T | W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:

P(B | T) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating the above expression will give us:

P(B | T) â‰ˆ 0.378 or 37.8%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.378}
