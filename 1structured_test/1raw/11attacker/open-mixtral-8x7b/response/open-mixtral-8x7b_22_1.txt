To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black).
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white).
- P(W|W') as the probability of identifying a white person as white given the conditions of the night, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).
- P(B|W') as the probability of identifying a black person as white given the conditions of the night, which is 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

Now, we want to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, P(B|W').

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W') = [P(W')|B] * P(B) / [P(W')|B] * P(B) + [P(W')|W] * P(W)

We are given P(W'|B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white) and P(W'|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W') = (0.2 * 0.15) / [(0.2 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.17) = 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the circumstances and the witness's statement, is 0.15 or 15%.
