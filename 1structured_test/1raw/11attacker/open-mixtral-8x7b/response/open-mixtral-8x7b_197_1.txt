To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "The attacker is black" and event B is "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80%. We also know that P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% based on the city's population.

However, calculating P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, is more complex. This would be the sum of two probabilities: the probability of a black person being identified as black (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the probability of a white person being identified as black (P(B|~A) * P(~A)).

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time and identifies a white person as black, and since 85% of the population is white, we have P(B|~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. And P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 100% - 15% = 85%.

So, P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
