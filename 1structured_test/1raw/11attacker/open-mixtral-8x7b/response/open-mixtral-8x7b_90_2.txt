To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. This can be calculated as P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, and since the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2, we have P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, we have P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.38 or 38%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.38}.
