To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness identifies a white person as black. This happens with probability P(W|~B) where ~B denotes not black, i.e., white. Since the population is 85% white and the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying whites, we have P(W|~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.42

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.42}.
