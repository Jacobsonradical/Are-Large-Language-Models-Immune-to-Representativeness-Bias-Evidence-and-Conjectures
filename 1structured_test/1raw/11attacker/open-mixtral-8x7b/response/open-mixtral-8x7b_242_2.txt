To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data given, we know that P(W|A) is the accuracy of the witness identifying a black person under the given conditions, which is 80% or 0.8. We also know that P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(W), we need to consider all possible scenarios that would lead the witness to identify the attacker as black. This includes the case where the attacker is actually black (true positive) and the case where the attacker is white but the witness mistakenly identifies them as black (false positive).

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
