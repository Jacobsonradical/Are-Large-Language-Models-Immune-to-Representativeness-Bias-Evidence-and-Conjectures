To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider all possibilities for B, i.e., both when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white. Thus:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we find:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
