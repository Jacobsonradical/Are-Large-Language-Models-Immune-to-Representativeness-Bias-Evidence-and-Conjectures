To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let's define:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is white)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black

To compute P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
        = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          = 0.4137931

Formatted answer: {probability: 0.41, explanation: "The estimate is approximately 41% that the attacker is black."}
