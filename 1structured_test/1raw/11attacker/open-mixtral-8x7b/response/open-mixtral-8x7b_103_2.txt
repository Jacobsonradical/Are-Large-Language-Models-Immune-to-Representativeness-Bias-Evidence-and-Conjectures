To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability that the attacker is black = 0.15
P(~B) = probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85
P(W|B) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.8
P(W|~B) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem,

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values,

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36 (36%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
