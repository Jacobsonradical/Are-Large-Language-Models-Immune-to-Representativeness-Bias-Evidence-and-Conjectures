To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and we are also given the accuracy of the witness, which can be represented as:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

What we want to find is P(A|W), which can be computed using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [ P(W|A) * P(A) ] / [ P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) ]

First, compute P(W|A) * P(A):
0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, compute P(W|not A) * P(not A):
0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, combine these values to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
