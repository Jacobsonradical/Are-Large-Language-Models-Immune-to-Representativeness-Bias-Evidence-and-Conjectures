Let's first calculate the probability that a random person chosen from the city is black:

P(Black) = 0.15

Given that the witness correctly identified a person' considring race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified him as black:

P(Black | Witness Identified as Black) = [P(Witness Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness Identified as Black)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, P(Witness Identified as Black | Black):
- Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(Witness Identified as Black | Black) = 0.8

Similarly, we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, P(Witness Identified as Black | White):
- Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(Witness Identified as Black | White) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as black:
- P(Witness Identified as Black) = P(Witness Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness Identified as Black | White) * P(White)
- P(Witness Identified as Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified him as black:
- P(Black | Witness Identified as Black) = [P(Witness Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness Identified as Black)
- P(Black | Witness Identified as Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
