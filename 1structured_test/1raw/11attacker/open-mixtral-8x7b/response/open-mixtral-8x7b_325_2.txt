Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the information available, the best we can do is calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the population demographics, which is 15%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15}
