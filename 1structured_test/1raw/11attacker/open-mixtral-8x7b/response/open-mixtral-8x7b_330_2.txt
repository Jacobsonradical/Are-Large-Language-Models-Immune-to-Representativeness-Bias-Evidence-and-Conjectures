Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have enough information about the total number of people the witness identified or the number of black people in those samples.
3. Given the information available, we can only calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as black given that the person is actually black, and the probability of the witness identifying a person as black given that the person is actually white.
4. Using the given data, these probabilities would be 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying a black person) and 0.2 (20% chance of mistakenly identifying a white person as black), respectively.
5. Without further information, we cannot accurately estimate the overall probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification alone.

Therefore, I will answer the question as follows:

{probability: Cannot be determined with the provided information}
