To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider all possible scenarios: the attacker could be either black or white. So, we can write:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
