To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's define the following variables:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black, which is what we want to find.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black, given that the person is black.
- P(~B): The probability that the witness identifies a person as white, given that the person is white.
- P(~A): The probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - P(A).

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(~B|~A) = 0.85 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 85% of the time)

We also know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(~A) = 0.85

We can find P(B) and P(~B) as follows:
- P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
- P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Then, P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.37 = 0.63

Now we can find the probability that the attacker is black:
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
- P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.37 = 0.12 / 0.37 = 0.324324324324

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.324324324324}
