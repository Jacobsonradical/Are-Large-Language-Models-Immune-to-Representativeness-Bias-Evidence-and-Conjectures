To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identifies the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% black population)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
3. P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% white population, where ¬B denotes "the attacker is not black")
4. P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.36

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.36}
