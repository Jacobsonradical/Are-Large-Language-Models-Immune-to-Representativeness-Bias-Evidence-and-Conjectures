Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the lack of this information, the best we can do is give a probability based on the base rates of the city's population.
   - That is, without any other information, the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 15% and white is 85%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15}
