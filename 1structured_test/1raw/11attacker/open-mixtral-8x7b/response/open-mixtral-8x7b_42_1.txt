To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is black and the witness identified the attacker as black, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A), the probability that a person is black in the city, which is 0.15. We are also given P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8.

To calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually black and the case where the attacker is white. That is, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

The probability P(B and A) is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as black, which is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability P(B and not A) is the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies him as black, which is P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.345.
