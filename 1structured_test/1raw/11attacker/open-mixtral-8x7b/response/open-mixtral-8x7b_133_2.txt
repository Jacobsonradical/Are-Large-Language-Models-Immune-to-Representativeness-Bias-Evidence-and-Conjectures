To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events of interest are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We are interested in finding P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
3. P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time, and the probability of choosing a white person by mistake is 85% i.e., 100% - 15%)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B))

Substitute the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.5789

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5789}
