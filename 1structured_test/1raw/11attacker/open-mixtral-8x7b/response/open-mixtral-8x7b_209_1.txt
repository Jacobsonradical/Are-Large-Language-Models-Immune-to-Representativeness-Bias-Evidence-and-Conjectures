To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified someone as black 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white and 15% is black), and we need to find P(B) to proceed.

P(B) can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

To calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white), we can use the complementary probability: P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 (the witness correctly identified someone as white 80% of the time, so they incorrectly identify someone as black 20% of the time when the person is white).

So, P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can finally calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12}.
