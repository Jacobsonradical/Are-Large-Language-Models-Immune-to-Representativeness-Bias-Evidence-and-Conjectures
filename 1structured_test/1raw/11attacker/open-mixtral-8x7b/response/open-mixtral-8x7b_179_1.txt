To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In this case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black". 

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

So, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
