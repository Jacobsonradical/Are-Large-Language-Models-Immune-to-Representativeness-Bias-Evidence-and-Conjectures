To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

According to Bayes' theorem,

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.42

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.42.
