To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B and the event that the witness identified the attacker as black as W. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

We are given:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

First, calculate P(W|~B) * P(~B):
P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
