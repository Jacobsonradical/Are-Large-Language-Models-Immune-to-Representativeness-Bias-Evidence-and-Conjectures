To approach this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a non-black person as black (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating, we get:
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36 (36%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
