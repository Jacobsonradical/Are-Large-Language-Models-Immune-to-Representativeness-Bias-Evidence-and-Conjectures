To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider all possibilities, both when the attacker is black and when he is white:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) * P(A), and we also know:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the attacker is white)
P(W|not A) = 1 - P(not W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
