Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the information available, we can only calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the city's population statistics.

Therefore, without additional information about the direction of the witness's errors, we cannot adjust the probabilities based on the witness's identification. So, our estimate remains the same as the city's population statistics:

{probability: 0.15}

This means that we estimate the probability of the attacker being black to be 15%, the same as the percentage of black people in the city's population.
