To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can express the probability that the attacker is black (H = attacker is black) given the observed information (E = witness identified the attacker as black) as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given:
- P(H) = 15% (from a)
- P(E|H) = 80% (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

To find P(E), we need to calculate the probabilities of the event given both hypotheses and then use the law of total probability.

P(E) = P(E|H=black) * P(H=black) + P(E|H=white) * P(H=white)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
