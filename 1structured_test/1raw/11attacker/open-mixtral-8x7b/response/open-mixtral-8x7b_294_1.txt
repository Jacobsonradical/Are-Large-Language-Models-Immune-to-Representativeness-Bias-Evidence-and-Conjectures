To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events, A and B. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
