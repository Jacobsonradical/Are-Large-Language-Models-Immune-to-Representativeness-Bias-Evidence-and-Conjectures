To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find the probability of observing the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) given the actual race of the attacker. We are given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

- P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8
- P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B | witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies black | B) * P(B) / P(witness identifies black)

We need to find P(witness identifies black):

P(witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies black | B) * P(B) + P(witness identifies black | W) * P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B | witness identifies black):

P(B | witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies black | B) * P(B) / P(witness identifies black)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
