To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information, P(A) = 0.15 and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time). We also need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. This is given as 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time). The population being all white or black is assumed evenly distributed, so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
