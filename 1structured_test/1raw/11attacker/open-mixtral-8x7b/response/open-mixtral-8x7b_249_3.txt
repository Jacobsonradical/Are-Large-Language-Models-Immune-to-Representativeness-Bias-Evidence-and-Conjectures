Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
3. We don't have any information that would lead us to believe the witness is biased towards identifying someone as black or white, so we can assume the error rate is consistent for both races.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black:

0.8 (probability of correctly identifying black person) * 0.15 (proportion of black people in the population) = 0.12

Let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black:

0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying white person) * 0.85 (proportion of white people in the population) = 0.17

The total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black is therefore the sum of these two probabilities:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on this information, is:

{probability: 0.29}
