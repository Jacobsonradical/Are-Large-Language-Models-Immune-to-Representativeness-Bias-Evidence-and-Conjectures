To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the fact that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the data, we know P(W|B) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that he is indeed black) is 1 (since the attacker is confirmed black in this case). 
We also know P(B), the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is either black or white. So, P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

We already know P(W|B) = 1 and P(B) = 0.15. 
For P(W|not B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that he is white, we use the provided information that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. Therefore, P(W|not B) = 0.2 (20% chance of error).
And P(not B), the probability that a random attacker is white, is 0.85 (85%).

So, P(W) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.4688}
