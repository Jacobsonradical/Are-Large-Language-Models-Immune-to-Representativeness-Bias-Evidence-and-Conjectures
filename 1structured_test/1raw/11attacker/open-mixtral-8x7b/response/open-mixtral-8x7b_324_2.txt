Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim couldn't see the attacker's race.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. In the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given the information about the witness's identification. This is a problem of conditional probability.

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want P(B|W), the probability of B given W.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a random person being black in the city)

We need to find P(W), which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W and B) + P(W and not B)
= P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
