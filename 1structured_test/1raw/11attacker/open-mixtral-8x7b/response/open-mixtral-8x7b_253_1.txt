To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event "the attacker is black" and B is the event "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability of the attacker being black. This is what we want to find. We'll start by assigning it a value, say p, which we'll determine later.
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is a combination of two cases - when the suspect is actually black and when the suspect is white but mistakenly identified as black. So, P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
  - P(B|not A): The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. This is given as 20% or 0.2.
  - P(not A): The probability of the attacker being white. Since 15% of the population is black, it follows that 85% of the population is white.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
p = [0.8*p] / {[0.8*p] + [0.2*(1-p)]}

Solving this equation for p gives:
p = 0.25 or 25%

So, given the information, there's a 25% chance that the attacker is black.

Answer: {probability: 0.25}
