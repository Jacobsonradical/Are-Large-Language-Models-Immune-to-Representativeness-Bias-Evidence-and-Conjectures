To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events of interest are the attacker's race and the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, which is 0.8 (80%). We also know that P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). We can write P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We know P(B|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(B|A') as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%). Finally, we know P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.28) = 0.3 / 0.28 = 0.1071

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.1071}.
