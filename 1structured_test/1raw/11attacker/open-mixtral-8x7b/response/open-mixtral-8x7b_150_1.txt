To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black as A, and the event of the attacker actually being black as B. Then we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(¬A|B) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is black, where ¬A denotes the event of the witness not identifying the attacker as black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(A|¬B) = 0.85*0.15 + 0.15*0.8 = 0.195 (the witness identified the race as black when the person is white 15% of the time, and the witness erred in 8% of the cases when the person is white, where ¬B denotes the event of the attacker not being black)

Now we can compute P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B))
where P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.195 * 0.85)) = 0.108 / (0.108 + 0.1653) = 0.3947 or 39.47%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3947}
