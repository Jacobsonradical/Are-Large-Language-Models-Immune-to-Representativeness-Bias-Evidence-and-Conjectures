To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(I|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually black, and P(I|W) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually white. We are given P(I|B) = 1 and P(I|W) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / P(I), where P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W).

First, let's calculate P(I):
P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)
= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Next, let's calculate P(B|I):
P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / P(I)
= (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.46875}
