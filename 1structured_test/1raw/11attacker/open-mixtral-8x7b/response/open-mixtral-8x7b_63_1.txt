To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let event A be "the attacker is black" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as black." We are given information about the probability of B given A (from part a) and the prior probabilities of A and B (from part b).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A):
P(A) = number of black people / (number of white people + number of black people)
= 0.15

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2. Since the witness cannot identify the race of the attacker if they cannot see them, P(B|not A) = P(not B|not A) = 0.5 (chance level).

So,
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.5)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.545)
â‰ˆ 0.216

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.216}
