To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is black and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, the prior probability P(A) is 0.15 (15%). 

The conditional probability P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness when identifying black people, which is 0.8 (80%).

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black when they are actually white, denoted as P(B|not A), is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (20%). The prior probability of not A is 0.85 (85%), so the joint probability P(not A and B) is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17.

Therefore, the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.3158 (rounded to five decimal places)

Therefore, the answer is {probability: 0.3158}. This means that, based on the given information, there is approximately a 31.58% chance that the attacker is black. This is significantly lower than the prior probability of 85%, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the witness's identification.
