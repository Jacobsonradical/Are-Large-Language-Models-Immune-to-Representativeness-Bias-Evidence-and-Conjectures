To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population).
P(W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black (which is 80% or 0.8 based on the witness's ability).
P(~W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as white (which is 20% or 0.2 based on the witness's ability).
P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is white (which is 85% or 0.85 based on the city's population).
P(W|~B) as the probability that a witness identifies a white person as black (which is 20% or 0.2 based on the witness's ability).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

We already know the values for each of these:

P(W|B) = 0.8
P(B) = 0.15
P(W|~B) = 0.2
P(~B) = 0.85

Substituting these values into the formula:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.4138 (rounded to 0.414 when expressed as a percentage)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.
