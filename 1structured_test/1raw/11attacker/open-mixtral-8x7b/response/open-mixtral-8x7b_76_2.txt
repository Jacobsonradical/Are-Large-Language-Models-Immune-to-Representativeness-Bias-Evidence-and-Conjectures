To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): probability of witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) or the attacker is white (A'). Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A').

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. 
P(B|A') is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is given as 20%, or 0.2.
P(A') is the probability of the attacker being white, which is 85%, or 0.85.

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.41.
