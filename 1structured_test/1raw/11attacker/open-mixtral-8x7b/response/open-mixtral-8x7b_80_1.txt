To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness. Let's denote this probability as P(B|W), where B represents the event that the attacker is black and W represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B)*P(B) / P(W)

We know P(B), it's 0.15 (15%) because 15% of the population is black.

To calculate P(W|B), we use the fact that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time. So, P(W|B) = 0.80 (80%).

Calculating P(W), however, is more complex because it involves not only the case where the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as such, but also the case where the attacker is white but the witness mistakenly identifies him as black. The total probability is the sum of these two probabilities.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is black is P(W|B)*P(B) = 0.80*0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is P(W|~B)*P(~B) where ~B represents the event that the attacker is white (1-0.15=0.85), and P(W|~B) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.20 (20%). So, P(W|~B)*P(~B) = 0.20*0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, P(W) = P(W|B)*P(B) + P(W|~B)*P(~B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W) = P(W|B)*P(B) / P(W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.41.
