Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - the witness might be more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black than vice versa, or equally likely to make either mistake.
3. Without this information, we can't adjust our prior probabilities (the base rates of white and black people in the city) based on the error rates.
4. Therefore, the best we can do is to give a weighted average of the two possibilities, weighted by the base rates.
5. So, the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (the base rate of black people in the city) plus 85% times the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
6. But since we don't know the direction of the witness's errors, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is just the overall accuracy rate of the witness, which is 80%.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 15% + 0.85*0.80 = 0.89, or 89%.

However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the witness's errors are symmetric, which we don't actually know. If the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black than vice versa, then the true probability that the attacker is black could be lower than 89%. Conversely, if the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a black person as white, then the true probability could be higher.

So, while we can give a best estimate based on the information provided, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of that estimate. Here's the final answer:

{probability: 0.89, explanation: "This answer assumes that the witness's errors are symmetric, which we don't actually know. The true probability could be higher or lower depending on the direction of the witness's errors."}
