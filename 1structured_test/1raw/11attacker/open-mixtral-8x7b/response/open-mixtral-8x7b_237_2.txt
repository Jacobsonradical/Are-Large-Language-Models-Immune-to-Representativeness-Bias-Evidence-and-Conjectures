Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, it's important to consider both the true positive rate (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) and the false positive rate (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).
3. Given the information provided, the true positive rate is 80% for the witness, but we don't have enough information to directly calculate the false positive rate.
4. However, since the population is either white or black, we can calculate the overall accuracy by considering both the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR), which can be calculated as 1 - the true negative rate (TNR). The formula for overall accuracy is then (TPR + TNR) / 2.
5. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, and assuming that the witness randomly guesses "black" when unsure, the TNR can be calculated as the probability of guessing "black" when the person is actually white, which is 15% / 85% ≈ 0.176. Therefore, TNR ≈ 0.176 and FPR = 1 - TNR ≈ 0.824.
6. Now we can calculate the overall accuracy: (TPR + TNR) / 2 = (0.8 + 0.176) / 2 ≈ 0.988. This means that, considering the racial composition of the city and the witness's abilities, the witness is very accurate overall.
7. However, this overall accuracy doesn't directly help us estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Instead, we need to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that the identified attacker is actually black given that the witness identified them as black.
8. The PPV can be calculated as TPR * (population of blacks) / [TPR * (population of blacks) + FPR * (population of whites)] = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.824) * (0.85)].

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.137}
