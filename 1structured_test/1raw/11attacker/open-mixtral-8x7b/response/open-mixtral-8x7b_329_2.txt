To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the observation of the witness.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is black, based on city population)

However, we also need P(B|not A), the false positive rate, or the probability that the witness identifies someone as black when they are not. Since the witness is 80% accurate, this means they incorrectly identify someone as black 20% of the time. Because 85% of the population is white, this becomes:

P(B|not A) = P(B|white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find our desired probability:

P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) * P(A) ] / [ P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) ]
P(A|B) = [ 0.8 * 0.15 ] / [ ( 0.8 * 0.15 ) + ( 0.17 * 0.85 ) ]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the observation, is approximately 0.43 or 43%.
