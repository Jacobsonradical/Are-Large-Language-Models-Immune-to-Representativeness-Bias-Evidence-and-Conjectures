Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race and that the attack happened at night.
2. The only information we have about the attacker's race comes from the witness.
3. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race and errs 20% of the time.

Given these circumstances, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's report:

P(attacker is black | witness report) = P(witness report | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

We're trying to find P(attacker is black | witness report), so let's express P(witness report | attacker is black) in terms of the given information.

P(witness report | attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a black person)
P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (based on the city's population)

Now, we can calculate the probability:
P(attacker is black | witness report) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
