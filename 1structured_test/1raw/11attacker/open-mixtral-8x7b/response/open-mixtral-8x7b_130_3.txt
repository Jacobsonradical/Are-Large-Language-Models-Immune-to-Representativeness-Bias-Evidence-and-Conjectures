Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say that the probability of the attacker being black has increased based solely on the witness's testimony.
4. The base rate of black people in the city is 15%, which would normally be our prior probability.
5. But given the witness's testimony, while we can't compute a precise posterior probability, we can say that the witness's error could go either way, so the prior probability of 15% still seems relevant.

Therefore, my answer is: {probability: 0.15}
