Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race.
2. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race and found that they correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. However, these statistics are for a controlled situation where the witness is shown a sample of people, half white and half black.
4. In our case, we don't know if the attacker was actually black or white, and the city's demographics don't necessarily reflect the attacker's race since we don't have any direct evidence about the attacker.
5. The witness's ability to identify race in a controlled setting doesn't directly apply to the attacker's race since we don't know if the witness made an error.

Given the information and the uncertainty about the witness's identification, we cannot provide an accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The answer would be purely speculative and not supported by the data provided.

Therefore, I will answer in the requested dictionary format:

{probability: Not applicable}
