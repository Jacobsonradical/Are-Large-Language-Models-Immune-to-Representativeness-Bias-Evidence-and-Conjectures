To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was white, and 15% of the population is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.0255)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.1455
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.8257

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.8257, race: black}. This means that there is approximately an 82.57% chance that the attacker is black.
