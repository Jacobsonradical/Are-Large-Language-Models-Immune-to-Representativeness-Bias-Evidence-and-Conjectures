To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker as black, which is 0.8 (from the problem statement).
P(A): probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (from the problem statement).

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). 

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So,

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
