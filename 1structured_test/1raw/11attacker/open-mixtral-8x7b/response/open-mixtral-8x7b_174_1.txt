To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, to compute P(W), we need to consider both cases: the attacker is black and the attacker is white.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We already know P(W|A) and P(A). We need to find P(W|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is 0.2, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time), and P(¬A), the probability of the attacker being white (which is 0.85, 85% of the population is white).

So, P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can compute P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.0707

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.0707 or 7.07%.
