Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have any information about how often the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.
4. Without this information, we can't calculate the exact probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide an estimate in the requested format. The data given does not allow for a conclusive estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
