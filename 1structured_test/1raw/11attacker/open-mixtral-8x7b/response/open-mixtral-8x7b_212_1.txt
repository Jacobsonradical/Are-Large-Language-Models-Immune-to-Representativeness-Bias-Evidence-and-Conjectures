Let's reason through this:

1. We cannot determine the race of the attacker based on the information about the city's population distribution because the attack happened from behind.
2. However, we do have information about a witness who identified the attacker as black.
3. This witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race and errs 20% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider the two possible scenarios: the attacker is black (B) and the attacker is not black (B'), and calculate the probabilities of observing W in each scenario.

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(W|B') = 1 - P(W|B') = 1 - 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black)

Now, we need to calculate P(B') and P(W|B'):

P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|B') = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black)

Now, let's calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|B') * P(B')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, let's calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
