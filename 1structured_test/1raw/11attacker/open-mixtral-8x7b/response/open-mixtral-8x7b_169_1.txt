To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let event A be the attacker being black, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black person as black)
2. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white person as black)
3. P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being white, from city demographics)

To find P(A), the probability of attacker being black, we can use the fact that the probabilities of all outcomes must add up to 1:
P(A) = 1 - P(not A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.375.
