To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event "the attacker is black" and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of cases not identifying the race correctly)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
