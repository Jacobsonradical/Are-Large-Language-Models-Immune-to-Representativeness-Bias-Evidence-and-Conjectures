To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

From the information provided, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.4855 or 48.55%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4855}.
