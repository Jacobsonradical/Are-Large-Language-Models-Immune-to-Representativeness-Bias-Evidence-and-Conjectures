Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race, so the only information we have about the attacker's race comes from this potentially fallible witness.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race under conditions similar to that night.
3. In the city, 15% of the population is black.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Here, B represents the event that the attacker is black, and ~B represents the event that the attacker is not black. W represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(~W|B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as not black)
P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is not black)

To calculate P(W|~B), we need the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race, they must be incorrect 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white and the witness identifies them as black is:

P(W&~B) = P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can compute P(W|~B) = P(W&~B) / P(~B) = 0.17 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) ≈ 0.4138 (rounded to five decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138} (rounded to five decimal places)
