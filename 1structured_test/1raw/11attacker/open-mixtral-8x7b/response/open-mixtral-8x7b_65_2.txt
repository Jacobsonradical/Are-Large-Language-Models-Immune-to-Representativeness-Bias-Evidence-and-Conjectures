To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
- P(E|B) as the probability of the evidence (witness identified the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black (80% or 0.8)
- P(E|W) as the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is white (20% or 0.2)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / (P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.45

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.45.
