To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the attacker is white
- A: the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given the observation that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

From the problem, we know:
- P(A|B): probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(A|B) = 0.8
- P(B): probability of the attacker being black. Since 15% of the population is black, we assume this is also the probability of the attacker being black, P(B) = 0.15
- P(A|W): probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(A|W) = 0.2
- P(W): probability of the attacker being white. Since 85% of the population is white, we assume this is also the probability of the attacker being white, P(W) = 0.85

Now, we need to find P(A), the probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
