To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
       = 0.12 / 0.2645
       â‰ˆ 0.4537

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4537 or 45.37%.
