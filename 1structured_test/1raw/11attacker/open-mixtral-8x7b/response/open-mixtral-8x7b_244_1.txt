To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black".

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that a person is black) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This happens with a probability of 0.2 (20% chance), and since 85% of the population is white, we have P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we need to find P(B), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying a black person as black and a white person as black: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.207.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.207 â‰ˆ 0.579

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.579 (57.9%).
