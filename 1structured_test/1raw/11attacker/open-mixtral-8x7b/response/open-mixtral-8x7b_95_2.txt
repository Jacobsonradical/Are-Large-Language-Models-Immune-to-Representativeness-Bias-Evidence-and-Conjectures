Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black (a).
3. A witness identified the attacker as black (b), but their ability to judge a person's race is only 80% accurate.
4. This means that even if the attacker was white, there's still a 20% chance that the witness would identify them as black.
5. Since we don't know the attacker's actual race, we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker could be black, or they could be white and mistakenly identified by the witness.
6. To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem: 
   P(Black | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Black) * P(Black) / P(Witness report)
7. P(Witness report | Black) is the accuracy of the witness identifying a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
8. P(Black) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
9. P(Witness report) is the overall probability of the witness report, which can be calculated as: P(Witness report) = P(Witness report | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness report | White) * P(White)
10. P(Witness report | White) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.
11. P(White) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
12. Plugging in the values, we get:
    P(Witness report) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
13. Now, we can calculate P(Black | Witness report):
    P(Black | Witness report) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
