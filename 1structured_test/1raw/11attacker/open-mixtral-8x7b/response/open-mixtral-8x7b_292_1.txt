To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is black and that the attacker is white. Using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So,

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
