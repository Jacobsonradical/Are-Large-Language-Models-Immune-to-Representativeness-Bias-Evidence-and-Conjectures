Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim couldn't see the attacker's race.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. In the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness's accuracy. This is a problem of conditional probability.

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want P(B|W), the probability of B given W. According to Bayes' theorem, this is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We are given P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black), P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black), and we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying anyone (black or white) as black.

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

We are given P(W|B) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.15, and P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85. We need to find P(W|not B), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(W|not B) = 0.2.

So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
