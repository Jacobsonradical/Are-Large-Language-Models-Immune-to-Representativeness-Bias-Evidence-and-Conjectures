To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, we are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities - that the attacker is black or white.
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
