To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events (A and B). In this case, let A be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, and let B be the event that the attacker is black.

We have the following probabilities from the information given:
P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(A|¬B) = 0.15 × 0.15 = 0.0225 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 2.25% of the time when the person was white, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time and 15% of the population is white)

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)], where P(¬B) = 0.85 (the probability that the person is not black or white is not mentioned, but it is assumed to be negligible).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B|A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.0225 * 0.85] ≈ 0.87

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.87 or 87%.
