Let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the error rate being different for black and white people. Therefore, we can assume that the error rate is the same for both races.
3. Given this assumption, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as black when they are actually black, and the probability of the witness identifying someone as black when they are actually white.
   - Probability of correctly identifying black person: 0.8 (80%)
   - Probability of incorrectly identifying white person: 0.2 (20%)
4. Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being black given the information that the witness identified the attacker as black. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem.
5. Let's denote P(B) as the probability of the attacker being black and P(W) as the probability of the attacker being white. We already know these probabilities from the given information: P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
6. Now we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the two cases: the witness correctly identifies a black attacker and the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker.
   - P(Witness identifies black) = P(Correctly identifies black) * P(Black) + P(Incorrectly identifies white) * P(White)
   - P(Witness identifies black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
7. Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black: P(Black | Witness identifies black) = P(Correctly identifies black) * P(Black) / P(Witness identifies black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
