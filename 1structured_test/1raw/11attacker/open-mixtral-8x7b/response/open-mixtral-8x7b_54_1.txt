Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to judge a person's race under similar conditions is only 80% accurate.
4. This means that when presented with a black person, the witness correctly identifies them as black 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
5. We don't have information about how the witness performs when presented with white people, but it's not relevant to our estimation since the attacker was identified as black.
6. So, we can directly use the witness's 80% accuracy rate when identifying black people.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
