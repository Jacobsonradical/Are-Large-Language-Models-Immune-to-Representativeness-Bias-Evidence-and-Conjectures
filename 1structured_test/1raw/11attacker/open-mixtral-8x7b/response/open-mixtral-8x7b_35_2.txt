Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the witness's error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the information available, the best estimate we can make is to use the overall error rate of 20% and assume that this error rate applies equally to both races.
4. This means that, on average, the witness will correctly identify a black person 80% of the time and incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.
5. Given that 85% of the population is white, this would imply that about 17% (20% of 85%) of the time, the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black.
6. Conversely, since 15% of the population is black, the witness would correctly identify a black person as black 12% (80% of 15%) of the time.
7. Adding these two percentages together, we get an estimated probability that the witness's identification is correct, given the known racial breakdown of the city, of 29% (17% + 12%).

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.29}
