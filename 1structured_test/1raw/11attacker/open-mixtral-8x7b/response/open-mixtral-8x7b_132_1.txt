To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(W|A), and we need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(W|not A) = 1 - P(not W|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We are also given P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
