To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is black in the city)

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black, and the attacker is white. Thus:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.15
P(W|¬A) (the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black) can be calculated as the false positive rate, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that a person is white in the city)

Now, we can find P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345.
