To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B). Bayes' theorem is stated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We are given:
P(not A) = 0.85 (1 - 0.15) (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.41 (41%).
