To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to the problem, the total population is 100% divided into 85% white and 15% black. So, P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black, is 0.15.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that he is actually black. This is given as 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that he is not actually black. Since the witness identifies the correct race 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify the race 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness pointing to a black person when the perpetrator is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.31

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.31}.
