To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (the attacker is black) and B (the witness identified the attacker as black).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that a randomly chosen person is white)

We need to find P(B), which is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
