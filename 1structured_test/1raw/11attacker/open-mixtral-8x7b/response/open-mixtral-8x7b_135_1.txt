To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we have the prior probabilities:
P(A) = 15% (from the information given)
P(not A) = 85%

Next, we have the conditional probabilities:
P(B|A) = 80% (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, as given in the information)
P(not B|A) = 20% (the witness erroneously identifies a black person as not black, as given in the information)

Also, we have:
P(B|not A) = 20% (the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black, as given in the information)
P(not B|not A) = 80% (the witness correctly identifies a white person as not black, as given in the information)

Now we can calculate:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we find the posterior probability:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
