To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information given, P(A) = 0.15 (15% probability that the attacker is black) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This happens with a probability of 0.2 (20% chance of error), and since 85% of the population is white, we have P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.427

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.427 (or 42.7%).
