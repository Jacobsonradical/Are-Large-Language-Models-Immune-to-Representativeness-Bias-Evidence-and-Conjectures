To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in finding P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15 based on the information provided in (b).

Next, we need to find P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since we assume the attacker is black, this probability should be 1 (or close to 1 if there's a small chance the attacker might appear non-black due to lighting, etc.). However, for consistency with the rest of Bayes' theorem, we'll leave this as a general probability.

We also need to find P(W|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, and assuming the witness has an equal chance of misidentifying white attackers as black as identifying black attackers as white, we have P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since 85% of the population is white).

Finally, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A). Since 85% of the population is white, we have P(¬A) = 0.85 and P(W) = 0.1 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1485.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
P(A|W) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.1485
P(A|W) ≈ 1.0073

However, probabilities should be between 0 and 1, so we'll interpret this as P(A|W) = 1.0073 ≈ 1.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 1}
