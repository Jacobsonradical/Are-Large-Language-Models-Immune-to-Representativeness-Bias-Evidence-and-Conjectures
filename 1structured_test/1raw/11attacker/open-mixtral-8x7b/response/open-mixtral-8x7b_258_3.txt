Let's break down the given information:
1. We know that the population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

The witness identified the attacker as black, but the witness's accuracy rate is 80%, so we cannot conclude yet that the attacker is indeed black. Instead, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is actually black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies attacker as black) = P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identifies attacker as black)

We want to find P(attacker is black | witness identifies attacker as black), so let's compute the other terms:

P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

P(witness identifies attacker as black) = P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)
                             = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
                             = 0.12 + 0.17
                             = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies attacker as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
