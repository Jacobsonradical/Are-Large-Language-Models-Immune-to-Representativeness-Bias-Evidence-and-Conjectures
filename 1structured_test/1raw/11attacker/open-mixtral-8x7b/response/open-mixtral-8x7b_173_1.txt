To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In our case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(not B) = P(not B|A) * P(A) + P(not B|not A) * P(not A)
= (1-0.8)*0.15 + (1-0.03)*0.85
= 0.03 + 0.741
= 0.771

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03]
= 0.12 / 0.153
= 0.7849056603773585

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.785 or 78.5%.
