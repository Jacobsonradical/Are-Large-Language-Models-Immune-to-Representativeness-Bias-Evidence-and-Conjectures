To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white.

From the given information, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's define E as the event that the witness identifies the race as black. From the given data, the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time and erroneously identifies white people as black 20% of the time. So, P(E|B) = 0.8 and P(E|W) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:
P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.36

So, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
