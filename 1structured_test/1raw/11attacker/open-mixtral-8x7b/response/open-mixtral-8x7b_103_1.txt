To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
H: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(A|H), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|H) = P(H|A) * P(A) / P(H)

From the information provided, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(H|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To find P(H), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. Using the law of total probability, we can write P(H) = P(H|A) * P(A) + P(H|~A) * P(~A), where ~A denotes the complementary event of A (the attacker is not black, i.e., white), and P(H|~A) is the probability of observing H given that ~A occurred.

We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time in identifying a white person as black. Therefore, P(H|~A) = 0.2. Since P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have P(H) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|H) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
