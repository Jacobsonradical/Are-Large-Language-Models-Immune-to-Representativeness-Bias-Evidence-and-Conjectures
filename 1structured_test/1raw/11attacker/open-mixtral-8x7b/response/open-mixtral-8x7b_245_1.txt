To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define our terms:

- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.457

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.457}.
