To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is actually white. Since the witness identifies a person's race correctly 80% of the time, they must identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, we have:

P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3158 (31.58%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 31.58%.
