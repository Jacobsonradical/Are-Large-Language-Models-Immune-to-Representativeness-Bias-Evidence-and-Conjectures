To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
  = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
  = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
  â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
