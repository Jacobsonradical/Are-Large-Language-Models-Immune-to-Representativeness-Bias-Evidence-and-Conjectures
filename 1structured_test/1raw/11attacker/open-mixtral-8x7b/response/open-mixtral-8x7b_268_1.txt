To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and E represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

According to the problem, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(E|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)
P(E|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is white)

We can now calculate P(¬E), the probability that the witness does not identify the attacker as black:

P(¬E) = P(¬E|A) * P(A) + P(¬E|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (1-0.80) * 0.15 + (1-0.20) * 0.85
= 0.03 + 0.68
= 0.71

Now, we can find P(E), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, by subtracting P(¬E) from 1:

P(E) = 1 - P(¬E)
= 1 - 0.71
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / P(E)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
