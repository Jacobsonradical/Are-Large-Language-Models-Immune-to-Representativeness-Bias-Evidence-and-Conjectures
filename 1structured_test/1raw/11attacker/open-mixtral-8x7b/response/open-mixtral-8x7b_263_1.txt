To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is black and that the witness identified the attacker as black, respectively. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker as black, which is 0.8 (from the information provided)
- P(A): probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% from the information provided)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is black and the case where the attacker is white. That is, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). 

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|not A), the probability of identifying a white attacker as black, it's 0.2 (20% from the information provided). And P(not A) is 0.85 (85% from the information provided).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.345}
