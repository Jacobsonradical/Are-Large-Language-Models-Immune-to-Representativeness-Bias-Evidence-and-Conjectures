To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

1. P(W|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

2. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since we don't have any other information that contradicts the city's demographics, we can use the city's population statistics for this. So, P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population).

3. P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of whether the attacker is actually black or white. We can calculate this as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
where ~A is the event that the attacker is white, P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(W|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying white people, P(W|~A) = 0.2.

So, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345.

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
