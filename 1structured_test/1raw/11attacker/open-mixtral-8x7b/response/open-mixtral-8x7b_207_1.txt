To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black),
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time),
3. P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.421

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.421.
