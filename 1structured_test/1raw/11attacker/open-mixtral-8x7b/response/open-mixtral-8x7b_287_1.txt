To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black = 0.15
P(W) = probability of an attacker being white = 0.85

P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)
P(Witness identifies white | Attacker is black) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)

P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)
P(Witness identifies white | Attacker is white) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)

We want to find P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black)

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black) = P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / (P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white))

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies black) â‰ˆ 0.3158 (or 31.58% in percentage format)

Answer: {probability: 0.3158}
