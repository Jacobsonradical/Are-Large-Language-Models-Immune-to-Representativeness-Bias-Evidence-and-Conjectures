To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of cases, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.458

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.458}
