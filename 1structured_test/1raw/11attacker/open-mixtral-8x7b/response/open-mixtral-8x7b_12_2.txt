To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the question, we have the following probabilities:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
