To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event A). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

From the problem, we know:
- P(B): Probability of an attacker being black = 0.15
- P(A|B): Probability of identifying a black attacker as black = 0.8
- We need to find P(A), the probability of identifying anyone as black, which can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying a black person as black and a white person as black: P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(not B) * P(A|not B) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.205

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.585

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.585 or 58.5%.
