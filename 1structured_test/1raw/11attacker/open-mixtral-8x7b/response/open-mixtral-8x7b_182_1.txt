To reason through this problem, we need to use both the prior probability from the city's population distribution and the likelihood from the witness's ability to judge a person's race. This is a classic example of applying Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update probabilities with evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that an attacker is black, which is 15% from the city's population.
- P(W|B) as the likelihood that a witness identifies someone as black given that the person is actually black, which is 80% from the witness's ability.

We want to find: P(B|W), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We have P(W|B) and P(B), but we need to find P(W|~B) and P(~B).

P(~B) is the probability that an attacker is not black, which is 100% - 15% = 85%.

To find P(W|~B), we apply the witness's error rate to the non-black population: 20% of 85% = 17%.

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4535

Answer: {probability: 0.4535}
