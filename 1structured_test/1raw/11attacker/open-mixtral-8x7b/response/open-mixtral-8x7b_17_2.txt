To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is given as 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population statistics. Let's denote P(W) as the prior probability that a random attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now, we need to compute the likelihood of observing the witness's testimony (T) given that the attacker is black (B) and given that the attacker is white (W). The witness identifies the correct race 80% of the time (0.8) and errs 20% of the time (0.2). So,

P(T|B) = 0.8 (the likelihood of observing the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black)

P(T|W) = 0.2 (the likelihood of observing the witness's testimony given that the attacker is white)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(B|T):

P(B|T) = P(T|B) * P(B) / [P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(B|T) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.375, confidence: 0.95}. The confidence level accounts for the uncertainty in the witness's ability to judge a person's race under low-light conditions.
