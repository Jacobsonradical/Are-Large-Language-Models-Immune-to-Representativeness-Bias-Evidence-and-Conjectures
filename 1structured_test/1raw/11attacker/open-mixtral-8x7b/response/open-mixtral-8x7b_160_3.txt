To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's compute P(W|A), the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and assuming that all attacks are either by white or black people, we have:

P(W|A) = 0.8

Next, let's compute P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Given that the city is 15% black, we can use this as our prior probability:

P(A) = 0.15

Now, let's compute P(W), the probability of a witness identifying anyone as black. We can calculate this as the sum of probabilities for identifying a black attacker as black and a white attacker as black:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black (white) and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Also, P(W|~A) is the probability of a witness identifying a white attacker as black, which is the complementary probability of identifying a white attacker as white, i.e., 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases). Thus, we get:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Now, answer the question strictly in the following dictionary format: {probability: 0.345}
