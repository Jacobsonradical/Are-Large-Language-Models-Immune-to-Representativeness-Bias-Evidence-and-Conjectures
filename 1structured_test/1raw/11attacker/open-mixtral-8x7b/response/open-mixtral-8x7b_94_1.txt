To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is black:

P(A) = 0.15

Next, we need to find P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is also 0.8:

P(W|A) = 0.8

Now we need to find P(W|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the population is 85% white, and the witness errs 20% of the time for white people, this probability is:

P(W|¬A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Finally, we need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black. This is simply:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Substituting the values we found:

P(A|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85)

Calculating the above expression gives:

P(A|W) ≈ 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 31.58%.
