To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information: the reliability of the witness (w) and the racial composition of the city (c). We want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

We are given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (the a priori probability that the attacker is black)
P(¬B) = 0.85 (the a priori probability that the attacker is white)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.413793103

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
