Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony.
4. The city's demographics also don't help us directly because we don't know if the distribution of potential attackers mirrors the city's overall racial makeup.

Given the information provided, we cannot make a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, I will answer the question as follows: {probability: "Cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided information"}
