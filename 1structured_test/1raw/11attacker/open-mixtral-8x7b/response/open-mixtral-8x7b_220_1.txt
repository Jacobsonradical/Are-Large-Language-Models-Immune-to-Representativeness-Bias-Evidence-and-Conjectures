To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black (to be estimated)
P(W) = probability the attacker is white = 1 - P(B)
P(W|Witness) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as white
P(B|Witness) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|Witness), and we are given:

P(B) = 0.15
P(W) = 0.85
P(Witness|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(Witness|W) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|Witness) = P(Witness|B) * P(B) / (P(Witness|B) * P(B) + P(Witness|W) * P(W))

First calculate P(Witness|W) = 1 - P(Witness|Witness is white) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Now we can calculate P(B|Witness):

P(B|Witness) = (0.8)*(0.15) / ((0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85))
P(B|Witness) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|Witness) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|Witness) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Now let's convert the result into the requested format:

{probability: 0.4138}
