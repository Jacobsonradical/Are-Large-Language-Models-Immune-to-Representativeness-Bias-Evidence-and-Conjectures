To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(~W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as white, which is 20% or 0.2.
P(~B) as the probability that a random attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(W|~B) as the probability that a witness identifies a white person as black, which we don't have exact information for, but assuming the same error rate, it's 20% or 0.2.

Now, we want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.397 or 39.7%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 39.7%.
