Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Without knowing the direction of the error, we cannot adjust our estimation of the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's testimony.
4. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate would be to rely on the base rates, i.e., the racial composition of the city's population.
5. According to the base rates, 15% of the city's population is black.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15}
