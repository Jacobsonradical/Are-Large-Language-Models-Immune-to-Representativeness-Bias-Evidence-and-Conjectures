To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 according to (b).
- P(~B) is the probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85.
- P(W|B) is the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 according to (a).
- P(W|~B) is the probability that a witness identifies a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 according to (a).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.378

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.378.
