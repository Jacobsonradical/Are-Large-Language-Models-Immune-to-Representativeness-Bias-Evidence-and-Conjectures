To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B, respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". 

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. That is, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We are given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, when the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

Putting it all together, we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
