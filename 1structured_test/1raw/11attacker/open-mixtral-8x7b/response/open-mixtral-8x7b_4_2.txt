To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a person is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|non-B) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black (20% or 0.2, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when distinguishing a white person from a black person)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|non-B) * P(non-B)]

First, calculate P(non-B), the probability that a person is not black (100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85).

Now, we can calculate the denominator of the formula:
P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|non-B) * P(non-B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Next, we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|non-B) * P(non-B)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
