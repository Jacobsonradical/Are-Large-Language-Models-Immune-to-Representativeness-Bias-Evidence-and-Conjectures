To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is not black. Using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
       (witness incorrectly identifies black people as white 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]
       â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36.
