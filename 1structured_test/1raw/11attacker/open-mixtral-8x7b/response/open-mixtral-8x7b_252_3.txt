To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the given data, we know that:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (B) and the attacker is not black (~B, where ~ denotes the opposite of an event). 

So, P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

We already know P(W|B) and P(B). To find P(W|~B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black:

P(W|~B) = 1 - P(~W|~B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

And P(~B), the probability that the attacker is not black, is 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.14 (rounded to two decimal places)

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.14 = 0.879 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.879}
