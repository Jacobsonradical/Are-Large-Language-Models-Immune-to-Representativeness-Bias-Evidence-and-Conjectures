To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the relevant events are "the attacker is black" (A) and "the witness identified the attacker as black" (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know from the problem statement:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black)

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8 and mistakenly identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2. So,
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|not A) = 0.2

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
