To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B without considering each other

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.2 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Without this information, we cannot calculate P(B), and therefore cannot calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black in the requested dictionary format.
