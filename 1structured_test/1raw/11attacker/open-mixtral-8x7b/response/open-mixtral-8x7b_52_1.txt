To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - event that the attacker is black
W - event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying black attackers correctly and white attackers incorrectly:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

So, finally, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black is:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
