To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's compute P(W|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(W|¬A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since 15% of the population is black, it means that 85% of the population is not black (white or of another race). The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can compute P(A): the probability that the attacker is black, which we already know is 0.15 (15%).

Finally, we need to find P(¬A): the probability that the attacker is not black. Since there are only two possibilities, and P(A) = 0.15, it means that P(¬A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we have all the values needed to compute P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values we calculated:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.314

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.314 (31.4%).
