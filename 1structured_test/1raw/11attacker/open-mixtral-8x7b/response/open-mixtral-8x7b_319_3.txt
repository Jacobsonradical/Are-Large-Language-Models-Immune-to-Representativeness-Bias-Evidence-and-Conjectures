To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white),
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black,
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(~A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a white person as black).

Now we can calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

We can calculate P(B and A) as P(B|A) \* P(A) = 1 \* 0.15 = 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible ways the witness could identify the attacker as black: either the attacker is black and the witness is correct, or the attacker is white and the witness errs:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ~A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
= 1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.46875}.
