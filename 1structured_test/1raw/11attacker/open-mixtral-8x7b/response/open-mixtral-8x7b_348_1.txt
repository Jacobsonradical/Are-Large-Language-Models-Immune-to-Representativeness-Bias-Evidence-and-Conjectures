To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = Proportion of black people in the city = 0.15
- P(B|A) = Probability of correctly identifying a black person = 0.8
- P(B|¬A) = Probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.15 (since 1 - 0.85 = 0.15)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5172

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5172}
