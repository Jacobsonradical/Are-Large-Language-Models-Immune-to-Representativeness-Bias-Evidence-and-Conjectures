To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness identifying a black person when the attacker is actually black, which is 80% or 0.8. 

We also know that P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 15% or 0.15 for the city.

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - the attacker is black or the attacker is white. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

Here, P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white, which is the error rate of the witness, 20% or 0.2. And, P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85 for the city.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
