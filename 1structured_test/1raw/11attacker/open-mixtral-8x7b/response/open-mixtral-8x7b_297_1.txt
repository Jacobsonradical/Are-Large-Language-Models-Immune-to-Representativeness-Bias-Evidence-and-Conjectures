To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is black and the witness identified the attacker as black, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4536

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4536}
