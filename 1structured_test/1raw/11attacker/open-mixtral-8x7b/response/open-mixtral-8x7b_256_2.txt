To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability that a random attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

We also know P(W|A), the probability that a black attacker is identified as black by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.

To calculate P(W), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race, we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We need to find P(W|not A), the probability that a white attacker is identified as black by the witness. This is equal to 1 - P(W|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% error rate).

Since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85, and thus,
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
