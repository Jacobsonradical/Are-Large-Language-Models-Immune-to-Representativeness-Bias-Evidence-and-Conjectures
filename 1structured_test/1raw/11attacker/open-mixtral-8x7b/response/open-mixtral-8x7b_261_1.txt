To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identifies the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- B as the event "the attacker is black"
- W as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:

P(B) = 15% = 0.15 (prior probability)
P(W|B) = 80% = 0.8 (probability of identifying correctly that the attacker is black)
P(~B) = 85% = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is not black)
P(~W|~B) = 20% = 0.2 (probability of identifying incorrectly that the attacker is black when they are not)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(~W|~B) * P(~B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
