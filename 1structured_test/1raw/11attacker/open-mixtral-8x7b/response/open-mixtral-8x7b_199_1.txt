To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, the witness is certain to identify them as black)

To find P(B|~A), the false positive rate, we need to use the witness's accuracy rate:
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(~B|~A) using the complement rule:
P(~B|~A) = 1 - P(B|~A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)

We also need P(~A), the probability that the attacker is not black. Since there are only two races in this scenario, we can use the complement rule again:
P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now we can find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.46875}
