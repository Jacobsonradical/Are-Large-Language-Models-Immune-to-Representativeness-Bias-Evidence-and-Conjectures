Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the information provided.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black (a). However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, this information alone does not help us.
3. A witness identified the attacker as black (b). The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race under similar conditions.
4. To calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's information, we need to use the witness's accuracy rate of 80% (0.8).

Therefore, the answer is {probability: 0.8}.
