To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness errs, identifying a white as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4529 (or 45.29% when expressed as a percentage)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4529}
