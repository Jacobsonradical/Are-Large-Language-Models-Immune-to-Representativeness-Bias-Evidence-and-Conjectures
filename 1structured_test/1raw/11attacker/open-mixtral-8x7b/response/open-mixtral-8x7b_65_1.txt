To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem statement, we are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To compute P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is white (A'), and use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

We are given P(W|A) and P(A). To find P(W|A'), we can use the witness's error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability, we have:

P(W|A') = 1 - P(not W|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

And we are given P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white). Plugging these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.8)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.8) = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 15%.
