To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
P(A|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (80% or 0.8)
P(A|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (20% or 0.2)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the observation A (witness identifies the attacker as black):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)]
P(B|A) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.33

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.33 (33%).
