Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of their errors - whether they are more likely to mistakenly call a white person black or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can't definitively say whether the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct or not.
4. Therefore, we can only provide a probability based on the base rates of the city's population.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15, because even though the witness identified the attacker as black, without further information about the reliability of the witness's identification in both directions, we must default to the base rate of 15% black population in the city.}
