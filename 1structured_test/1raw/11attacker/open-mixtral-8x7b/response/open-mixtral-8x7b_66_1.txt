To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random person is black in the city (15% or 0.15)
P(W) as the prior probability that a random person is white in the city (85% or 0.85)
P(E|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (0.8 or 80%)
P(E|W) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black (0.2 or 20%, since the witness confuses black for white in 20% of the cases)

Now, we want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence (the witness identification).

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

P(B|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.3609

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3609 or 36.09%.
