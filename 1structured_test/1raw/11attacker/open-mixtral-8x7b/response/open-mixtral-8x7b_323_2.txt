To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being black, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a black person was identified.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.467 or 46.7%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.467}
