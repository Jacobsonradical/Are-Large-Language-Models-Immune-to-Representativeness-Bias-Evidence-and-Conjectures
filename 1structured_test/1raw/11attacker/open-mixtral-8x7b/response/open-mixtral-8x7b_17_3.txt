To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, Bayes' theorem will help us find the probability that the attacker is black, given the information about the witness's identification.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

From the problem, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(¬W|B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as not black 20% of the time)

However, we don't have information about P(¬B), the probability that the attacker is not black. To find this, we can use the given fact that 85% of the population is white:
P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we also need to find P(W|¬B), the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black. This is given by the false positive rate:
P(W|¬B) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 15% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1275)
= 0.12 / 0.2475
≈ 0.485

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.485}
