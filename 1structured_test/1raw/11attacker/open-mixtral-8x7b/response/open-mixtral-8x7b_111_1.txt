To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.0255
        = 0.1455

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1455
        = 0.096

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.096, 'race': 'black'}. This is relatively low due to the high proportion of white people in the city and the possibility of misidentification by the witness.
