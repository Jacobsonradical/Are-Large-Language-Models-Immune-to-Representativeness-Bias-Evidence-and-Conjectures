To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is black and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. This is given by:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the given information, is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
