To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. This is given as the error rate of the witness:

P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
