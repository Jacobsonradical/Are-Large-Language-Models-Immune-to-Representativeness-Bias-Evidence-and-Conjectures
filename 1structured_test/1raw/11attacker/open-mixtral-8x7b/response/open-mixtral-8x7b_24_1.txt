To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is black and the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(W|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, we can use the complementary probability P(¬W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability). Since 85% of the population is white, we have P(¬A) = 0.85. Therefore:

P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15}
