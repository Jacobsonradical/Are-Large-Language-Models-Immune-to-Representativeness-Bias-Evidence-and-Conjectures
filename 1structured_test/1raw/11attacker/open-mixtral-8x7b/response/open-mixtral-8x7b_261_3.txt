To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, and P(H|B) as the probability of the hypothesis given that the attacker is black, which is the accuracy of the witness when identifying a black person. Similarly, P(H|W) is the accuracy of the witness when identifying a white person.

According to the problem:
P(H|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(H|W) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness erred 20% of the time when the person is white, and 15% of the population is white)

We want to find P(B|H), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|H) = P(H|B) * P(B) / [P(H|B) * P(B) + P(H|W) * P(W)]

Since P(W) = 1 - P(B), and P(B) is the proportion of the black population in the city, which is 15%, we have:

P(B|H) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)]

Performing the calculation, we get:

P(B|H) â‰ˆ 0.5926

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5926}
