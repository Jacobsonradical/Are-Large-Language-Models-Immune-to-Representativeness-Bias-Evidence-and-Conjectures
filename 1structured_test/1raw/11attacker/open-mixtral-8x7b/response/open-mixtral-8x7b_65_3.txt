To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability 0.8)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)

We need to calculate P(W and not A) using the law of total probability:
P(W and not A) = P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies a white person as black in those cases)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

So, P(W and not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.205

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.585

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.585}
