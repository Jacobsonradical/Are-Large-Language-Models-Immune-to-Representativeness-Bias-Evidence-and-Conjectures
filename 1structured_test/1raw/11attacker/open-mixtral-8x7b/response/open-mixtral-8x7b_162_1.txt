To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, which can be obtained from the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population in the city)

Next, we need to find P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8

Now, we need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is equivalent to the false positive rate, and since the witness errs 20% of the time, we have:
P(W|not A) = 0.2

Finally, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black. Since there are only black and white people in the city, we can calculate it as:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, by using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
