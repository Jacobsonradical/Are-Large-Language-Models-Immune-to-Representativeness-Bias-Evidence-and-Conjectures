To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given data, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.17)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.145 = 0.265

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.265 = 0.12 / 0.265 â‰ˆ 0.453

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.453.
