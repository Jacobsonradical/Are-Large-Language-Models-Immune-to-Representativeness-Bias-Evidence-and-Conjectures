To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. 

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is black
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%).

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for two mutually exclusive events: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as such, and the attacker is not black (white) and the witness incorrectly identifies him as black.

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) * P(A), so we need to calculate P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%). And P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values in, we get:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
