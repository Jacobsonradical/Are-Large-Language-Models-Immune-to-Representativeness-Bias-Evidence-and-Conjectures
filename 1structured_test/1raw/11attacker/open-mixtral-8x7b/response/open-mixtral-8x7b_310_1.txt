To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given).
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (which is 80% or 0.8 based on the information given).
P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is 15% or 0.15, since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is white, and white people make up 85% of the population).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1275)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.2475
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.485 (48.5%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 48.5%.
