To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - event that the attacker is black
W - event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

However, to calculate P(W), we also need to consider the case where the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies him as black, which happens with a probability of P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Then, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.467.

Answer: {probability: 0.467}
