Let's analyze the problem:

1. We cannot determine the exact race of the attacker based on the given information.
2. However, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement and the racial composition of the city.
3. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. In this city, 15% of the population is black.

Let B be the event that the attacker is actually black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities for the attacker's race: black or white. We can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

We know P(W|B) and P(B). For P(W|~B), the witness identifies a white person as black, which happens 20% of the time:

P(W|~B) = 0.2
P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

Now calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate is:
{probability: 0.345}
