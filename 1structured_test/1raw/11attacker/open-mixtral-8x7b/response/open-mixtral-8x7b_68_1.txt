To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 80%)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 20%)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person chosen at random from the city is black is 15%)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that a person chosen at random from the city is white is 85%)

We also need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
