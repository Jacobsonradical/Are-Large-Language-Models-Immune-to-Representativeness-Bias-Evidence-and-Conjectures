Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To find the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification, we need to account for both the population demographics and the witness's accuracy.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We already know P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. To find P(W), we need to calculate the probabilities for the two possible scenarios: the attacker is black, and the attacker is not black (white).

Scenario 1: The attacker is black
P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% population is black)

Scenario 2: The attacker is not black (white)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.245 (witness errs in identifying the attacker as black)
P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% population is white)

Now, calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.245 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2835

Finally, calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2835 ≈ 0.3526

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is around 0.3526 or 35.26%.
