To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, the population is split 85-15 between white and black people. So, P(A), the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black, is 15%.

The witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, is 80%. Similarly, P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), is 20% because the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies a white person as black.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the denominator:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate the numerator:

P(B|A) * P(A)
= (0.80 * 0.15)
= 0.12

Finally, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
