To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information: the witness's ability to identify a person's race and the racial distribution in the city.

Let's define:
- P(B) as the probability of the attacker being black, which is what we want to estimate.
- P(~B) as the probability of the attacker being white, where ~B denotes "not B".
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (80% from the given information).
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white (20% from the given information).
- P(B') as the probability of the attacker being black in the city, which is 15%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

From the given information, P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|~B) = 0.2, and P(~B) = 0.85 (100% - 15%). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * P(B)) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We don't know P(B), but we can solve for it:

P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
P(B) = (0.8 * P(B)) / ((0.8 * P(B)) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Now, we can plug in the racial distribution of the city, P(B') = 0.15, and solve for P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * P(B)) / ((0.8 * P(B)) + (0.2 * 0.85))
0.15 = (0.8 * P(B)) / ((0.8 * P(B)) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) â‰ˆ 0.2273

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2273}
