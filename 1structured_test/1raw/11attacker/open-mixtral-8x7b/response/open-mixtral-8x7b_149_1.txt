To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A), we have P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

To find P(B|not A), we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.345}
