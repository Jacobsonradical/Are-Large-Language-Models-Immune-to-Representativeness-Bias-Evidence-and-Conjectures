To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 1 (since the attacker is definitely black in this case).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% from the city's population).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A).
  - P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
  - P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85% from the city's population).

So, P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.46875}
