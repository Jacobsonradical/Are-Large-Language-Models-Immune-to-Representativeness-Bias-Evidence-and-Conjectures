To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information: the reliability of the witness and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
3. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white, where ¬A denotes "the attacker is white")
4. P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability)

Now we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
