To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is black
W = Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

To calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black (white), we use P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Then, we calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)
P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
