Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race, so the only information we have about the attacker's race comes from this potentially fallible witness.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white (P(B|not A) * P(not A)).

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white, based on the city's population)

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white. This is the complement of the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white when the attacker is actually white, which is given as 20% (or 0.2). Therefore, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(B):
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
- P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
