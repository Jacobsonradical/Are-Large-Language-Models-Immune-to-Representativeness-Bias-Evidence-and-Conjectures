To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities:

1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% from the city's population).
2. P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80% from the witness's ability).
3. P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20% from the witness's ability).
4. P(¬A): The prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85% from the city's population).

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) ≈ 0.2 + 0.17
P(B) ≈ 0.37

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.37
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3}
