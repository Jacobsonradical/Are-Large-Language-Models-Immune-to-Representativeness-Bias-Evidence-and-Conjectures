To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (85% or 0.85)
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (80% or 0.8)
P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plug in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41, explanation: "This estimate is based on the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the city."}
