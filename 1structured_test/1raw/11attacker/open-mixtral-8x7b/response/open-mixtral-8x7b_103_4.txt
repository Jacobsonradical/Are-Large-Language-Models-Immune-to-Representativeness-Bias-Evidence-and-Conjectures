Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to conclude that the attacker is more likely to be white. But the provided information about the witness's abilities doesn't allow us to make a definitive conclusion.
4. The information about the witness's ability to judge a person's race only becomes relevant if we knew that the witness identified the attacker as black, which we do.
5. However, even with this information, we can't calculate the exact probability because we don't know the direction of the witness's errors.

Therefore, based on the given information, it's not possible to provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. The answer is:

{probability: "Cannot be determined with certainty"}
