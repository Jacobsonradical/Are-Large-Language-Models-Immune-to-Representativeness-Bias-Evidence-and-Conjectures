Let's reason through this:

1. We cannot determine the race of the attacker based on the given information about the population distribution because the attack happened from behind.
2. However, we do have information about a witness who correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. The key question is: Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, what is the probability that the attacker is actually black?
4. This is a problem of conditional probability. We want P(attacker is black | witness identified as black), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identified as black)
6. We are given P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person)
   And we are given P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (prior probability based on city population)
7. To find P(witness identified as black), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:
   P(witness identified as black) = P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identified as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)
   Here, P(witness identified as black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black) and P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (based on city population)
8. Therefore, P(witness identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
9. Now we can calculate the desired conditional probability:
   P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
