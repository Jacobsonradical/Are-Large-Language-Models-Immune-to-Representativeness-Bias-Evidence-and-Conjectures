To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = The probability that the attacker is black (which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given)
P(~B) = The probability that the attacker is not black (which is 85% or 0.85 based on the information given)
P(W|B) = The probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (which is 80% or 0.8 based on the information given)
P(W|~B) = The probability that a witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is 20% or 0.2 based on the information given)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) = 0.413793103 ("approximately" 0.41)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.41.
