Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on this information.

The witness identified the attacker as black, but we cannot be 100% sure because the witness could have erred. Since we don't have any evidence suggesting the witness's error rate specifically for black people, we will assume that the error rate applies equally to both races.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black:
- Probability of the attacker being black = 15% = 0.15
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying the race = 80% = 0.8

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is the product of the above two probabilities:
0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:
- Probability of the attacker being white = 85% = 0.85
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the race = 20% = 0.2

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is the product of the above two probabilities:
0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The final estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities calculated above:
0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.29

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
