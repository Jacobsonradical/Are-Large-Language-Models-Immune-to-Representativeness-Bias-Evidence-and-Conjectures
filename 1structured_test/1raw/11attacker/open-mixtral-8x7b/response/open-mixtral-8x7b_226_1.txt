To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, and P(W) as the probability that a random person in the city is white. From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Let's denote P(C|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, and P(C|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white. From the information given, P(C|B) = 0.8 and P(C|W) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / [P(C|B) * P(B) + P(C|W) * P(W)]. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|C) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
