To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 15% (from the information given)
P(W|A) = 80% (the probability of correctly identifying a black person, as given)

However, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
         = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85  (since P(not A) = 1 - P(A))
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
           = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
           = 0.12 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, given the information, there is approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is black.
