To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (85% or 0.85)
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (80% or 0.8)
P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

First, calculate the terms in the formula:
P(W|B) * P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(W|~B) * P(~B) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now, calculate the denominator:
P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.41, or 41%}.
