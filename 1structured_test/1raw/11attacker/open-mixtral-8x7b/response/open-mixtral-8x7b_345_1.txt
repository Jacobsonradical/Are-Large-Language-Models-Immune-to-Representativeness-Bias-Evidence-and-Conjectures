Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the witness's errors - whether they are more likely to mistake white people for black or vice versa.
3. Therefore, we can only use the overall accuracy of the witness to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.
4. Since 85% of the city's population is white, it might be tempting to assume that the attacker is more likely to be white. But this fact alone does not give us enough information to make that determination without considering the witness's report.
5. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and their estimated accuracy is 80%, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black as 0.8 (or 80%).

So, {probability: 0.8}
