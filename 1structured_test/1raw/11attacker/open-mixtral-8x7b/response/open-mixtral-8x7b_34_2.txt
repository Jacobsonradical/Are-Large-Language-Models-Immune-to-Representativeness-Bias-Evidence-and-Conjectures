To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.85 - 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.23 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.23 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.304

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.304}
