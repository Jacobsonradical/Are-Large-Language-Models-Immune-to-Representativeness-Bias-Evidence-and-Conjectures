To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
Then we can calculate P(W and ¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

However, since we are asked to provide an estimate as a number between 0 and 1, we can say that the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
