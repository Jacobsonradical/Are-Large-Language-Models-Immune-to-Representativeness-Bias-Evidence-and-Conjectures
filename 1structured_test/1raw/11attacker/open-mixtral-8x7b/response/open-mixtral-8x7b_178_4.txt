Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Without this information, we can only calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct based on the city's racial makeup.

Let's calculate:

P(B | Witness identifies black) = P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identifies black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the given information, is:

{probability: 0.29}
