To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15), and P(W) as the probability that a random person is white (85% or 0.85). Let's also denote P(O|B) as the probability of observing the given evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is black, and P(O|W) as the probability of observing the given evidence given that the attacker is white.

We want to find P(B|O), the probability that the attacker is black given the observed evidence. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|O) = P(O|B) * P(B) / (P(O|B) * P(B) + P(O|W) * P(W))

We are given P(B) and P(W), and we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, regardless of whether the attacker is actually black or white. We can calculate P(O|B) as the accuracy of the witness when identifying black people, which is 80% or 0.8. Similarly, we can calculate P(O|W) as the error rate of the witness when identifying black people, which is 20% or 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|O) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(B|O) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
