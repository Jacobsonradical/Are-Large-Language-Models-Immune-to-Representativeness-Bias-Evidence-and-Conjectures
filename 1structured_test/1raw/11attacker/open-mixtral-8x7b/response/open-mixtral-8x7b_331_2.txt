To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(W|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, which is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black. This is given as 20% or 0.2.

To find this, we also need to know P(not A), the probability of the attacker being white, which is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black, so 85% is white).

Then, P(not A|W), the probability of the attacker being white given the witness identified the attacker as black, is the probability that the witness makes a mistake, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.41379310344827587

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
