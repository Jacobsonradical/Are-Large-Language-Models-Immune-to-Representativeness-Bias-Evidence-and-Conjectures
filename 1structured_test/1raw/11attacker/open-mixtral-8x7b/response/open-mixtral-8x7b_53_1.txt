To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black (given in part b), which is 15%.
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white, which is 85%.
- P(W|witness) as the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification (part a), and
- P(B|witness) as the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

We are looking for P(B|witness). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / (P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W))

We're given P(B) = 0.15, and P(W) = 0.85. We need to find P(witness|B) and P(witness|W).

The witness correctly identifies black people as black with a probability of 80% and identifies black people as white with a probability of 20%. So, P(witness|B) = 0.8 and P(witness|W) = 0.2 (mistakenly identifying a white person as black).

Now, let's calculate P(B|witness):

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(B|witness) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|witness) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|witness) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
