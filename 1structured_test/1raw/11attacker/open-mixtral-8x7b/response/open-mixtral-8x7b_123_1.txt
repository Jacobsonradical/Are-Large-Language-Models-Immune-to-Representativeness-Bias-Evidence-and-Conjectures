Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of these errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Therefore, to be conservative, we can assume that errors are equally likely in both directions. This means that if the witness identifies someone as black, there's a 20% chance they are actually white (and were mistaken for black) and an 80% chance they are indeed black.
4. Given the base rates in the city (85% white, 15% black), this translates into the following probabilities:
   - If the attacker is white, there's a 0.85 probability they'll be misidentified as black by the witness, and a 0.15 probability they'll be correctly identified as white.
   - If the attacker is black, there's a 0.15 probability they'll be misidentified as white by the witness, and a 0.85 probability they'll be correctly identified as black.
5. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
   - P(Attacker is black | Witness identified black) = [P(Witness identified black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / P(Witness identified black)
   - P(Witness identified black) is the sum of probabilities for all scenarios where the witness identifies the attacker as black, i.e., when the attacker is actually black and when they are mistakenly identified as black while being white.

Calculating this gives us:
- P(Attacker is black | Witness identified black) â‰ˆ 0.57 (57%)

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.57}
