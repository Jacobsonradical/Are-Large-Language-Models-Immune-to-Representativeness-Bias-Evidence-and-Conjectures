To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are asked to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.4537 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4537}
