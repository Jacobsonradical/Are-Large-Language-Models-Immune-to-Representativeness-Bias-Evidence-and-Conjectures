To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We're looking for P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities given in the problem:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4% when expressed as a percentage).
