To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability of an attacker being black (15%)
P(W) = probability of an attacker being white (85%)
P(W|W) = probability of witness correctly identifying a white person (100% - 20% = 80%)
P(B|B) = probability of witness correctly identifying a black person (100% - 20% = 80%)
P(W|B) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white (20%)
P(B|W) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20%)

We want to find P(B|A), the probability of an attacker being black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We have P(B) and P(W), so we need to find P(A|B) and P(A).

P(A|B) = P(W identifies black | attacker is black) = P(B|B) = 80% = 0.8

P(A|W) = P(W identifies black | attacker is white) = P(W|B) = 20% = 0.2

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we can find P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.343}
