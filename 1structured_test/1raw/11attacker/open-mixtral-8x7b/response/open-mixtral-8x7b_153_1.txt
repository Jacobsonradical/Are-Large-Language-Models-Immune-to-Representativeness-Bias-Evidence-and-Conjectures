Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race, so the only information about the attacker's race comes from the witness.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. In the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify a random person in the city as black, regardless of the person's actual race. If we take a random person from the city, there's an 85% chance they are white and a 15% chance they are black. The witness will correctly identify a black person as black 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

So, the overall probability that the witness would identify a person as black is:
P(identified black) = P(white)*P(identify black | white) + P(black)*P(identify black | black)
= 0.85*0.2 + 0.15*0.8
= 0.17 + 0.12
= 0.29

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.29}
