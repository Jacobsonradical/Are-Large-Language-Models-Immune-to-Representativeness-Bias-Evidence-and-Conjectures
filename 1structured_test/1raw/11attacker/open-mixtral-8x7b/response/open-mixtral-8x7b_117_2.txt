To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
3. P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability, and 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate the denominator:
P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Then, calculate the numerator:
P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.2645 ≈ 0.4537

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4537}
