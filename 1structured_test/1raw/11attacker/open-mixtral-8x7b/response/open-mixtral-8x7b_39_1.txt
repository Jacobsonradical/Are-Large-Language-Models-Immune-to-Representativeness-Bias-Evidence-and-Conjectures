To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85%).
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is 1, since if the attacker is indeed black, the witness would correctly identify them as black.
- P(W|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is 0.2 (20%), since the witness erroneously identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is not black.

We want to calculate:
P(A|W) = P(W and A) / P(W)

Using the definition of conditional probability:
P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15

Calculating P(W):
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and ~A) = 0.15 + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So,
P(A|W) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 46.88%.
