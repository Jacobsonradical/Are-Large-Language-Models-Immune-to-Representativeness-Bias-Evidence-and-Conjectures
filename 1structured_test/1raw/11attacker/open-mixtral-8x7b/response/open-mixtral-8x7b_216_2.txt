To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's calculate P(W|A), the probability of observing the witness identification given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, this probability equals 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black. According to the problem statement, 15% of the population is black, so this probability equals 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: observing the witness identification when the attacker is black and observing it when the attacker is white. This results in:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A denotes the complementary event that the attacker is white, and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(W|~A), the probability of observing the witness identification when the attacker is white, we need to consider the witness's error rate when identifying a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability equals 0.2.

Substituting all of the above values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
