Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the witness's accuracy when the person is not facing them (as in this case, the attacker approached from behind).
3. So, we cannot directly use the given statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, the best estimate we can give is based on the general population of the city:

{probability: 0.15}

This answer reflects the base rate of black people in the city, given that we have no other information about the attacker.
