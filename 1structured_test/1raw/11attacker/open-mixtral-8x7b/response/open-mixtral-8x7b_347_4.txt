To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is black
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(W|A), the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black, we use the witness's ability to judge a person's race. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so P(W|A) = 0.8.

To find P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as black, we need to consider both correct identifications of black people and incorrect identifications of white people. This involves multiplying the probabilities of each event and summing them up:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
