To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote "B" as the event that the attacker is black, and "W" as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
where ¬B denotes the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
≈ 0.345

However, this answer is not in the desired format. Therefore, we will convert it to a percentage:
0.345 * 100 ≈ 34.5%

Answer: {probability: 0.345, explanation: "The estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 34.5%"}
