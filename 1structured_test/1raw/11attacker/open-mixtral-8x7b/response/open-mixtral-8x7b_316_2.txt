To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white. Using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. We still need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This is the error rate for the witness identifying a white person as black, so P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% of the time).

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.343.
