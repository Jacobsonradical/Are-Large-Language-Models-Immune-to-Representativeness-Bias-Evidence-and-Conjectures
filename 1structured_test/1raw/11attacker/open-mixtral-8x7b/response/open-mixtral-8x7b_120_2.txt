To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white, where ¬A denotes the attacker is not black)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.205

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.205 ≈ 0.5853

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.5853}
