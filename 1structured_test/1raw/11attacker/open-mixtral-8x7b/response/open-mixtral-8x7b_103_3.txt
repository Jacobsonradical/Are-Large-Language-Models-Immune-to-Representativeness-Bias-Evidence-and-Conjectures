To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
P(W) as the prior probability that a person in the city is white (85% or 0.85)
P(E|B) as the probability of the evidence (witness identification) given that the attacker is black (80% or 0.8)
P(E|W) as the probability of the evidence (witness identification) given that the attacker is white (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

We already know the values of P(B), P(W), P(E|B), and P(E|W). Plugging these in:

P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
