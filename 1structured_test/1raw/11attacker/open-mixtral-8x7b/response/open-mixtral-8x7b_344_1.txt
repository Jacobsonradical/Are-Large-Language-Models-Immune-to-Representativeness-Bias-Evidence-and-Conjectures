To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in estimating P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black. We are given the following pieces of information:

P(W|A) = 0.8: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
P(W|¬A) = 0.2: The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black
P(A) = 0.15: The prior probability that a person is black in the city
P(¬A) = 0.85: The prior probability that a person is white in the city

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

The term P(W) in the denominator is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
≈ 0.41

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.41}
