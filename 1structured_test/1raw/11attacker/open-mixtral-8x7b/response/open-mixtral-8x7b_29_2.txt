To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states that the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event multiplied by the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
