To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Let event A be the attacker being black and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From statement a, the probability of identifying a random person's race correctly is 0.8 when the person is black. So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is also 0.8. Similarly, the probability of identifying a random person's race as black when the person is white is 0.2 (20% error rate).

From statement b, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15 and the probability of a random person being white is 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem gives us:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Solving this equation, we get:
P(A|B) = 0.375 or 37.5%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.375}
