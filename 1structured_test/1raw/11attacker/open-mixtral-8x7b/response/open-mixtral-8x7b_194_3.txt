To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of A and B without considering each other

In this case, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
