To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

First, let's find P(W|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, we have P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. In the city, 15% of the population is black, so we have P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black under any condition. Using the law of total probability, we can write:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')

where A' is the complementary event of A (attacker is not black), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To find P(W|A'), we need to consider the false positive rate of the witness, which is 20%. Therefore, P(W|A') = 0.2.

Now we can compute P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate is {probability: 0.345,}.
