To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given:

P(W | B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(W | W') = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
P(B') = 0.85 (probability of a person being white)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a person being black)

We are interested in finding P(B | W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B | W) = (P(W | B) * P(B)) / (P(W | B) * P(B) + P(W | B') * P(B'))

In this case:
P(W | B) * P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15)
P(W | B') * P(B') = (0.2) * (0.85)

So,
P(B | W) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [{(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)}]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B | W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.36}
