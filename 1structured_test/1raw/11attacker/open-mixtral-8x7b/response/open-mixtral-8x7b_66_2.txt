To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.205

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 ≈ 0.585
