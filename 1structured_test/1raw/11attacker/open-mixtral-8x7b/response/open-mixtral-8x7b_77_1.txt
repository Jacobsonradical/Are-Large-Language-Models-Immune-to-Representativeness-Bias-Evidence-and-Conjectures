To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(A|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate is that there is a 36% chance that the attacker is black.
