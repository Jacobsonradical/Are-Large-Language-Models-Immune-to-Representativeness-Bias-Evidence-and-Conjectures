To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.3165

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.3165 or 31.65%.
