To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

First, let's find P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, P(W|B) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(B), the prior probability that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population in the city is black, we can assume that P(B) = 0.15.

To find P(W), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is black and the attacker is not black. We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)

where ~B represents the event that the attacker is not black, and P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

Since the witness identifies a person's race correctly 80% of the time and erroneously 20% of the time, P(W|~B) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 = 0.203 + 0.1445 = 0.3475.

Now, we can find P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.3475 = 0.12 = 12%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12}.
