To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black = 0.15 (from the information given)
P(~B) = probability the attacker is not black = 0.85 (1 - P(B))
P(W|B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 1 (assuming the witness correctly identifies the race when they can actually see the person)
P(W|~B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (20% error rate)
P(W) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

Now we want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We have all the values needed to compute this.

First, let's compute P(W):
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.34

Now, we can compute P(B|W):
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.34 â‰ˆ 0.4412

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4412.
