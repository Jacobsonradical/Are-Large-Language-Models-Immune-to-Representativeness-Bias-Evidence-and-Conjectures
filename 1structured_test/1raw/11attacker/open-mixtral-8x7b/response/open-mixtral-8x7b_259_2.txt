To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (15%, or 0.15)
P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black (85%, or 0.85)
P(W|B) as the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black (80%, or 0.8)
P(W|~B) as the probability that a witness identifies a white person as black (20%, or 0.2)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Plug in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

The answer: {probability: 0.36}
