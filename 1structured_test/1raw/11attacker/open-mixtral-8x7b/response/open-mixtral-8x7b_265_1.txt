To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random attacker is black, which is 0.15 (from the information given in "a").
- P(W|B) as the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from the information given in "b").
- P(W|~B) as the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (from the information given in "b"). We need to find P(~B), the probability of a random attacker being white, which is 0.85 (from the information given in "a").

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
