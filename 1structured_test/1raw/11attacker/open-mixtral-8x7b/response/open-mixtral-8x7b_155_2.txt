To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as A and the event that the witness identified the attacker as black as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

First, we need to calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white). Since the population is 15% black and the witness errs 20% of the time, a white attacker would be incorrectly identified as black 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, or 3%, of the time.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.7895

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.7895 or 78.95%.
