Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a random person in the city has a 15% chance of being black.
2. However, the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black doesn't give us a definitive answer, because the witness can make mistakes.
3. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. So, if the attacker was actually black, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as such, and a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as black when they're actually white.
5. We can express this as a conditional probability: P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8
6. But we also need to consider the opposite scenario: if the attacker was actually white, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as black.
7. We can express this as another conditional probability: P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2
8. Now, we need to find the overall probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is a case of Bayes' theorem.
9. Bayes' theorem states: P(attacker is black | witness says black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / P(witness says black)
10. The law of total probability tells us that P(witness says black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] + [P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]
11. Plugging in our numbers, we get:
   - P(attacker is black) = 0.15
   - P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8
   - P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2
   - P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 0.85
12. So, P(witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41
13. Finally, we can calculate P(attacker is black | witness says black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / P(witness says black)
14. Plugging in our numbers, we get: P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.293

Answer: {probability: 0.293}
