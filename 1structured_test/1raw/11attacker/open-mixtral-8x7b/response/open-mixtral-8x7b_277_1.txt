Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the error - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given the statistical information about the city's population, it would be tempting to conclude that the attacker is more likely to be white.
4. But the provided information does not allow us to make a more informed estimate about the attacker's race than the general population distribution.
5. Without knowing more about the direction of the witness's errors, we can't adjust our estimate based on the witness's testimony.

Therefore, the best estimate we can give is based on the city's population distribution:

{probability: 0.15}
