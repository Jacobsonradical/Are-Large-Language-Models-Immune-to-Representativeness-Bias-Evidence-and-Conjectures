To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events of interest are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the observation that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345.
