Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about the direction of the witness's errors - whether the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person or vice versa.
3. Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, and assuming the attacker is chosen at random from this population, we would initially estimate the probability of the attacker being black as 0.15.
4. But since we have the additional information about the witness, we can update our estimate using Bayes' theorem.
5. However, without knowing the direction of the witness's errors, we cannot provide a precise updated estimate.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black.
