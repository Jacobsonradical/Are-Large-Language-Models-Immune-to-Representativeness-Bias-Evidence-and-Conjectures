Let's analyze the information given. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Moreover, the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Let P(B) denote the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) denote the probability that the attacker is white. Given the city's population, we start with:

P(B) = 0.15
P(W) = 0.85

Now, let's define two events:
- C: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's race.
- I: The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race.

We are interested in the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(B|identified as black). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(B|identified as black) = P(identified as black|B) * P(B) / P(identified as black)

First, we need to calculate P(identified as black|B), which is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. We are given that this occurs 80% of the time, so:

P(identified as black|B) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate P(identified as black), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying a black attacker as black and a white attacker as black:

P(identified as black) = P(identified as black|B) * P(B) + P(identified as black|W) * P(W)

To calculate P(identified as black|W), we need to find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% (100% - 80% correct identification). So:

P(identified as black|W) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(identified as black):

P(identified as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|identified as black):

P(B|identified as black) = P(identified as black|B) * P(B) / P(identified as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

However, considering the witness's higher likelihood of error when identifying a white person as black, it is prudent to account for this uncertainty. We can express the answer as a range:

{probability: [0.345, 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.17)], explanation: "The lower bound represents the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, while the upper bound accounts for the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black."}

The answer is:

{probability: [0.345, 0.429], explanation: "The lower bound represents the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, while the upper bound accounts for the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black."}
