Let's analyze the information given and reason through it. We cannot determine the exact race of the attacker, but we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness identified the attacker as black, and we know that, in general, the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race under similar conditions. Additionally, 15% of the city's population is black. We need to combine these two pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black. Using the witness's ability to identify race, we can write:

P(B) = P(B|W) * P(W) + P(B|~W) * P(~W)

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (which is 80% or 0.8)
- P(W) is the probability that the witness is correct in identifying a black person (also 80% or 0.8)
- P(B|~W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's misidentification (which is 20% or 0.2, because the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(~W) is the probability that the witness is incorrect in identifying a black person (also 20% or 0.2)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.64 + 0.04 = 0.68

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.68.

Answer: {probability: 0.68}
