To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a black attacker correctly and identifying a white attacker incorrectly:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A denotes the complementary event of A (the attacker is not black, i.e., white), and P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black. Since the witness identifies a white person as black with an error rate of 20%, we have:

P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Putting everything together, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
