To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that they are black (P(W|A)), is 0.80, and the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that they are white (P(W|~A)), is 0.20.

What we want to find is P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

First, calculate P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
Then, calculate P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, divide P(W|A) * P(A) by the sum of P(W|A) * P(A) and P(W|~A) * P(~A):

P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
