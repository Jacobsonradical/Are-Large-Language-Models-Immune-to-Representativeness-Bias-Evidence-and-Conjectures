Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, the witness has identified the attacker as black. Given the error rate, there is a chance that the witness could be incorrect.
3. To calculate this, we can use the formula for total probability, which in this case is the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that they are black (true positive rate), plus the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that they are white (false positive rate).
4. The total population is divided into white and black, with 85% and 15% respectively.
5. Given these proportions, the probability of a randomly chosen person being black is 0.15, and the probability of them being white is 0.85.
6. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's race as black 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as black 20% of the time.
7. Therefore, the probability of a true positive is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12% chance), and the probability of a false positive is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17% chance).
8. Adding these together, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29% chance).

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
