To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate P(¬B|A) and P(¬B|¬A):
P(¬B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2
P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A) = 0.97

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.0255)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.824

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.824}
