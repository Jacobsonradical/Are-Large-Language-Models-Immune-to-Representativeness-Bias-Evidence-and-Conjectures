To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From part (a), we have P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) and P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

From part (b), we have P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is black) and P(¬B) = 0.85 (the prior probability that a random attacker is white).

We can now calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)
     = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Therefore,

P(B|W) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
     ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
