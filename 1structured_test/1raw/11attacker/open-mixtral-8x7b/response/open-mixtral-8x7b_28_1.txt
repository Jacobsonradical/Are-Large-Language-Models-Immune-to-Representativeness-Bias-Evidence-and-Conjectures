To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138}.
