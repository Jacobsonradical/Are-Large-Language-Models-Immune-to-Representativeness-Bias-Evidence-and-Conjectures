To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are given information about the witness's accuracy in identifying a person's race, and the racial distribution in the city. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's define the following events:

* B: the attacker is black
* W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:

* P(B): the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 since 15% of the population is black
* P(W|B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 1 since the witness identified the attacker as black
* P(W|not B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.20 since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not black
* P(not B): the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 since 85% of the population is not black

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

We can find P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)
= 1 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Therefore,

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)
= 1 \* 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.46875, or 46.875%.
