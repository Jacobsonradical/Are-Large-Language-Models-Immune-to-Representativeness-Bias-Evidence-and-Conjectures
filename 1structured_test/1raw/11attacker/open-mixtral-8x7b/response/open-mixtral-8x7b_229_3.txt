To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness identifying a black person when the person is actually black, which is 80% or 0.8.

We are also given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A').

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
