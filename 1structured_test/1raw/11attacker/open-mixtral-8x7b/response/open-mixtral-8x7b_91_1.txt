To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which is what we want to find)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white

From the information provided, we know that P(B|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify him as black, according to the 80% accuracy rate), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time when he is actually white).

We also know that P(~A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white) and so P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))
= 1 \* 0.15 / (1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.4688

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4688.
