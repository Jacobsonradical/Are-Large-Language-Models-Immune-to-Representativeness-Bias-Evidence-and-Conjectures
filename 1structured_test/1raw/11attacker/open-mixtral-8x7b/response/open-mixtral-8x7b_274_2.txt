Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided. This is a problem of conditional probability. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Here, B denotes the event that the attacker is black, and W denotes the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

We also need to calculate P(W|not B), which is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

So, P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black)

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38% when rounded to two decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (41%).
