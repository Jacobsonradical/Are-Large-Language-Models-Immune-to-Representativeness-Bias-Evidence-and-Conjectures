To reason through this problem, we first need to acknowledge that the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race as black is important, as well as their tendency to mistakenly identify a person as black when they are not.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, which is a hit rate of 0.8 for black people. However, the witness also erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, which is a false alarm rate of 0.2 for white people.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's identification using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Here, B represents the event of the attacker being black, and W represents the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of a random person being black)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness identifies a white person as black)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (prior probability of a random person being white)

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 36%.
