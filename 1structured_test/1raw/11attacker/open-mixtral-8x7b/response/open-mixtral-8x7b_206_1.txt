To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify them as black)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time when they are white)

To find P(~A), we use the fact that P(A) + P(~A) = 1, so P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.225

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.225 â‰ˆ 0.667

So our estimate is: {probability: 0.667}
