To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can use it to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness and the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is black (which is 0.15 based on the information given).
- P(~B) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is not black (which is 0.85 based on the information given).
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black (which is 1 based on the information given, since the witness identified the attacker as black).
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black (which is 0.2 based on the information given, since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values we get:

P(B|W) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4103

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4103.
