To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the city's population)

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities - the attacker is black or white. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') where A' denotes the complementary event that the attacker is white, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We are given that P(W|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.12 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.428571

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.43, rounded to two decimal places}
