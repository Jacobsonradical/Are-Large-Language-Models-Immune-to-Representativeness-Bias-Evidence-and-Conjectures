To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% from the info given)
P(~B) = probability the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% from the info given)
P(W|B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 1 (from the info given)
P(W|~B) = probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate when the true race is white)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(B|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(B|W) = 0.46875

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46875 or 46.875%.
