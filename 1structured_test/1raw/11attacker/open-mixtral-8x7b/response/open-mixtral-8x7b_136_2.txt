To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black. This is what we are trying to find. However, based on the population statistics given, we can assume this to be 15% or 0.15.
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying a random person as black. This is calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying a black person correctly and a white person incorrectly:
  - P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. This is given as 20% or 0.2.
  - P(not A): The probability that a random person is not black (white). This is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36 (36%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
