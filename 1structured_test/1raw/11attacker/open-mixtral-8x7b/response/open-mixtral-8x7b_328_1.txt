To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|A) =
