Let's reason through this:

1. We know that a witness identified the attacker as black, but we also know that the victim could not see the attacker's race, so the only information we have about the attacker's race comes from the witness.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, it would be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being black is 15%, but this information is not relevant because it doesn't take into account the accuracy of the witness.
4. Instead, we need to use the accuracy of the witness to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.
5. The witness identifies a person as black 80% of the time when the person is actually black, and identifies a person as black 20% of the time when the person is actually white.
6. Since we don't know the true race of the attacker, we can consider two possibilities: the attacker is actually black, or the attacker is actually white.
7. The probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).
8. The probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).
9. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

So, {probability: 0.29}
