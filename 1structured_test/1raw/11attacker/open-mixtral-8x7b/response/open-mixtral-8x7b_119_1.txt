To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black. This is what we're trying to find.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We are also given that 15% of the population is black, so P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.

Without this information, we cannot calculate an exact probability that the attacker is black. However, if we assume that the witness is equally likely to make a mistake identifying a non-black person as they are identifying a black person, then P(B|not A) would also be 0.2, and we could proceed with the calculation.

In this case, we would have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

And therefore:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.57

So, under this assumption, there is approximately a 57% chance that the attacker is black. However, without more information about the witness's ability to identify non-black people, we cannot give a definitive answer.
