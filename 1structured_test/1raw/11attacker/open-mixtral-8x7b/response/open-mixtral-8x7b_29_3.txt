To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define our terms:

- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in calculating P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as such.

We are given the following information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies black people as 20% of the time, where ¬A is the event that the attacker is not black)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(W|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)
P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17] ≈ 0.3158

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3158}
