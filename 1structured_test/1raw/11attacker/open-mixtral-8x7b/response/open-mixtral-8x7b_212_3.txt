To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be "The attacker is black" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the city's population)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
