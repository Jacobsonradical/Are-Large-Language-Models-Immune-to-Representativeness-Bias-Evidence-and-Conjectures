To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black (15% or 0.15)
- P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (85% or 0.85)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (20% or 0.2)

Now, let's compute:

- P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))
- P(W|B) = 0.8
- P(~W|B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2
- P(B) = 0.15
- P(~B) = 0.85

Now, let's fill in the values:

- P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
- P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.375}.
