To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event A).

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, P(~B) be the probability that the attacker is not black, P(A|B) be the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(A|~B) be the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.

From the given information, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time). Also, P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white), and P(A|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this value, we get:

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.36.
