To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black." Let's denote these events as A and B, respectively.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, where 0.15 is the proportion of the population that is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)

We want to find P(A|B), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.0255
= 0.1455

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1455
= 0.096

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.096, or 9.6%.
