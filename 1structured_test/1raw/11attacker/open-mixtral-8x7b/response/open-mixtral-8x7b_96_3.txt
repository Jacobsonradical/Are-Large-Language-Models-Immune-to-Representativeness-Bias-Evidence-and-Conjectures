To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - Attacker is black
W - Witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (attacker is not black, i.e., attacker is white)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
~ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
