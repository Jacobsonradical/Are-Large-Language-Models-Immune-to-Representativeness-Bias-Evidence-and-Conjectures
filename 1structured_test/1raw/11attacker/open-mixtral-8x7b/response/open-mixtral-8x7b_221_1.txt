To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B,
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A,
- P(A) is the prior probability of A,
- P(B) is the probability of B.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

To compute P(A|B), we first need to compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
