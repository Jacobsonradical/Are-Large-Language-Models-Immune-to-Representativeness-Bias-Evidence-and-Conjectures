To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We're interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know P(A), the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black, which is 0.15.

We also know P(W|A), the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly as black, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as black. This is a bit tricky because it depends on the population's racial makeup and the witness's accuracy for both races.

Let's calculate P(W):
- P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
