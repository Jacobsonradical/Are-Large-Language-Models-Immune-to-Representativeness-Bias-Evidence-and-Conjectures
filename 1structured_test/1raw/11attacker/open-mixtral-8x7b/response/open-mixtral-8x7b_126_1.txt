Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the city's population is black.
2. However, the reliability of the witness's identification needs to be taken into account. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. To find the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification, we multiply the base rate (15%) by the reliability of the witness (0.8), and then divide by the total probability of a true positive or false positive, which is the base rate (15%) multiplied by the reliability (0.8) plus the compliment of the base rate (85%) multiplied by the error rate (0.2).

Here's the calculation:
Probability of attacker being black = (base rate * reliability) / ((base rate * reliability) + (compliment of base rate * error rate))
= (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
