To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can use it to find the probability that the attacker is black given the information about the witness and the population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~B) as the probability that a random person in the city is not black (white), which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is not black (white), which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.36 or 36%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 36%.
