To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
B: A witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the data, we know that P(B|A) is the probability of a witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%). We also know that P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%, since 15% of the population is black).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is not black (A'). 

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
