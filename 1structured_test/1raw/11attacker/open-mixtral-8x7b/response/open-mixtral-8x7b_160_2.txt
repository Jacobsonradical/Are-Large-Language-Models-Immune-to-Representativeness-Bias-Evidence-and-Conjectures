To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that B has occurred.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that A has occurred.
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B independently.

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8 (P(B|A) = 0.8) and incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2 (P(!B|!A) = 0.2).

From statement b, we know that the proportion of black people in the city is 0.15 (P(A) = 0.15) and the proportion of white people is 0.85 (P(!A) = 0.85).

To calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)

We don't know P(B|!A) directly, but we can calculate it using the complementary probability P(!B|!A):

P(B|!A) = 1 - P(!B|!A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.345 or 34.5%.
