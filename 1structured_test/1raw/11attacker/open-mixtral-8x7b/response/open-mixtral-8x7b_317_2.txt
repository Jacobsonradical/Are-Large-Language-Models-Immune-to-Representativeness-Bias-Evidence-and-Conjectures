To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(A): the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black = 0.15 (15%)
- P(B|A): the probability that a black attacker is identified as black = 0.8 (80%)

However, we are missing P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases: the attacker is black (A) and the attacker is white (A'). So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%, white population)
- P(B|A'): the probability that a white attacker is identified as black = 0.2 (20%, since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the available information and assumptions, is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
