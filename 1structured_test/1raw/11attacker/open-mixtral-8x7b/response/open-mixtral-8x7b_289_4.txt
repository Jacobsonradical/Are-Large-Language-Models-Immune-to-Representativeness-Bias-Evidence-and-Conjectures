Let's analyze the information and make a probability estimate:
1. We have no reason to believe that the attacker's race is related to the city's population demographics, other than the witness's report.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's race and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we want to find the probability that the identification is correct.

Let's calculate the probability:
P(attacker is black | witness identified them as black) = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

We know that P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the information about the witness)
We also know that P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the city's demographics)

Now, apply Bayes' rule to find the probability we want:
P(attacker is black | witness identified them as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / P(witness identified black)

To calculate P(witness identified black), we use the law of total probability:
P(witness identified black) = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

We have the first term: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
For the second term, since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.2
And, P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the city's demographics)

So, the second term is: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, compute P(witness identified black):
P(witness identified black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:
P(attacker is black | witness identified them as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
