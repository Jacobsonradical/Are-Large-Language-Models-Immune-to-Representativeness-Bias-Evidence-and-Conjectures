To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that a witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(¬B), the probability that the attacker is not black:
P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black regardless of the attacker's race, using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 ≈ 0.3429

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3429.
