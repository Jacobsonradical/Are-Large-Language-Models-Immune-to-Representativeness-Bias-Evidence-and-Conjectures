To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(not A) = 0.85 (the population that is not black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the population that is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
