To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with 80% probability)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white and 15% is black)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possible scenarios. That is, the attacker is either black or white. So, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.4138}
