Let's analyze the given information and calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The attacker was identified as black, but since we don't know their actual race, let's denote the true race as R (R = black or R = white).
3. We need to find the probability P(R = black | identified as black) which is the probability of the attacker being black given that they were identified as black.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

   P(R = black | identified as black) = P(identified as black | R = black) * P(R = black) / P(identified as black)

5. We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, so P(R = black) = 0.15.
6. The probability of identifying a black person correctly is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
7. Therefore, P(identified as black | R = black) = 0.8 and P(identified as black | R = white) = 0.17.
8. To find P(identified as black), we can use the law of total probability: P(identified as black) = P(identified as black | R = black) * P(R = black) + P(identified as black | R = white) * P(R = white).
9. Plugging in the values, we get: P(identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645.

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that they were identified as black:

P(R = black | identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

Answer: {probability: 0.4535}
