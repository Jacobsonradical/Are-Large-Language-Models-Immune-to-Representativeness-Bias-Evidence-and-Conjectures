To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for two mutually exclusive events: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as such, and the attacker is not black (white) and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the final answer is:
{probability: 0.517241, "explanation": "This is calculated as P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.36 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.517241"}
