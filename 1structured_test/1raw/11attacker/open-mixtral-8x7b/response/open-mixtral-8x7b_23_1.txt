To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is black" and "the witness identified the attacker as black." Let's denote these events A and B, respectively.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): the probability of observing event B given that event A is true, i.e., the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This probability is 1, since the witness made a positive identification.
- P(B|¬A): the probability of observing event B given that event A is false, i.e., the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This probability is 0.2, since the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies a white person as black.
- P(A): the prior probability of event A, i.e., the probability that the attacker is black. This probability is not given directly, but we are given information that allows us to estimate it.
- P(¬A): the prior probability of event ¬A, i.e., the probability that the attacker is white. This probability is 1 - P(A).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

We can estimate P(A) using the given information about the racial composition of the city. Specifically, if 15% of the population is black, then the prior probability that the attacker is black is also 0.15. Similarly, the prior probability that the attacker is white is 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 1 \* 0.15 / (1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4688

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4688}
