Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't have any information about which race the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify as black. 
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the base rate fallacy, which states that one should take into account prior knowledge rather than just new information.
4. Prior knowledge tells us that 15% of the population is black, so a conservative estimate would be to assume that the attacker is black with a probability of 15%.

However, because the witness identified the attacker as black, we should adjust this estimate upwards. The amount we adjust it by depends on how much more reliable we think the witness is than our prior knowledge. If we assume the witness is twice as reliable as our prior knowledge, we could adjust the estimate to 30%. But without more information, it's hard to make a more precise estimate.

Here's the answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.30}. This answer reflects a compromise between the base rate (15%) and the witness's identification (which, if completely reliable, would imply a probability of 100%).
