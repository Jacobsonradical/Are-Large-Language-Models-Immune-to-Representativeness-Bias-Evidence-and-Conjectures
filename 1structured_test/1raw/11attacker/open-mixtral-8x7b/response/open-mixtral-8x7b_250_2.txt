To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the data provided, we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.0255
= 0.1455

Then, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1455
â‰ˆ 0.8261

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.8261}
