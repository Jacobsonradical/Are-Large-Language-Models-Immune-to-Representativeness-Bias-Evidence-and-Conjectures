To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know from the question that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(~A) = 0.85 (Since 15% of the population is black, 85% must be white)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
