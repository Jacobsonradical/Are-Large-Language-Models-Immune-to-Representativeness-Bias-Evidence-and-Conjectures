To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of A and B respectively

In this case, let A be "the attacker is black" and B be "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are asked to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider the possibility that the attacker is white and the witness makes an error. Let's denote "the attacker is white" by ~A. Then, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time). The prior probability of the attacker being white is P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white). Therefore, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.345}
