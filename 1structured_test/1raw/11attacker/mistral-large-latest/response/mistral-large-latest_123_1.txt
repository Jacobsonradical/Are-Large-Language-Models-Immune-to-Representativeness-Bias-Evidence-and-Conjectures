To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that the attacker is black, and \( P(W) \) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.

Let \( P(I|B) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and \( P(I|W) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

Given:
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (80% correct identification when the attacker is black)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (20% incorrect identification when the attacker is white)

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}}
\]
