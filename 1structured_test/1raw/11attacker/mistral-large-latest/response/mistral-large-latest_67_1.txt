To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that the attacker is black, and \( P(W) \) be the probability that the attacker is white. Let \( P(I|B) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and \( P(I|W) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
