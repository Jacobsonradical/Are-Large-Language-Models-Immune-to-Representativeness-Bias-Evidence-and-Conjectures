To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability that a random person is black, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) as the prior probability that a random person is white, which is 0.85.
- \( P(I|B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually black, which is 0.80.
- \( P(I|W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually white, which is 0.20.

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
