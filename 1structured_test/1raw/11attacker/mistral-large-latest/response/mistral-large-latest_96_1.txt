To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white.
- \( P(I|B) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I|W) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(B|I) \) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
