To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is black.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

So, the answer is:
\[ \{\text{probability: } 0.4138\} \]
