To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(I | B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(I | W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white).

We want to find \( P(B | I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(I) = P(I | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B | I) \):

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
