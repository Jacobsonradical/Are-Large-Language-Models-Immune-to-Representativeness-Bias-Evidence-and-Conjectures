To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
2. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
3. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
