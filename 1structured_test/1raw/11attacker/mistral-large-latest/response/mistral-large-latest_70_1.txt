To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( I \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(I | B) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black).
- \( P(I | W) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white).

We want to find \( P(B | I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(I) = P(I | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B | I) \):
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
