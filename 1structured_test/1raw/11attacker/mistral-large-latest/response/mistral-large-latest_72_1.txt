To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is black.
- \( P(W) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is white.
- \( P(I|B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually black.
- \( P(I|W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually white.
- \( P(B|I) \) as the probability that the person is black given that the witness identified the person as black.

From the information given:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
2. \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
3. \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
4. \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Where \( P(I) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {probability: 0.4138}
\]
