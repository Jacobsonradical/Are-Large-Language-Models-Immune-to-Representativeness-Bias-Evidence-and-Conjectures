To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is black, and let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
