To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white.
- \( P(I|B) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I|W) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(B|I) \) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{\text{{probability: 0.4138}}}
\]
