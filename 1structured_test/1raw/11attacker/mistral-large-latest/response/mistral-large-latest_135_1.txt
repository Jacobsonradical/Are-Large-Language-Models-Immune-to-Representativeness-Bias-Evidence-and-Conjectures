To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is black, and \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is not black)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
