To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( I \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(I | B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- \( P(I | W) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(B | I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(I) = P(I | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B | I) \):

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
