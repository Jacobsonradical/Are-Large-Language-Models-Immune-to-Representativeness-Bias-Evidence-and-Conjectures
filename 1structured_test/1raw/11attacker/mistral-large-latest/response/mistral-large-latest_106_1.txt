To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is black.
- \( P(W) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is white.
- \( P(I|B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually black.
- \( P(I|W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually white.
- \( P(I) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as black.
- \( P(B|I) \) as the probability that the person is black given that the witness identified the person as black.

From the information given:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
2. \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
3. \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
4. \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(B|I) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(I) \):

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
