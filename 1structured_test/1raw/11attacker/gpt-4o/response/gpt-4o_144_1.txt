We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We can do this by considering both scenarios: the attacker is black and the attacker is white.

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.20 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time for both races, the error rate is 20%).

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \)

We can substitute these values into the formula for \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
