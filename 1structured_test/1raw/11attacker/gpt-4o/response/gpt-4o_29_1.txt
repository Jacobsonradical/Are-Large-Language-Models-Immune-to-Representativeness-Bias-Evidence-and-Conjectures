To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

We are given:
- The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black (True Positive Rate): \( P(\text{Identifies Black} | \text{Black}) = 0.8 \)
- The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are white (False Positive Rate): \( P(\text{Identifies Black} | \text{White}) = 0.2 \)
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black: \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \)
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white: \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black: \( P(\text{Black} | \text{Identifies Black}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identifies Black} | \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identifies Black})} \]

To find \( P(\text{Identifies Black}) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = P(\text{Identifies Black} | \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identifies Black} | \text{White}) \cdot P(\text{White}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identifies Black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.414}.
