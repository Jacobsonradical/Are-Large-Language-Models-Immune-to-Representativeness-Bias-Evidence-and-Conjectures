To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote the events as:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The attacker was identified as black by the witness.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time when identifying race)

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
