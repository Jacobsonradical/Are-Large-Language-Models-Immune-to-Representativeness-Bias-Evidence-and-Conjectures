To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it can be calculated:

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( I_B \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B \mid I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{P(I_B \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(I_B \mid B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

To find \( P(I_B) \):

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(I_B \mid W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is the error rate, 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate \( P(I_B) \):

\[ P(I_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid I_B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
