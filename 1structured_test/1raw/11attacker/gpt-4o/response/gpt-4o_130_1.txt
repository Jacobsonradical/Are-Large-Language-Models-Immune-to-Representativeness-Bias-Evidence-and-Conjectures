To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( B \) = Attacker is black
- \( W \) = Attacker is white
- \( I_B \) = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We need to calculate \( P(B|I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(I_B|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(I_B|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a black individual)
- \( P(I_W|B) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white individual as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (proportion of black individuals in the population)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (proportion of white individuals in the population)

We need to find \( P(I_B) \):

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Since \( P(I_B|W) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white individual as black):

\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I_B) \):

\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
