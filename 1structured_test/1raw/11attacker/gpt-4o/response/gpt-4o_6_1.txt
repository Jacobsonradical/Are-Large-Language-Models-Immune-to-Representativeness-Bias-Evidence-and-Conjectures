To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
