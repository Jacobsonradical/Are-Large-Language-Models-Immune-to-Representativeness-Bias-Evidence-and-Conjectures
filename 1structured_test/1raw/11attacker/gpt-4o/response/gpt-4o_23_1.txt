To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (\( B \) given \( W \)).
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as black.

Given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 80%)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 20%)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that any randomly chosen person is black is 15%)
- \( P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \)

Let's calculate \( P(W) \) first:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
