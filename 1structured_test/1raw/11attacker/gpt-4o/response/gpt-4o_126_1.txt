To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. Prior probabilities: 
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
   
2. The witness's identification accuracies:
   - \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black.
   - \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
