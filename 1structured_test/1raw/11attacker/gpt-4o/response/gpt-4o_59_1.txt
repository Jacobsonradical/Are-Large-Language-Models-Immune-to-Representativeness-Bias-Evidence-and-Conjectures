To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the specified information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is formulated as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

### Steps to Calculate
1. **Define the probabilities**:
   - \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
   - \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when they are white)
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
   - \( P(W) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
     \[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]

2. **Calculate \( P(W) \)**:
   \[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
