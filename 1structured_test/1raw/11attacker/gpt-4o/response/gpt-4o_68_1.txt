To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black,
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white,
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that any randomly chosen person is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that any randomly chosen person is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies them as black.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
