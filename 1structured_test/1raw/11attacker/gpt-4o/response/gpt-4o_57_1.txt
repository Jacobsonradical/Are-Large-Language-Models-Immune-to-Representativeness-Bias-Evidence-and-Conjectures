To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \) = Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) = Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|W) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information, we have:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
