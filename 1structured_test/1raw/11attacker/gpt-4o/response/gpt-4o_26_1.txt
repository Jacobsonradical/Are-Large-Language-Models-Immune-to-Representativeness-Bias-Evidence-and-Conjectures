To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black and \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

First, we break down the components:
1. \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the given information, \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
2. \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black. This is 80%, or \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \).
3. \( P(W|W^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white. This is 20%, or \( P(W|W^c) = 0.2 \).

Next, we need \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This is calculated by considering both possibilities (either the attacker is black or white):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W^c) \cdot P(W^c) \]

Here \( P(W^c) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is \( 1 - P(B) = 0.85 \).

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
