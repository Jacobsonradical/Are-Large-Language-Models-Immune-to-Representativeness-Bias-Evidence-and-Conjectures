To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

Given data:
- \( P(Black) \) = Probability that a random person from the city is black = 0.15
- \( P(White) \) = Probability that a random person from the city is white = 0.85
- \( P(Witness\ says\ Black\ | Black) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is black given the attacker is black = 0.80
- \( P(Witness\ says\ Black\ | White) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is black given the attacker is white = 0.20

We need to find \( P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) = \frac{P(Witness\ says\ Black | Black) \cdot P(Black)}{P(Witness\ says\ Black)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(Witness\ says\ Black) \) which can be calculated as:
\[ P(Witness\ says\ Black) = P(Witness\ says\ Black | Black) \cdot P(Black) + P(Witness\ says\ Black | White) \cdot P(White) \]
\[ P(Witness\ says\ Black) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(Witness\ says\ Black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) \):
\[ P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Black | Witness\ says\ Black) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
