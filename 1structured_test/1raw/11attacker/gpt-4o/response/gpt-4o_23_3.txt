To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(E) \), which we can get by considering both cases (the attacker is black or white):

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
- The population is 85% white and 15% black.

This gives us:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

Using these values in our equation:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
