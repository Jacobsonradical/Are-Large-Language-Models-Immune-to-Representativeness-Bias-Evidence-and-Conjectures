To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Let:
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( \text{Witness says black} \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says black} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Witness says black})} \]

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(\text{Witness says black} \mid B) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness says black} \mid W) = 0.2 \)

3. **Total Probability of the Witness saying black:**
   \[ P(\text{Witness says black}) = P(\text{Witness says black} \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{Witness says black} \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]
   \[ P(\text{Witness says black}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(\text{Witness says black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(\text{Witness says black}) = 0.29 \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   \[ P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says black} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Witness says black})} \]
   \[ P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B \mid \text{Witness says black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.4138}
