To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our initial estimate (prior probability) with new information (likelihood).

Let's define:
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \)

We aim to find \( P(B|E) \): Probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
