To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability of a random person being black.
- \( P(W) \) as the prior probability of a random person being white.
- \( P(E | B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is actually black.
- \( P(E | W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is actually white.
- \( P(B | E) \) as the posterior probability that the person is actually black given that the witness identifies them as black, which is what we are trying to calculate.

Based on the given information:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (accuracy of the witness for identifying black people)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (error rate for identifying white people as black)

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B | E) \):

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
