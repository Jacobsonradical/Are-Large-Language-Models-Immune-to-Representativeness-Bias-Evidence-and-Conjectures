To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. 

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem description:

- The probability that a person randomly chosen is black: \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
- The probability that a person randomly chosen is white: \( P(W) = 0.85 \).

The court assessed the witness's ability:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \): The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time.
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \): The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is about 0.4138.
