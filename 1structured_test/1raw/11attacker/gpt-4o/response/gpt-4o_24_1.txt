To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black.

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \) which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This can be broken down into two parts:
- The probability the witness identifies a black person correctly if the attacker is indeed black.
- The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Let's compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
