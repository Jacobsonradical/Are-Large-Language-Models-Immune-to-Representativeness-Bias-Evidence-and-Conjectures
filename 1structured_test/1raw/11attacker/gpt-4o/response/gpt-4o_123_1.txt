To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

We need to find \( P(\text{black} \mid \text{identified as black}) \).

Let's denote the following probabilities:
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(\text{id black} \mid B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given they are black.
- \( P(\text{id black} \mid W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given they are white.
- \( P(\text{id black}) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(\text{id black} \mid B) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(\text{id black} \mid W) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{id black}) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{id black}) = P(\text{id black} \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{id black} \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(\text{id black}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{id black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{id black}) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B \mid \text{id black}) \):

\[ P(B \mid \text{id black}) = \frac{P(\text{id black} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{id black})} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{id black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{id black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{id black}) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately \( 0.414 \).
