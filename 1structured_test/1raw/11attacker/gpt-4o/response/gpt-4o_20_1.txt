To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem in this context is:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any given person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \)

Let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
