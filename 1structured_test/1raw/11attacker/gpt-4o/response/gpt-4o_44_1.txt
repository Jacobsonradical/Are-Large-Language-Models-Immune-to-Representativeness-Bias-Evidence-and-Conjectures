To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the notation and steps to solve for \( P(B|W) \):

- \( P(B) \): Prior probability that the attacker is black. Given from the population, \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(W|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Given from the witness's accuracy, \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W|W') \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Given the witness's error rate, \( P(W|W') = 0.20 \).
- \( P(W') \): Prior probability that the attacker is white. Given from the population, \( P(W') = 0.85 \).

We need to calculate \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black), which is given by:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W') * P(W') \]

Now let's plug in the numbers:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) * P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.80 * 0.15)}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
