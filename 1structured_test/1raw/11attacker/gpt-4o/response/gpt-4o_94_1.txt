To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification and the demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( ID_B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(ID_B|B) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(ID_B|W) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is white)

We need to find \( P(B|ID_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|ID_B) = \frac{P(ID_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_B)} \]

Where \( P(ID_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(ID_B) = P(ID_B|B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_B|W) \cdot P(W) \]

So:

\[ P(ID_B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|ID_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|ID_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|ID_B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is approximately 0.4138.
