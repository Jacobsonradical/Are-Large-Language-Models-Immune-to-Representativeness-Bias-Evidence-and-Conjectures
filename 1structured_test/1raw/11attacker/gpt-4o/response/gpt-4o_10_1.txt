To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. 

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
