To determine the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Given:
- The witness's accuracy: 80% (for both true positives and true negatives).
- The population distribution: 85% white and 15% black.
- The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to calculate \( P(Black|Witness\ says\ Black) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(Black|W) = \frac{P(W|Black) \cdot P(Black)}{P(W|Black) \cdot P(Black) + P(W|White) \cdot P(White)} \]

Where:
- \( P(Black|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness says the attacker is black.
- \( P(W|Black) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually black (witness accuracy: 80% or 0.8).
- \( P(Black) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15% or 0.15, based on population data).
- \( P(W|White) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually white (incorrect identification rate: 20% or 0.2).
- \( P(White) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white (85% or 0.85, based on population data).

Putting these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Black|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2\  \times 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, put these into the formula:

\[ P(Black|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
