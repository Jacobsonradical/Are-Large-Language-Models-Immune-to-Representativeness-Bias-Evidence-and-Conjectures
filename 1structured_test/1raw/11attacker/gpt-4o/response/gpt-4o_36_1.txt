To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how:

Let's define the events:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to determine each part of this equation:

1. **\( P(B) \): Probability that a random person in the city is black:**

\[
P(B) = 0.15
\]

2. **\( P(W) \): Probability that a random person in the city is white:**

\[
P(W) = 0.85
\]

3. **\( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is black:**
   
Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time:

\[
P(E|B) = 0.80
\]

4. **\( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is white:**
   
This is the error rate, i.e., the witness misidentifying a white person as black, which is 20%:

\[
P(E|W) = 0.20
\]

5. **\( P(E) \): Total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:**
   
This is calculated using the law of total probability, considering both races:

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\{
  "probability": 0.41
\}

Note: The number has been rounded to two decimal places.
