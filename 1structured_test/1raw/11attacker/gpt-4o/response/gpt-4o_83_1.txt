To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Given the information, we define the events as follows:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in \( P(B|E) \): the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we determine each component:
1. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black.
2. \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability that the witness identifies any person as black.

From the information given:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

To find \( P(E) \), the law of total probability is used:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
