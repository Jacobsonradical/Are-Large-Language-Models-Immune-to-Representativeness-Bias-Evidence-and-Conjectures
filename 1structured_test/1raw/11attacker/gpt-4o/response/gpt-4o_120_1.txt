To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which can be found using the law of total probability.

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being white (85% or 0.85).

Now we plug in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.414.
