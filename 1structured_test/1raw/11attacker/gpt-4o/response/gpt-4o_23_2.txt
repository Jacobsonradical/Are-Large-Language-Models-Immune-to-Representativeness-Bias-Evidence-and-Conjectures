To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identified as Black})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Black}) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black}) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black.

To find \( P(\text{Identified as Black}) \):

\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{White}) \cdot P(\text{White}) \]

Here:
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{White}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\text{White}) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
