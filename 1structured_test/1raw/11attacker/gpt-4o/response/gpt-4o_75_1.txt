To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time when identifying the attacker's race)

First, we compute \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
