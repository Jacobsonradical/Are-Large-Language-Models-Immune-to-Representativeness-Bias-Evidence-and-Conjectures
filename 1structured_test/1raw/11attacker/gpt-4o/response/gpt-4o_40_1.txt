To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define events**:
    - \( B \): The attacker is black.
    - \( W \): The attacker is white.
    - \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Given probabilities**:
    - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is black).
    - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is white).

3. **Witness reliability**:
    - \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black).
    - \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white).

4. **Goal**:
    - Find the posterior probability \( P(B|E) \): the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|E) \):
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately \( 0.414 \).
