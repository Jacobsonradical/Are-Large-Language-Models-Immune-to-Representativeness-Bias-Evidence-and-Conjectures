To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the relevant terms and apply the theorem.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a person chosen at random is black \( P(B) \): 0.15
   - Probability that a person chosen at random is white \( P(W) \): 0.85

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given the person is black \( P(\text{Identifies Black} | B) \): 0.80
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person, given the person is white \( P(\text{Identifies Black} | W) \): 0.20

3. **Posterior Probability**: We need to determine \( P(B | \text{Identifies Black}) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identifies Black} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Identifies Black})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Identifies Black}) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black:
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = P(\text{Identifies Black} | B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{Identifies Black} | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies Black}) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies Black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
