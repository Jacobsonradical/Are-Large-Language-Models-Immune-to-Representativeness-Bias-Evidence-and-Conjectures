To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the city's racial demographics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Identify the prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \)

2. **Identify the likelihoods:**
   - \( P(\text{Witness says Black} \mid \text{Black}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness says Black} \mid \text{White}) = 0.20 \)

3. **Calculate the total probability of the witness saying Black:**

\[ P(\text{Witness says Black}) = P(\text{Witness says Black} \mid \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Witness says Black} \mid \text{White}) \cdot P(\text{White}) \]

\[ P(\text{Witness says Black}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{Witness says Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(\text{Witness says Black}) = 0.29 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness says Black}) \):**

\[ P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness says Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Black} \mid \text{Black}) \cdot P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Witness says Black})} \]

\[ P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness says Black}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness says Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness says Black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
