To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( B \): The attacker is black.
   - \( W \): The attacker is white.
   - \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

2. **Probabilities given:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability of the attacker being black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability of the attacker being white)
   - \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black)
   - \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are white)

3. **Bayes' theorem** states:
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) P(B)}{P(E | B) P(B) + P(E | W) P(W)}
   \]

4. **Calculate the denominator \( P(E) \):**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E | B) P(B) + P(E | W) P(W)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate the posterior probability \( P(B | E) \):**
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.4138.
