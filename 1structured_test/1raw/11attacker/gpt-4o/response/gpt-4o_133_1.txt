To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (80%, or 0.80).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15%, or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which can be calculated as follows:
  \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
  Where:
  - \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20%, or 0.20 when \( W \) is white).
  - \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white (85%, or 0.85).

Now, let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.41}
