To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|\text{White}) = 0.20 \) (since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% the population is white)
- \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(W) \), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|\text{White}) \cdot P(\text{White}) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
