To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find the individual probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (The probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
   - \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

3. **Total Probability of \( E \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
