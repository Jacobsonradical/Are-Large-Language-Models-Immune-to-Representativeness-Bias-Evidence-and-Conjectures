To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black),
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white),
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black),
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).

We want to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

We first need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use the values in Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
