To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's define the probabilities we know:
1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is black).
2. \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).
3. \( P(W|W) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a white person 80% of the time).
4. \( P(W|B') = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person when they are actually white).

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|B') \cdot P(B') \]

Where:
- \( P(B') = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is white).
- \( P(W|B') = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
