To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

1. Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
2. Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
3. Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' Theorem tells us that:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's identify each component needed:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white, which is \( 0.85 \).
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is \( 0.80 \).
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is \( 0.20 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
