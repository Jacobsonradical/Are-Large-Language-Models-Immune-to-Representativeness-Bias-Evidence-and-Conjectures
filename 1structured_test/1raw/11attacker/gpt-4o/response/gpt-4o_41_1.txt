To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

Here is what we have:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is black = 0.15
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is white = 0.85
- \( P(E | B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person = 0.80
- \( P(E | W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black = 0.20

We want to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(B | E) \):

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
