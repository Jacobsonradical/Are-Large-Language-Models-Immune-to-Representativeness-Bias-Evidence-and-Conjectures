To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

\[ \text{Bayes' Theorem:} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
-  \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (80% chance witness correctly identifies a black person)
-  \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
-  \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (20% chance witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
-  \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability.

Law of total probability for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white.

Given:
-  \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (20% chance witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
-  \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and population distribution, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
