To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are looking for \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate each of these probabilities. 

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Now, we need to find \( P(E) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.
