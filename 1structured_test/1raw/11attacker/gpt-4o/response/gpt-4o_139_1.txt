To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on city demographics).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's define our terms based on the information given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population in the city is black)
- \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as a weighted combination of the witness identifying a black and white person as black)

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W_{\text{white}}) \]
Where \( P(W_{\text{white}}) = 1 - P(B) \) (since the rest of the population is white)

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.
