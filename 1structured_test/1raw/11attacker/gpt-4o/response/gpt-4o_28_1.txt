To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as black given that they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black.

### Given Information:
1. The prior probabilities:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that an attacker chosen at random is black).
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that an attacker chosen at random is white).

2. The witness's probability of identifying race correctly:
   - \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
   - \( P(W|W) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white).
   - Hence, \( P(W|B') = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white).
   - And \( P(W|W') = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).

Now we need to compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be done by considering both cases (the attacker is black or the attacker is white):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|B') \cdot P(B') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we calculate the posterior probability \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the answer in the specified format:

{probability: 0.4138}
