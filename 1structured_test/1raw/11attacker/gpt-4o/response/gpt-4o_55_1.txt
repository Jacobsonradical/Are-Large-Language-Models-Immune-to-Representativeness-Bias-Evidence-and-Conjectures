To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W | B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's define our probabilities:
- \( P(W | B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black)
- \( P(W | W) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(W) = P(W | B)P(B) + P(W | W)P(W) \)

Given:
- \( P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \)
- \( P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.29 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.41} \]
