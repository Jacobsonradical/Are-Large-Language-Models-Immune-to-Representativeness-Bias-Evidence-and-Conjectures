To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|E) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of an attacker being black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 \)

The witness's accuracy rates:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time, i.e., identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white).

We need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be found using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

So:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
