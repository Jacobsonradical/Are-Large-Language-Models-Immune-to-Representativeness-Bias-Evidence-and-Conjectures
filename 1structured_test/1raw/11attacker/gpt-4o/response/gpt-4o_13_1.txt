To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

Given the city's population demographics:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately \( 0.414 \).
