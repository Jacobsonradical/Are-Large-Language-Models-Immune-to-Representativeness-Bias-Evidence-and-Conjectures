To address this question, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( ID_{B} \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that an attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that an attacker is white)
- \( P(ID_{B} | B) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(ID_{B} | W) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(B | ID_{B}) \):

\[
P(B | ID_{B}) = \frac{P(ID_{B} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_{B})}
\]

We first need to compute \( P(ID_{B}) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(ID_{B}) = P(ID_{B} | B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_{B} | W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(ID_{B}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | ID_{B}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
