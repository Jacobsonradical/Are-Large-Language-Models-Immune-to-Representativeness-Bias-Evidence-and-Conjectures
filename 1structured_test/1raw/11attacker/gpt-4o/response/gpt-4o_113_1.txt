To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to calculate \( P(B | I_B) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(I_B | B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black. This is given as 0.80.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. This is the proportion of black people in the city, given as 0.15.
- \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(I_B | W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white. This is \(1 - \text{the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race}\), so \( 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white. This is the proportion of white people in the city, given as 0.85.

So,

\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | I_B) \approx 0.414 \]

So,

{probability: 0.414}
