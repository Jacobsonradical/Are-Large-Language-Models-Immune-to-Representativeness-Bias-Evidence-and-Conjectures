To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) represent the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black, based on population demographics)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white, based on population demographics)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness identifies a white person as black)

We need to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
