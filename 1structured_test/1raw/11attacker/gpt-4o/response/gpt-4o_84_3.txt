To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and \( I \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \times P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I|B) \) is the conditional probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is black)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (witness's accuracy for identifying a black person)
- \( P(I|\neg B) = 0.20 \) (witness's error rate for identifying a white person as black)

To find \( P(I) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \times P(B) + P(I|\neg B) \times P(\neg B) \]

Where:
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is white)
- \( P(I|\neg B) = 0.20 \)

So:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Then:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
