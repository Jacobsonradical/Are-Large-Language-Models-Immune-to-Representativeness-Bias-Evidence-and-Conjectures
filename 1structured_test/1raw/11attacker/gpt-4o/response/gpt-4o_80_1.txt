Let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find \( P(B | \text{witness says black}) \).

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{witness says black} | B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{witness says black} | W) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | \text{witness says black}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says black} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{witness says black})} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{witness says black}) \):

\[ P(\text{witness says black}) = P(\text{witness says black} | B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{witness says black} | W) \cdot P(W) \]

\[ P(\text{witness says black}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{witness says black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(\text{witness says black}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B | \text{witness says black}) \):

\[ P(B | \text{witness says black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | \text{witness says black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | \text{witness says black}) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
