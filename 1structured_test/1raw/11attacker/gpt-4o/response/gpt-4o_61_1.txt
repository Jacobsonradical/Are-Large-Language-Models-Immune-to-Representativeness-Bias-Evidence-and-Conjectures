To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic breakdown of the city's population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any given person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate each component:
1. \( P(W|B) \): According to the information, the witness correctly identifies black individuals 80% of the time. Thus, \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \).

2. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that any given person in the city is black is 15%. Thus, \( P(B) = 0.15 \).

3. \( P(W) \): This is the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. This can be determined using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]
   Where:
   - \( P(W|W') \) is the probability that the witness identifies a white individual as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, \( P(W|W') = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(W') \) is the prior probability that any given person in the city is white, which is 85%. Thus, \( P(W') = 0.85 \).

   Plugging these values in:
   \[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
