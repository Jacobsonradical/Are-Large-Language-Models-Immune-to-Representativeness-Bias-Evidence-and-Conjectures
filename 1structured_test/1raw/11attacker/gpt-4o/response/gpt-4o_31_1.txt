To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Let's define the following events:
   - \( B \): the attacker is black
   - \( W \): the attacker is white
   - \( ID_B \): the witness identified the attacker as black

2. We are given:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is white)
   - \( P(ID_B \mid B) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black individual as black)
   - \( P(ID_B \mid W) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white individual as black)

3. We need to find \( P(B \mid ID_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{P(ID_B \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_B)} \]

4. To find \( P(ID_B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(ID_B) = P(ID_B \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_B \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(ID_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.29 \]

5. Now we can calculate \( P(B \mid ID_B) \):

\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid ID_B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
