To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \(B\) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \(E\) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities:

1. \(\Pr(B) = 0.15\), the prior probability that the attacker is black.
2. \(\Pr(W) = 0.85\), the prior probability that the attacker is white.
3. \(\Pr(E|B) = 0.80\), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black.
4. \(\Pr(E|W) = 0.20\), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black.

We want to find \(\Pr(B|E)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[
\Pr(B|E) = \frac{\Pr(E|B) \cdot \Pr(B)}{\Pr(E)}
\]

\[
\Pr(E) = \Pr(E|B) \cdot \Pr(B) + \Pr(E|W) \cdot \Pr(W)
\]

First, let's calculate \(\Pr(E)\):

\[
\Pr(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
\Pr(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \(\Pr(B|E)\):

\[
\Pr(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
