To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \) : The attacker is black
- \( W \) : The attacker is white
- \( E \) : The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

We need to determine the elements of this equation:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. According to the witness's accuracy, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white. This is the error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

We also need to calculate \( P(E) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
