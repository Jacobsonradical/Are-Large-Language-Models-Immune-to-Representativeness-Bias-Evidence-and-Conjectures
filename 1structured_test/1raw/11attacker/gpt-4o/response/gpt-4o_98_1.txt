To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white. Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white)

We want to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identifies the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found by considering both possibilities (attacker is black or white):

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
