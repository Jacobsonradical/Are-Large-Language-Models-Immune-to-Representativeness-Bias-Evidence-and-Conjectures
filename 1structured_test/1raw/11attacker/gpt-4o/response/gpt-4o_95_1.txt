To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

We want to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Now we can plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
