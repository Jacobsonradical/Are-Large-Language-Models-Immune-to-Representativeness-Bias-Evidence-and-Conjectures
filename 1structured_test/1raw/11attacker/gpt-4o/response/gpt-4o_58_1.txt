To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:
- \( W \) is the event that the attacker is white.
- \( B \) is the event that the attacker is black.
- \( E \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white.
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black.

We want to determine \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

We can find \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
