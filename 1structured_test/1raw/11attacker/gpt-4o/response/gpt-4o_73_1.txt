To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Step-by-step calculation for \( P(B|W) \):

1. **Calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:**

\[ P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|W)P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, since the witness errs 20% of the time)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is white)

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

2. **Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
