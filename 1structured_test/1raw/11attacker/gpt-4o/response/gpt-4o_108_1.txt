To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is black.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on population statistics).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is white).
- \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black).
- \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
