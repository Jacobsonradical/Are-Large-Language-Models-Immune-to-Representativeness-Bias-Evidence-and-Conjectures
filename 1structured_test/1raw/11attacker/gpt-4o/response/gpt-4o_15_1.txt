To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. We'll denote:

- \( P(B) \): The probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): The probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information, we have:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
