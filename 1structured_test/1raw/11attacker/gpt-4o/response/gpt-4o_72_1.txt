To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (true positive rate).
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (false positive rate).
- \( P(B|E) \): The posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \)

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), which can be done using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute \( P(E) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
