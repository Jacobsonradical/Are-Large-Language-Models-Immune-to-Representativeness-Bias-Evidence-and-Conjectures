To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the given population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

We define:
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black. (15%)
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white. (85%)

The witness's identification accuracy is given as:
- \( P(\text{Identifies as black} | B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{Identifies as black} | W) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identifies as black} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Identifies as black})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black}) = P(\text{Identifies as black} | B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{Identifies as black} | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(B) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black} | B) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black} | W) = 0.20 \]

Calculate \( P(\text{Identifies as black}) \):
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identifies as black}) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) \):
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identifies as black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
