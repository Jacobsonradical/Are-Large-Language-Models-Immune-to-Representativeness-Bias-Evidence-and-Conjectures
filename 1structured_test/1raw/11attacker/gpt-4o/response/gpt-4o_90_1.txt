To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(ID_b | B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(ID_b | W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(ID_b) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, we need to outline the prior probabilities and conditional probabilities:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(ID_b | B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(ID_b | W) = 0.20 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B | ID_b) = \frac{P(ID_b | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_b)} \]

To find \( P(ID_b) \):

\[ P(ID_b) = P(ID_b | B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_b | W) \cdot P(W) \]

So:

\[ P(ID_b) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID_b) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID_b) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | ID_b) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_b) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_b) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.

The final format:

  probability: 0.414
