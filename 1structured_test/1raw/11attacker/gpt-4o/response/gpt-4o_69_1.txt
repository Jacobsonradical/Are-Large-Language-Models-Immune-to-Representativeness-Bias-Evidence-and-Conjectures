To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (since the witness is correct 80% of the time for identifying black attackers)
- \( P(W|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time and incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now, \( P(W) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., being white):
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \]

So:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
