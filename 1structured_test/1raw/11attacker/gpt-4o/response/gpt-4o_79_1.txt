To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( \bar{B} \): The event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\bar{B}) = 0.85 \) (since the complement of being black is being white)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W | \bar{B}) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white)

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(B | W) \) that the attacker is black given the witness identifies the attacker as black. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | \bar{B}) \cdot P(\bar{B})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[ 
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' formula:

\[ 
P(B | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
