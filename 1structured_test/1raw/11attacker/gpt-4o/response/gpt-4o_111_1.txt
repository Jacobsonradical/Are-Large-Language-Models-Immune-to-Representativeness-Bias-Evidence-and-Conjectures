To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability of the attacker being black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability of the attacker being white).

We also know the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black).
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
