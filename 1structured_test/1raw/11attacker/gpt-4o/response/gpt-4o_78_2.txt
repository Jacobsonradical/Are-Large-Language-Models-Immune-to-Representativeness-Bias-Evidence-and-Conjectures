To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the notation and the steps to find the probability:

- \( P(B) \): Probability attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability attacker is white.
- \( P(E | B) \): Probability witness identifies attacker as black given attacker is black.
- \( P(E | W) \): Probability witness identifies attacker as black given attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability witness identifies attacker as black.

From the problem:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \)

We need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | B)P(B) + P(E | W)P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
