To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem can be stated as follows:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, we need to define the various probabilities:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is black)
2. \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3. \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is \( 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \)
4. \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (considering the witness's mistake rate)

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is black. This can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
