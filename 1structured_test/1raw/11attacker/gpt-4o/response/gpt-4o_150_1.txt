To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = \) probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|White) \cdot P(White) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
