To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (here, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Here's how we break it down:

1. Prior Probability (Base Rate):
   - Probability the attacker is black (\( P(B) \)) = 0.15
   - Probability the attacker is white (\( P(W) \)) = 0.85

2. Witness's Identification Reliability:
   - Probability the witness correctly identifies a black person (\( P(I \mid B) \)) = 0.80
   - Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a black person when they are actually white (\( P(I \mid W) \)) = 0.20
   
3. We need the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (\( P(I) \)). This is calculated as:
\[ P(I) = P(I \mid B) * P(B) + P(I \mid W) * P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

4. Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability (\( P(B \mid I) \)):
\[ P(B \mid I) = \frac{P(I \mid B) * P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B \mid I) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid I) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
