To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black
- \( W \): The attacker is white
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's find these probabilities:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
2. \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Given the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies black)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies white as black)

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
