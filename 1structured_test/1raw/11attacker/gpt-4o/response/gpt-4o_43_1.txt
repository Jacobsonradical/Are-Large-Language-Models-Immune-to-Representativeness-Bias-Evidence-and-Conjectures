To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( I_B \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that an attacker chosen at random is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that an attacker chosen at random is white)
- \( P(I_B | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- \( P(I_B | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

We need to calculate \( P(B | I_B) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(I_B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B | I_B) \):

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | I_B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
