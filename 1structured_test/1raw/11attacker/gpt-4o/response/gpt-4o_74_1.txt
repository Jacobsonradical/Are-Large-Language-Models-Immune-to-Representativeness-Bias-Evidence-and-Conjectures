To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E_B \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E_B | B) = 0.8 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(E_B | W) = 0.2 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(B | E_B) \), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. 

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{P(E_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E_B)} \]

where \( P(E_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E_B) = P(E_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E_B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
