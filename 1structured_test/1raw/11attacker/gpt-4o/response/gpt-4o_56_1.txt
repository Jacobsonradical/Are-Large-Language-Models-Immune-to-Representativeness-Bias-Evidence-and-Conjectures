To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as black when they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the population statistics.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W') = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
