To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification under the specified conditions, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) represent the event that the attacker is white.

From the given information:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is \( P(\text{ID} = B | B) = 0.80 \), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is \( P(\text{ID} = B | W) = 0.20 \).

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black, \( P(B | \text{ID} = B) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | \text{ID} = B) = \frac{P(\text{ID} = B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{ID} = B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{ID} = B) \):

\[ P(\text{ID} = B) = P(\text{ID} = B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{ID} = B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

\[ P(\text{ID} = B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(\text{ID} = B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(\text{ID} = B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | \text{ID} = B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | \text{ID} = B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B | \text{ID} = B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
