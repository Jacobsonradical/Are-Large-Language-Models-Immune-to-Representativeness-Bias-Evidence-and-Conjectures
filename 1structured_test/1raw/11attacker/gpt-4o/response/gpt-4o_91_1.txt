To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how the calculation goes:

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white).
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker).
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. By Bayes' Theorem, this is:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
