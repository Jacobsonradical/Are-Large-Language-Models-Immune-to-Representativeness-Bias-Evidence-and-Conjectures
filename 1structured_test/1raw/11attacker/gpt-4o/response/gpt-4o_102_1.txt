To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is stated as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black.

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that any given person in the city is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person).
- \( P(W|W') = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

To find \( P(W) \), we can use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]

Where:
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (probability that any given person in the city is white).

So,

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
