To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

We define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are interested in \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, letâ€™s calculate \( P(E|B) \) and \( P(E|W) \):
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)

Next, \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \) are the prior probabilities:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Now, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
