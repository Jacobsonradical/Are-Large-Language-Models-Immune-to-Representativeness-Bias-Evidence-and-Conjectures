To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence.

We define the following terms:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker.
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person is black)
2. \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person is white)
3. \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
4. \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
