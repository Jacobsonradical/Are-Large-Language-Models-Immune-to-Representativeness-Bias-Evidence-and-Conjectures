To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black
- \( W \): The attacker is white
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies black person as black 80% of the time)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black. This includes both cases: the attacker is actually black and the attacker is actually white.

\[
P(E) = P(E | B) P(B) + P(E | W) P(W)
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(B | E) \):

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \}
\]
