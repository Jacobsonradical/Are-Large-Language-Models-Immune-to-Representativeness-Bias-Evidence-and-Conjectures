To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black individual as black)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white individual as black)

We want to calculate \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(B | E) \):

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
