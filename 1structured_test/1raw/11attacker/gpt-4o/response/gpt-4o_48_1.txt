To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. Define the events:
   - \( B \): The attacker is black.
   - \( W \): The attacker is white.
   - \( I_b \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is white)
   - \( P(I_b | B) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
   - \( P(I_b | W) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

3. Bayesâ€™ Theorem formula:
   \[
   P(B | I_b) = \frac{P(I_b | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_b)}
   \]

4. Calculate \( P(I_b) \):
   \[
   P(I_b) = P(I_b | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_b | W) \cdot P(W)
          = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
          = 0.12 + 0.17
          = 0.29
   \]

5. Calculate \( P(B | I_b) \):
   \[
   P(B | I_b) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
              = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
              \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is approximately 0.4138.
