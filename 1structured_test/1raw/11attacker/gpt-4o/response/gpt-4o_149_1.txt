To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's set up the problem with the provided information:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black (given that the attacker is actually black).
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black (given that the attacker is actually white).

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.4138} \]
