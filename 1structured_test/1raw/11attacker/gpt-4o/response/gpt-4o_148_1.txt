To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B)P(B)}{P(W)}\]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness said they are black.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \(P(W)\) is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is black.

First, we note:
- \(P(B)\) (the prior probability that the attacker is black) is 0.15.
- \(P(W|B)\) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given they are black) is 0.80.

We also need to account for the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black:
- \(P(W|W')\) is the probability that the witness says an attacker is black given that they are actually white, which is 0.20.

Next, we calculate \(P(W)\), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black:
\[P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|W')P(W')\]
where \(P(W')\) is the probability that the attacker is white (1 - P(B)) = 0.85.

Plugging in the values:
\[P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)\]
\[P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(W) = 0.29\]

Now we can calculate \(P(B|W)\):
\[P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B)P(B)}{P(W)}\]

\[P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(B|W) \approx 0.4138\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
