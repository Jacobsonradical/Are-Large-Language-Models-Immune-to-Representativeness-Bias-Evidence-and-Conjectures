To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that a person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black.

Let's define the probabilities based on the given data:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Here:

- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being white)

Calculating \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:

{probability: 0.4138}
