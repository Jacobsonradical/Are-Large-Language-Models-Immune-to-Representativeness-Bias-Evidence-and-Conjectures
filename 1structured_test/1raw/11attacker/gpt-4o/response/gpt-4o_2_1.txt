To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of an event occurring based on new information. In this case, we need to find the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A_B \): Attacker is black.
- \( A_W \): Attacker is white.
- \( W_B \): Witness identifies the attacker as black.
  
We are given:
- The prior probabilities:
  - \( P(A_B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
  - \( P(A_W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

- The witness's reliability:
  - \( P(W_B \mid A_B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
  - \( P(W_B \mid A_W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find \( P(A_B \mid W_B) \):

\[
P(A_B \mid W_B) = \frac{P(W_B \mid A_B) \cdot P(A_B)}{P(W_B)}
\]

First, find \( P(W_B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[
P(W_B) = P(W_B \mid A_B) \cdot P(A_B) + P(W_B \mid A_W) \cdot P(A_W)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(W_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute \( P(W_B) \) back into Bayes' Theorem equation:

\[
P(A_B \mid W_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A_B \mid W_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
