To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification,
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person,
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any attacker is black (based on the population statistics),
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, we identify the necessary probabilities from the information provided:

1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that any person in the city is black),
2. \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person),
3. \( P(W|W') = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we can use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]

Where \( P(W') \) is the probability that the attacker is white:

\[ P(W') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

So,

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
