To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Here, our hypothesis \( H \) is that the attacker is black, and the evidence \( E \) is that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Letâ€™s define these probabilities based on the given information:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black, which is 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black, which is 0.80.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability the attacker is white, which is 0.85.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white, which is 0.20.

We need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the known probabilities:

\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately \( 0.414 \).
