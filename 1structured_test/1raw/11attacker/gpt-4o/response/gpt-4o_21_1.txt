To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step calculation:

### Definitions and Given Data

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E | B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 0.80.
- \( P(E | W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black = 0.20.
- \( P(E) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- City population distribution:
  - \( P(B') = 15\% = 0.15 \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black.
  - \( P(W') = 85\% = 0.85 \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white.

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) = P(B') = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = P(W') = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \)

Let's first calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B | E) \):
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
