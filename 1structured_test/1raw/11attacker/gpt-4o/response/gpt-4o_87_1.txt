To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(E | B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time: \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being black: \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:

- \( P(E | W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being white: \( P(W) = 0.85 \).

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
