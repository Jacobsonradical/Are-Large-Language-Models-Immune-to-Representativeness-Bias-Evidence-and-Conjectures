To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Here's how we can set it up:

- Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \( W \) represent the event that the attacker is white.
- Let \( I_b \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person is black in the city)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is white in the city)
- \( P(I_b | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black individual)
- \( P(I_b | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white individual as black)

We want to find \( P(B | I_b) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | I_b) = \frac{P(I_b | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_b)} \]

First, calculate \( P(I_b) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(I_b) = P(I_b | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_b | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I_b) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_b) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_b) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | I_b) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_b) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_b) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
