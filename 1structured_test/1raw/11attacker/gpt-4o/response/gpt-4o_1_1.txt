To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white)

We aim to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can plug \( P(E) \) into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.41} \}
\]
