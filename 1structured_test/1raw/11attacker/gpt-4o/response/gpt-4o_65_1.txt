To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Define the events:
   - \( B \): The attacker is black.
   - \( W \): The attacker is white.
   - \( I_B \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. Convert the given probabilities to mathematical notation:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
   - \( P(I_B | B) = 0.8 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
   - \( P(I_B | W) = 0.2 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

3. Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B | I_B) \):
   \[
   P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W)}
   \]

4. Calculate the denominator \( P(I_B) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black:
   \[
   P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W)
   \]
   \[
   P(I_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. Plug in the values:
   \[
   P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B | I_B) \approx 0.414
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
