To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|B) \) is 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(B) \) is 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is black).
- \( P(W|W) \) is 0.20 (the witness falsely identifies a white person as black, since they err 20% of the time).
- \( P(W) \) is 0.85 (the prior probability that a person is white).

Now, substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Then, we can calculate \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
