To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population demographics.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)
- \( P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \) (total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

First, we compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
