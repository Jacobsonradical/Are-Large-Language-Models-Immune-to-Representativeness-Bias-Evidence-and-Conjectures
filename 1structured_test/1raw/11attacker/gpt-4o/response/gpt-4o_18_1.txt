To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) - The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) - The event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) - The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white).
- \( P(I | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker).
- \( P(I | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).

We need to find \( P(B | I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Where \( P(I) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(I) = P(I | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
