To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The prior probability of an attacker being black or white in the city.
2. The accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is black.
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white.

We need to find \( P(B | E) \): The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B | E) \):
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
