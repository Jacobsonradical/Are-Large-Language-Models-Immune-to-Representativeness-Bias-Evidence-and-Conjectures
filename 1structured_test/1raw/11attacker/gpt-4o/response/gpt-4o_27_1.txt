To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given:
- The base rate of the population: \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (black), \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (white).
- The witness's accuracy: \( P(ID = B | B) = 0.80 \), \( P(ID = W | B) = 0.20 \), \( P(ID = W | W) = 0.80 \), \( P(ID = B | W) = 0.20 \).

We are interested in \( P(B | ID = B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | ID = B) = \frac{P(ID = B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID = B)} \]

To find \( P(ID = B) \):

\[ P(ID = B) = P(ID = B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID = B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(ID = B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID = B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID = B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(B | ID = B) \):

\[ P(B | ID = B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID = B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID = B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.414.
