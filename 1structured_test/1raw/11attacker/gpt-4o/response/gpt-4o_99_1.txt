To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification and the provided population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We need to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
