To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( S \) as the event that the witness says the attacker is black.

We need to find \( P(B|S) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|S) = \frac{P(S|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(S)} \]

Where:
- \( P(S|B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(S) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black.

First, compute each term:

1. **\( P(S|B) \)**:
   - The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so \( P(S|B) = 0.80 \).

2. **\( P(B) \)**:
   - The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the city's population distribution, is \( P(B) = 0.15 \).

3. **\( P(S) \)**:
   - This is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black, which we find using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(S) = P(S|B) \cdot P(B) + P(S|W) \cdot P(W)
   \]
   - \( P(S|W) \): The probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually white. This would be the error rate for identifying a white person as black, which is 20% of the time (since they correctly identify a white person 80% of the time). So, \( P(S|W) = 0.20 \).
   - \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white, given the city's population distribution, is \( P(W) = 0.85 \).

Now, compute \( P(S) \):

\[ P(S) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.29 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|S) = \frac{P(S|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(S)} \]
\[ P(B|S) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|S) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|S) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
