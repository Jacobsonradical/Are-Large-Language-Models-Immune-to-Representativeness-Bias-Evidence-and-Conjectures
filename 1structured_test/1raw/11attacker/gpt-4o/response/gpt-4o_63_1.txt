To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let \( B \) denote the event that the attacker is black, and let \( W \) denote the event that the attacker is white. Let \( E \) denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The quantities we need are as follows:
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white, which is 20% or 0.20.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Substituting the given values,

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem,

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B|E) \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
