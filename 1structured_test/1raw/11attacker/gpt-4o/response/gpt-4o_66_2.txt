To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here's the breakdown of the information we have:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E | B) \): The probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly, given that the attacker is actually black, is 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(E | W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is 20% or 0.20.

We want to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black (whether correctly or incorrectly). This can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B | E) \):
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
