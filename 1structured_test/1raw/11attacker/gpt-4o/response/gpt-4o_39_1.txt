To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes’ theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. In this case, we need to calculate \(P(B|W)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness’s identification.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \(P(W)\) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black)
- \(P(W|B) = 0.80\) (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \(P(W|W) = 0.20\) (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \(P(W') = 0.20\) (witness correctly identifies a white person 80% of the time)
- \(P(W|W') = 0.20\) (witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time)

First, we need to find \(P(W)\), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
