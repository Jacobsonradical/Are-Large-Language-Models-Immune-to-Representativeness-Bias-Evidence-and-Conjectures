To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we need to account for the reliability of the witness and the base rates of races in the city's population.

First, let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( \text{IDB} \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find the probability \( P(B|\text{IDB}) \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(B|\text{IDB}) = \frac{P(\text{IDB}|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{IDB})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{IDB}|B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(\text{IDB}) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

To find \( P(\text{IDB}) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{IDB}) = P(\text{IDB}|B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{IDB}|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{IDB}|W) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white, which is 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).

Let's plug in the numbers:

\[
P(\text{IDB}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(\text{IDB}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can update our estimate with Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|\text{IDB}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
