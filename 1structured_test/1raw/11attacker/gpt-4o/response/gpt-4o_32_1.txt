To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is white)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, i.e., 1 minus the probability of correctly identifying a white person, which is 80%)

Firstly, let's calculate the total probability that a witness identifies someone as black, \( P_W \):

\[ P_W = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P_W = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P_W = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P_W = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P_W} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
