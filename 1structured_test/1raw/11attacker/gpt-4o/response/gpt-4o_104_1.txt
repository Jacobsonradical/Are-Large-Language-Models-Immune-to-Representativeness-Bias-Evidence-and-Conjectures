To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll be calculating the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( ID_{black} \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B | ID_{black}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B | ID_{black}) = \frac{P(ID_{black} | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_{black})} \]

1. Calculate \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \):
\[ P(B) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.85 \]

2. Calculate \( P(ID_{black} | B) \) and \( P(ID_{black} | W) \):
\[ P(ID_{black} | B) = 0.80 \] (The probability the witness correctly identified a black attacker)
\[ P(ID_{black} | W) = 0.20 \] (The probability the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black)

3. Calculate \( P(ID_{black}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(ID_{black}) = P(ID_{black} | B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_{black} | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(ID_{black}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID_{black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID_{black}) = 0.29 \]

4. Finally, calculate \( P(B | ID_{black}) \):
\[ P(B | ID_{black}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_{black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_{black}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
