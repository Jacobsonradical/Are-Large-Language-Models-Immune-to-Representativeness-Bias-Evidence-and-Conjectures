To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( \text{Witness identifies black} \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B \mid \text{Witness identifies black}) \).

First, let's define the known probabilities:

1. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. \( P(\text{Witness identifies black} \mid B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 80% or 0.8.
4. \( P(\text{Witness identifies black} \mid W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

We need \( P(\text{Witness identifies black}) \), which can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Witness identifies black}) = P(\text{Witness identifies black} \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(\text{Witness identifies black} \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(\text{Witness identifies black}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness identifies black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness identifies black}) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B \mid \text{Witness identifies black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness identifies black} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Witness identifies black})} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B \mid \text{Witness identifies black}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{Witness identifies black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{Witness identifies black}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.
