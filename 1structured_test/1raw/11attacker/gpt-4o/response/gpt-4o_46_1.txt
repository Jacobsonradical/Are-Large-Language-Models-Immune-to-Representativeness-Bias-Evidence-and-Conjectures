To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem can be written as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the population distribution).
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as black.

Given the problem, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of attacker being black)
- \( P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \) (total probability of witness identifying a person as black)

Since 85% of the population is white:
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
  
Calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately \(0.41\).
