To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \(B\) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \(I_B\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information:

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
2. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

We need to calculate \(P(B|I_B)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[P(B|I_B) = \frac{P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)}\]

Where:

- \(P(I_B|B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \(P(I_B)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Let's define each term:

1. \(P(I_B|B) = 0.80\)
2. \(P(B) = 0.15\)
3. \(P(I_B|W) = 0.20\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
4. \(P(W) = 0.85\)

Now, to find \(P(I_B)\):

\[P(I_B) = P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B|W) \cdot P(W)\]

Substitute the values:

\[P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)\]
\[P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(I_B) = 0.29\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(B|I_B) \approx 0.4138\]

Rounding to four decimal places:

\[P(B|I_B) = 0.4138\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
