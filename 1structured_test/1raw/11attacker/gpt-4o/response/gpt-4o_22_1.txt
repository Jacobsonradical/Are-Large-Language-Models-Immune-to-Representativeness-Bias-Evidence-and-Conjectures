To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is black),
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is white),
- \( P(I_B | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person),
- \( P(I_B | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

We need to find \( P(B | I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

To find \( P(I_B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the demographic information, is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
