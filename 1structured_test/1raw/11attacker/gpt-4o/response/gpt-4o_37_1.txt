To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we solve this step-by-step:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
   - Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Probabilities given:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is white)
   - \( P(E | B) = 0.8 \) (probability of identification as black given the attacker is black)
   - \( P(E | W) = 0.2 \) (probability of identification as black given the attacker is white, since witness errs 20% of the time)

3. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**
   \( P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \)

   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(B | E) \) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
   \]
   
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification as black is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the estimate is:
\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
