To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(I_B|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, we calculate \( P(I_B|B) \) and \( P(I_B|W) \):
- \( P(I_B|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).
- \( P(I_B|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Next, we use the population distribution to find \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \):
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

Now, we calculate \( P(I_B) \):
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(B|I_B) \):
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{P(I_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
