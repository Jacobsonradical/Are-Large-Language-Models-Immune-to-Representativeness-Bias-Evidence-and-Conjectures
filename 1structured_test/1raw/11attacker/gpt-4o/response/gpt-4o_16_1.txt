To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the city's demographic information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, we determine each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(B) \):**
   Given the city's demographic, \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(W) \):**
   \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|B) \):**
   The witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals is 80%, so \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(E|W) \):**
   The witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a white individual as black is 20%, so \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(E) \):**
   Using the law of total probability, we calculate \( P(E) \) as follows:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

Now we can find \( P(B|E) \):
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the city's demographics is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \}
\]
