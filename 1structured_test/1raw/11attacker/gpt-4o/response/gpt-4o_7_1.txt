To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the provided information, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the provided information:
1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
2. \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
3. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time: \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \).
4. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time: \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \).

Now we can find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the provided information is:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
