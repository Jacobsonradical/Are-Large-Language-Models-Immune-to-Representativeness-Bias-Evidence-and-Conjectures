To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is a powerful tool for updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events for clarity:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to calculate \( P(B | I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(I_B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Given the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(I_B | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(I_B | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now substitute these values into the equation for \( P(I_B) \):
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Next, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately {probability: 0.414}.
