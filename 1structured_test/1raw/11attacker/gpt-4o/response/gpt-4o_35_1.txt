To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as black.

Given the information:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(W|W') = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, where \(W'\) is white)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of a person being black)
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (prior probability of a person being white)

First, we calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
