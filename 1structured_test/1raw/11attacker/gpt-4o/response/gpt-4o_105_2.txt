To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step calculation:

Let:
- \( P(B) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(E|W) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white.
- \( P(E) \) be the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \)

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|E) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.41} \} \]
