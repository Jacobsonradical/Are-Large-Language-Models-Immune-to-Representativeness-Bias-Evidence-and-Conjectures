To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
