To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20% or 0.2).

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities based on the population distribution:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

Next, we need to find the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black \( P(E) \). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]

Substituting the values in:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black \( P(B|E) \):

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Substituting the values in:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
