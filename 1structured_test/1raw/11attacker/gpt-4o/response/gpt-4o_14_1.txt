To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the definitions for the variables involved:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(E|W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white.
- \( P(E) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (Since if the attacker is white, the witness gets it wrong 20% of the time and identifies them as black)

We want to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Calculating:

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
