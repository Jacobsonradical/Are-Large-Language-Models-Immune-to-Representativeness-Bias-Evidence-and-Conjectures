Given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Let's define the events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( T \): The witness testifies that the attacker is black.

From the information, we know the following:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white)
- \( P(T|B) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the race if the person is black)
- \( P(T|W) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the race if the person is white)

We are interested in \( P(B|T) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|T) = \frac{P(T|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(T)} \]

To find \( P(T) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(T) = P(T|B) \cdot P(B) + P(T|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the known values:

\[ P(T) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|T) \):

\[ P(B|T) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|T) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|T) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
