We can use Bayes' theorem to update our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a random person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
  
\[ P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|W)P(W) \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is:

\[ P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|W) \):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.41}
