To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of an event (the attacker being black, in this case) based on new evidence (the witness identification).

Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We're looking to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to find each component in the right-hand side of the equation:

1. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
   Given in the problem: 15% of the population is black.
   \[
   P(B) = 0.15
   \]

2. \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
   Given in the problem: 85% of the population is white.
   \[
   P(W) = 0.85
   \]

3. \( P(E|B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
   Given in the problem: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
   \[
   P(E|B) = 0.80
   \]

4. \( P(E|W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
   Given in the problem: The witness erred 20% of the time, so they would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.
   \[
   P(E|W) = 0.20
   \]

5. \( P(E) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
