To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white. 

Given the probabilities:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the probability a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (the probability a randomly chosen person in the city is white)
- \( P(E \mid B) = 0.80 \) (the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(E \mid W) = 0.20 \) (the probability the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

We seek \( P(B \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid B) P(B)}{P(E \mid B) P(B) + P(E \mid W) P(W)} \]

Substitute the given probabilities:

\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[ \text{Numerator} = 0.80 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ \text{Denominator} = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
