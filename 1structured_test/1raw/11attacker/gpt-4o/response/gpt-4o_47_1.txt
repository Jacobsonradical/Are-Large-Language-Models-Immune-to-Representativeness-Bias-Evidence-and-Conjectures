To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we need to determine the posterior probability (\(P(B|W)\)) that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Here's the information we have:
- \(P(W|B) = 0.80\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as black when they are black.
- \(P(W|W) = 0.20\): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black when they are white.
- \(P(B) = 0.15\): The prior probability that a person in the city is black.
- \(P(W) = 0.85\): The prior probability that a person in the city is white.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \(P(W)\) can be found with the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Applying the numbers we get:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \(P(B|W)\):
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately \(0.4138\).

Thus, the answer is:
\{
  "probability": 0.4138
