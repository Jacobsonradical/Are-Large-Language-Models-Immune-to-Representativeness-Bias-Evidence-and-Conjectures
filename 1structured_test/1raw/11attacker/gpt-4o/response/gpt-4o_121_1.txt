To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given witness identification and demographic information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

**Definitions:**
- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

**Given:**
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (Probability of witness identifying a black attacker correctly).
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black).

**To find:** \( P(B|E) \) (Probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified black).

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

We first need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information is approximately 0.4138.

**Formatted Answer:**
{probability: 0.4138}
