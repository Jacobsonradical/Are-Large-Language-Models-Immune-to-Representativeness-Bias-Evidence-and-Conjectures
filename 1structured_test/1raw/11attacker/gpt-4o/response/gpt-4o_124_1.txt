To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states the following:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A occurring given event B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B occurring given event A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

Let:
- \( A \) = the attacker is black,
- \( B \) = the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- The witness's accuracy \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \),
- The probability of a person being black in the population \( P(A) = 0.15 \),
- The probability of a person being white in the population \( P(\overline{A}) = 0.85 \).

The witness errors 20% of the time, so:
- \( P(B|\overline{A}) = 0.2 \), where \( \overline{A} \) represents the attacker being white.

First, we need to compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\overline{A}) \cdot P(\overline{A}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138. 

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
