To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We're given:

- \( P(B) \): Prior probability that the attacker is black (\( 0.15 \) since 15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W) \): Prior probability that the attacker is white (\( 0.85 \) since 85% of the population is white).
- \( P(E | B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (\( 0.80 \)).
- \( P(E | W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white (\( 0.20 \)).

We want to find \( P(B | E) \): The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, and it can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
