To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification and the population data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

- The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying someone's race and a 20% error rate.
- 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( ID_B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to calculate \( P(B \mid ID_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{P(ID_B \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(ID_B) \):

\[ P(ID_B) = P(ID_B \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_B \mid W) \cdot P(W) \]

Given:
- \( P(ID_B \mid B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(ID_B \mid W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (the probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (the probability that the attacker is white)

Plugging these values in:

\[ P(ID_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B \mid ID_B) \):

\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid ID_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid ID_B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
