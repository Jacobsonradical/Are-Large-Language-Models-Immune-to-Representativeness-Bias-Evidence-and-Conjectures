To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

We have the following information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white.
- \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.

Hence, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
