To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's find each term:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \):**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E | B) \) and \( P(E | W) \):**
   - \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
   - \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

3. **Total probability \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
\{probability: 0.414\}
