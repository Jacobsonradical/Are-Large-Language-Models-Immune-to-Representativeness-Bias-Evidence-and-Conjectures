To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let's denote the following events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is white)

2. **Likelihoods (based on the witness's accuracy):**
   - \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
   - \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

3. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \):**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Posterior probability \( P(B|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B|E) \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
