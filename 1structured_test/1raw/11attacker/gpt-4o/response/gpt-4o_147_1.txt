To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and other provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E_B \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white).
- \( P(E_B | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is black).
- \( P(E_B | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white).

We want to find \( P(B | E_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{P(E_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E_B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E_B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E_B) = P(E_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E_B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B | E_B) \):

\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E_B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, the answer in the specified format is:
