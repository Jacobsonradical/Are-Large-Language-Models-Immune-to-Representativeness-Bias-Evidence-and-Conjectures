To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:

- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find \( P(B|E) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

1. \( P(B) \) is given by the proportion of the cityâ€™s population:
\[ P(B) = 0.15 \]

2. \( P(E|B) \) is given by the witness's accuracy in identifying a black person:
\[ P(E|B) = 0.8 \]

3. \( P(E|W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which corresponds to the witness making a mistake:
\[ P(E|W) = 0.2 \]

4. \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is white:
\[ P(W) = 0.85 \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

So,
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
