To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(\neg B) \): Probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).
- \( P(W|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W|\neg B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(W) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
- The prior probabilities: 
  \( P(B) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \).
- The witness's accuracy:
  \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W|\neg B) = 0.20 \).

We want to compute \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. By Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|\neg B) \cdot P(\neg B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
