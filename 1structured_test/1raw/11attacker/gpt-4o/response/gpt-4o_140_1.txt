To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief with new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( I \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white)

We need to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Where \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Accordingly, the answer can be presented as:
{probability: 0.4138}
