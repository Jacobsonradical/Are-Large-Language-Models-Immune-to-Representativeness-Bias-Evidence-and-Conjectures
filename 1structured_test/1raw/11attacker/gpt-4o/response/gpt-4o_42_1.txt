To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's break down the information we have:

**Prior Information:**
- 85% of the population is white.
- 15% of the population is black.

**Witness Information:**
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

We want to find \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15)
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (0.80)
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (0.20, since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.414
\]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately \( 0.414 \).

Hence, the answer is:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
