To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- \( P(Black) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(White) = 0.85 \)
- The witness's accuracy:
  - \( P(Identified|Black) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(Identified|White) = 0.20 \) (since the witness erred 20% of the time)

We are trying to find \( P(Black | Identified) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(Black | Identified) = \frac{P(Identified | Black) \cdot P(Black)}{P(Identified)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(Identified) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[ P(Identified) = P(Identified | Black) \cdot P(Black) + P(Identified | White) \cdot P(White) \]
\[ P(Identified) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(Identified) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(Identified) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(Black | Identified) \):

\[ P(Black | Identified) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Black | Identified) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Black | Identified) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
