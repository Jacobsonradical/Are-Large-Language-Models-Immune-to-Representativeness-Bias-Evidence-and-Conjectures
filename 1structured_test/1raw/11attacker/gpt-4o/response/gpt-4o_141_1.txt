To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \(B\): The attacker is black.
- \(W\): The attacker is white.
- \(E\): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white)

The reliability of the witness is:
- \(P(E|B) = 0.8\) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \(P(E|W) = 0.2\) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We need to find \(P(B|E)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}\]

First, we need to calculate \(P(E)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)\]

Substituting the given values:

\[P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)\]

\[P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\]

Now we can calculate \(P(B|E)\):

\[P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately \(0.414\).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
