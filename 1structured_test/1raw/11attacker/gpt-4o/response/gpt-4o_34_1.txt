To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(E | B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(B | E) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
