To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that an attacker is black before considering the witness’s identification.
2. \( P(W) \): The prior probability that an attacker is white before considering the witness’s identification.
3. \( P(ID|B) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
4. \( P(ID|W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
5. \( P(ID) \): The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Based on the information provided:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(ID|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is black)
- \( P(ID|W) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white)

First, we find the total probability \( P(ID) \):

\[ P(ID) = P(ID|B)P(B) + P(ID|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(ID) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(ID) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|ID) \):

\[ P(B|ID) = \frac{P(ID|B)P(B)}{P(ID)} \]
\[ P(B|ID) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|ID) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|ID) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, considering the population distribution and the witness’s accuracy, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
