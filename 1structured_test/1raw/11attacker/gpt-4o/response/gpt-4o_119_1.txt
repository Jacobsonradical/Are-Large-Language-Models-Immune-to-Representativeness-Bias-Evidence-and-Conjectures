To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Given:

1. \(P(\text{Black}) = 0.15\) (prior probability)
2. \(P(\text{White}) = 0.85\) (prior probability)
3. \(P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) = 0.80\) (witness's correct identification rate)
4. \(P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{White}) = 0.20\) (witness's error rate)

First, we calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

\(P(\text{Identified as Black}) = P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{White}) \times P(\text{White})\)

Specifically:

\[P(\text{Identified as Black}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)\]
\[P(\text{Identified as Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(\text{Identified as Black}) = 0.29\]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

\[P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Black} | \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identified as Black})}\]

Substituting in the values:

\[P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(\text{Black} | \text{Identified as Black}) \approx 0.4138\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
