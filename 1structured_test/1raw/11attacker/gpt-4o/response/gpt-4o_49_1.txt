Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Here's the detailed process:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \(B\): The attacker is black.
   - \(W\): The attacker is white.
   - \(E\): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Extract the probabilities:**
   - \(P(B) = 0.15\) (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the population).
   - \(P(W) = 0.85\) (the prior probability that the attacker is white based on the population).
   - \(P(E | B) = 0.80\) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
   - \(P(E | W) = 0.20\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, since the witness errs 20% of the time).

3. **Bayes' Theorem formula:**
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \(P(E)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black, which can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W)
   \]

4. **Calculate \(P(E)\):**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.

\[
\text{{probability: 0.414}}
\]
