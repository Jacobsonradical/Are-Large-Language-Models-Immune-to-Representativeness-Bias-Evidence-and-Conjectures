To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black.

Given the information:
- The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, so \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \).
- The probability that a random person in the population is black, \( P(B) \), is 15% or 0.15.
- The probability that a random person in the population is white, \( P(W') \), is 85% or 0.85.
- The witness can misidentify the race 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, \( P(W|W') \), is 0.2.

We need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
