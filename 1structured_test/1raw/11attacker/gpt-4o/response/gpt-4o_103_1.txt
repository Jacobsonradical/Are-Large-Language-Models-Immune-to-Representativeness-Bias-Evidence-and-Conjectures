To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_b \) as the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (probability of the attacker being black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability of the attacker being white)
- \( P(I_b|B) = 0.80 \) (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- \( P(I_b|W) = 0.20 \) (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black)

We aim to find \( P(B|I_b) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|I_b) = \frac{P(I_b|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_b)} \]

First, we must calculate \( P(I_b) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(I_b) = P(I_b|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_b|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(I_b) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_b) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_b) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|I_b) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_b) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_b) \approx 0.414 \]

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
