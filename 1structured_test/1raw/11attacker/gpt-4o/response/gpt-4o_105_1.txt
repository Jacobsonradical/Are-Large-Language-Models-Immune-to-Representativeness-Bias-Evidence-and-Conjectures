To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the given information about the population and the witness's accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that the attacker is black.
- \(B\) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's determine each component of Bayes' Theorem.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**:
   The probability that a random person in the city is black:
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \]

2. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)**:
   The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]

3. **Total Probability \(P(B)\)**:
   The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, considering both the cases where the attacker is actually black and where the attacker is actually white.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   Where \(P(B|\neg A)\) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black, and \(P(\neg A)\) is the probability that the attacker is white.

   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \]
   \[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \]

   Thus,
   \[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

4. **Posterior Probability \(P(A|B)\)**:
   Finally, using Bayes' Theorem,
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
