To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs (the base rates of the population) based on new evidence (the witness identification).

Here are the components:

- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is black (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the attacker is white (85% or 0.85).
- \( P(I|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(I|W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white (20% or 0.2).

We want to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I)} \]

We first need to find \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \cdot P(B) + P(I|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(I) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B|I) \):

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.

So, the result in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
