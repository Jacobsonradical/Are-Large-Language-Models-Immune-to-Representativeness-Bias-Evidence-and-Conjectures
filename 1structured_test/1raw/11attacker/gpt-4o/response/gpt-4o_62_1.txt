To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to calculate \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

1. \( P(E|B) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 0.8
2. \( P(E|W) \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black = 0.2 (since the witness has a 20% error rate and might mistakenly identify a white attacker as black).
3. \( P(B) \): Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15
4. \( P(W) \): Prior probability of the attacker being white = 0.85

Now, we need to find \( P(E) \), which is the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately:
