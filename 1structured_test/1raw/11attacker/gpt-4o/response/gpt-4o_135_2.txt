To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies black 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies white as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Let:
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (percentage of population that is white)

Then:
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{12}{29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is about 0.41.

Therefore, the response is:
{probability: 0.41}
