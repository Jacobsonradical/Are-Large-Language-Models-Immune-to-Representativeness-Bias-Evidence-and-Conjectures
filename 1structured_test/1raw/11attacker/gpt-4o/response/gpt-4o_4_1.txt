To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \): The probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \): The probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is white.
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug \( P(E) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
