To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s how we calculate it step-by-step:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( B \): The attacker is black.
   - \( W \): The attacker is white.
   - \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
   - \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
   - \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

3. **Calculate the Total Probability of E (the witness identifying the attacker as black):**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Calculate the Probability that the Attacker is Black given the Witness’s Identification (Bayes' Theorem):**
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138\}
\]
