To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we use the given information:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
- \( P(E|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now substitute \( P(E) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
