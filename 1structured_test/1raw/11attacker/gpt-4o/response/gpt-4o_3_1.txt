To solve this, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. We'll denote the following:

- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E | B) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(E | W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \)

We need to calculate \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

{probability: 0.4138}
