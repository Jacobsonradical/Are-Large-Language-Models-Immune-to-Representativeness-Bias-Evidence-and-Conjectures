To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the formulation:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness would identify someone as black.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
