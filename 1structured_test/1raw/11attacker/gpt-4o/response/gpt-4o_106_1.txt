To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Define the events:
   - \( B \) : the attacker is black
   - \( W \) : the attacker is white
   - \( E \) : the witness identifies the attacker as black

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(B) \) = 0.15 (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
   - \( P(W) \) = 0.85 (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white)
   - \( P(E|B) \) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
   - \( P(E|W) \) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

3. We need to find \( P(B|E) \) (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|E) \):

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
