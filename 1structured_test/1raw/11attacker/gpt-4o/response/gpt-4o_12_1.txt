To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( B \): The event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \): The event that the attacker is white.
- \( ID_B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to determine \( P(B | ID_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | ID_B) = \frac{P(ID_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(ID_B)} \]

First, let's calculate each term:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \)**:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(ID_B | B) \)** and \( P(ID_B | W) \)**:
   - \( P(ID_B | B) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(ID_B | W) = 0.20 \)

3. **Total Probability \( P(ID_B) \)**:
   - \( P(ID_B) = P(ID_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(ID_B | W) \cdot P(W) \)
   - \( P(ID_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \)
   - \( P(ID_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \)
   - \( P(ID_B) = 0.29 \)

Now we can plug in these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | ID_B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID_B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
