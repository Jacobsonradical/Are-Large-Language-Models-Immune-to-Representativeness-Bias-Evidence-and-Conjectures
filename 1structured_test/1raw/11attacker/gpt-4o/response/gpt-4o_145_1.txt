Let's denote the following events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( \neg B \): The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find \( P(B | W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness says the attacker is black. We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to determine each component:

1. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black.
2. \( P(W | B) \): The likelihood that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that they are black.
3. \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg B) = 0.20 \) (witness erroneously identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | \neg B) \cdot P(\neg B) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
