To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( B \): The attacker is black.
- \( W \): The attacker is white.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is white)
- \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(B | E) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \cdot P(B) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
