To find the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black." We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4091 or 40.91%

However, since the question asks for the probability in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, the answer should be:

{probability: 0.4091}
