To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, in this case, the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black (A) and the event that the attacker is black (B). We are interested in finding the probability of B given A, denoted as P(B|A).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / P(A), where:

1. P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
2. P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 0.15 (15%).
3. P(A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's true race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which states that P(A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B). We are given P(A|B) and P(B), and we know that P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (85%). However, we do not have P(A|not B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 (20%) in the problem description, which represents the witness's error rate when identifying the race of a non-black person.

Now we can calculate P(A):
P(A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|A):
P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / P(A)
= [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138
