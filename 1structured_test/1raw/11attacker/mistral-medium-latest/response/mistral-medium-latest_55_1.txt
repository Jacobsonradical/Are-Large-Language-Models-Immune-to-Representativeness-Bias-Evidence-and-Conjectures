To approach this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

P(B|A) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony (event A)
P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (before considering the testimony)
P(A|B) as the probability of the witness testimony given that the attacker is black
P(A|¬B) as the probability of the witness testimony given that the attacker is not black
P(¬B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

From the information provided:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)
P(A|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(A|¬B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.409

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.409.

{probability: 0.409}
