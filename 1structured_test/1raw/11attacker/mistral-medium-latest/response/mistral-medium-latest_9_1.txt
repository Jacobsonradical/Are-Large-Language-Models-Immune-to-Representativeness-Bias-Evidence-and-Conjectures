To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event B).

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (before any evidence)
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (before any information about the attacker's race)

From the problem statement, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B). We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
      = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white), we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.21

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.5714

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.5714.
