{probability: 0.47}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We need to consider both the prior probability (information a) and the witness's testimony (information b).
2. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
3. Let P(B) be the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (information a).
4. Let P(~B) be the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (information a).
5. Let P(W|B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 (information b).
6. Let P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 (information b).
7. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
8. Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)].
9. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.47.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.47.
