To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a person being black in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(W) as the prior probability of a person being white in the city, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(C|B) as the conditional probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.
P(C|W) as the conditional probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2.

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|C), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(B|C) â‰ˆ 0.395 or 39.5%

However, this estimate does not consider the prior probability of an attacker being black in the population. If the attack rate is similar for all races, then our estimate would be approximately 39.5%. But if the attack rate is different among races, then the prior probability of an attacker being black might need to be adjusted. Without this information, it's hard to give a more precise estimate.
