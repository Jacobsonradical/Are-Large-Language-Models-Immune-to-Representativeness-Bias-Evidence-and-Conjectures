To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event A) given that the witness identified them as black (event B).

First, let's define the probabilities:

P(A) = Prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from the information given)
P(~A) = Prior probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85 (1 - P(A))
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person = 0.80 (from the information given)
P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black = 0.20 (from the information given)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.394

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.394.
