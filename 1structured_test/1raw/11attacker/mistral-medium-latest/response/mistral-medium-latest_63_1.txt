To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs (in this case, the racial demographics of the city) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let:
P(B) be the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15.
P(W|B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8.
P(W|¬B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2.
P(¬B) be the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.409 or 40.9%

However, since we are asked to provide a probability between 0 and 1:
{probability: 0.409}
