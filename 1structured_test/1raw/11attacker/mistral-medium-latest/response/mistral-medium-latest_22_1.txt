To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (H) being true given some evidence (E). It is defined as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

In this problem, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (H) given the witness testimony (E). We can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(attacker is black|witness testimony) = [P(witness testimony|attacker is black) \* P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness testimony|attacker is black) \* P(attacker is black) + P(witness testimony|attacker is not black) \* P(attacker is not black)]

From the problem statement, we know the following probabilities:

P(witness testimony|attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(attacker is not black) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

However, we still need to find P(witness testimony|attacker is not black), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is white, we can estimate this probability as follows:

P(witness testimony|attacker is not black) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black|witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(attacker is black|witness testimony) â‰ˆ 0.346

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.346.
