To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Where:

- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black (B) given the witness's identification (A)
- P(A|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%)
- P(¬B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85%)
- P(A|¬B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (20%)

Plugging in the values:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) ≈ 0.3947

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.3947, or 39.47%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.3947}
