{probability: 0.47}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony.
2. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B) and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W). We are given that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
3. Let's denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as E. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
4. According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)].
5. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|B) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(E|W) = 0.2.
6. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.47.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is 0.47.
