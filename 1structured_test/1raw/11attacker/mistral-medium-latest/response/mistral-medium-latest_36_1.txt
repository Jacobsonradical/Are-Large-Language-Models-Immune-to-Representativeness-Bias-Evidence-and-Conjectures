To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)).

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the population demographics.
* P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate.
* P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.
* P(not B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 based on the population demographics.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W) as:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [(0.8 \* 0.15)] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.395.

{probability: 0.395}
