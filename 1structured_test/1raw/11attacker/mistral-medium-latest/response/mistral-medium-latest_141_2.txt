To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)).

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., being white), which is 0.85 (from information a).
P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are not black (i.e., they are white), which is 0.2 (from information b).

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.

{probability: 0.41}
