To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (what we want to find).
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that they are black, which is 0.8.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that they are not black (i.e., white), which is 0.2.
- P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [(0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))]

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.397
