To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(Black | Witness ID)).

First, let's define some probabilities:

1. P(Black) = probability of a random person in the city being black = 0.15 (from information a)
2. P(White) = probability of a random person in the city being white = 0.85 (from information a)
3. P(Correct ID | Black) = probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person = 0.80 (from information b)
4. P(Incorrect ID | Black) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person = 1 - P(Correct ID | Black) = 0.20 (from information b)
5. P(Correct ID | White) = probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person = 0.80 (from information b, assuming the witness's error rate is the same for both races)
6. P(Incorrect ID | White) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person = 1 - P(Correct ID | White) = 0.20 (from information b)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Black | Witness ID) = [P(Witness ID | Black) \* P(Black)] / [P(Witness ID | Black) \* P(Black) + P(Witness ID | White) \* P(White)]

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can substitute P(Witness ID | Black) with P(Correct ID | Black) and P(Witness ID | White) with P(Incorrect ID | White):

P(Black | Witness ID) = [P(Correct ID | Black) \* P(Black)] / [P(Correct ID | Black) \* P(Black) + P(Incorrect ID | White) \* P(White)]

Substituting the values we defined earlier:

P(Black | Witness ID) = [(0.80 \* 0.15)] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(Black | Witness ID) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(Black | Witness ID) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Black | Witness ID) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
