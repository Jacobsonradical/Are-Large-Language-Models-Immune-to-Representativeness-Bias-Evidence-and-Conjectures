To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population data.
- P(W) as the prior probability of a random person being white, which is 0.85 (85%).
- P(C|B) as the conditional probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(C|W) as the conditional probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(B|C), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Now, let's substitute the given values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(B|C) â‰ˆ 0.395

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.395.
