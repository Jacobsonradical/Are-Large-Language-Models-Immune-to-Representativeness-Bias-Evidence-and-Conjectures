To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (which we want to find)
- P(B) is the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (from information a)
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (from information b)
- P(not B) is the prior probability of a random person not being black, which is 0.85 (from information a)
- P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (from information b)

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 41%.
