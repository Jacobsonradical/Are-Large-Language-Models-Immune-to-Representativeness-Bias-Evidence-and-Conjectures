To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 or 15% based on the population demographics.
P(W) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 or 85%.
P(C|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 or 80%.
P(C|W) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 or 20%.

We want to find P(B|C), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|C) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(B|C) â‰ˆ 0.395 or 39.5%

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 39.5%.

The answer is: {probability: 0.395}
