To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B). We can express this as P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B), where:

* P(B|A) is the probability of observing B given A, i.e., the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
* P(A) is the prior probability of A, i.e., the probability that the attacker is black before we consider any new evidence.
* P(B) is the prior probability of B, i.e., the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, regardless of their actual race.

We are given the following information:

* P(B|A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time.
* P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of the population in the city is black.
* P(¬A) = 0.85, since 85% of the population in the city is white.

We also need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

We can now calculate P(B) as follows:

* P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
* P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12
* P(B and ¬A) = P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17
* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

* P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
