To solve this problem, you can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black (B) given the witness's testimony (A).
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black.
- P(not B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is not black.
- P(A|not B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

From the information given, we know:

- P(A|B) = 0.8
- P(B) = 0.15
- P(not B) = 0.85
- P(A|not B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4211

{probability: 0.4211}
