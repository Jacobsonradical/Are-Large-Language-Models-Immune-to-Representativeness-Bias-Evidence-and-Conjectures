To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 according to information (a).
P(~B) as the prior probability of a random person being not black (white), which is 0.85.
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are indeed black. This is also known as the true positive rate, which is 0.8 according to information (b).
P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black (white). This is the false positive rate, which is 0.2.
P(B|W) as the probability we want to find, i.e., the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.395.

{probability: 0.395}
