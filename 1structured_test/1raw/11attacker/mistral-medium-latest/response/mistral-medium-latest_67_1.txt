To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is black

We want to calculate the probability P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given the following information:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person in the city being black is 15%)
P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person in the city not being black, i.e., being white, is 85%)

We also need to find P(W|~H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases:

P(W|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)

After calculating P(W), we can now find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)

After substituting the values and calculating, we get:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.357.

{probability: 0.357}
