To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here, the event is "the attacker is black," and the condition is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

First, let's define our terms:

P(B) is the probability of the attacker being black without any additional information. From the information given, this is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black).

P(~B) is the probability of the attacker not being black without any additional information. This is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white).

P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. From the information given, this is 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time).

P(W|~B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in our values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3846

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.3846 or 38.46%.

{probability: 0.3846}
