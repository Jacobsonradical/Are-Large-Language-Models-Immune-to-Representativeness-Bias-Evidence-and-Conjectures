To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|W) \* P(W)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified them as black (A).
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(B) is the prior probability of a person being black in the city, which is 0.15.
- P(A|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.
- P(W) is the prior probability of a person being white in the city, which is 0.85.

Given the information in the question:
- P(A|B) = 0.8
- P(A|W) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately:
