To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to information "b".
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 according to information "a".
P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 according to information "a".

First, we need to find P(not B), which is the prior probability of a random person being white:
P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness testimony (P(B|W)):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3929

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.3929.
