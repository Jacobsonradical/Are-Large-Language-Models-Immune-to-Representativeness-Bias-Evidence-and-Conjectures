To find the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. Here, we want to know the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Let's denote:
P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to information (a).
P(WB|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8 according to information (b).
P(WB|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 according to information (b).

We want to find P(B|WB), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|WB) = [P(WB|B) \* P(B)] / [P(WB|B) \* P(B) + P(WB|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|WB) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(B|WB) â‰ˆ 0.41

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.
