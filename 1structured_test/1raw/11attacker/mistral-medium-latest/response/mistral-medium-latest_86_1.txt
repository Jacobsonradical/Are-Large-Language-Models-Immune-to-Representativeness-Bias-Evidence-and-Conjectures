{probability: 0.47}

This is a Bayesian inference problem. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black (H) given the witness's testimony (E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:
P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.47

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.47.
