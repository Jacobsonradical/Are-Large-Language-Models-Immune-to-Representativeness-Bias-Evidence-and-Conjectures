To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula used to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (H) given the witness testimony (E).

First, let's define some probabilities:
P(H) = Prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~H) = Prior probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85 (from information b)
P(E|H) = Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black = 0.8 (from information a)
P(E|~H) = Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black = 0.2 (from information a)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.3889.

{probability: 0.3889}
