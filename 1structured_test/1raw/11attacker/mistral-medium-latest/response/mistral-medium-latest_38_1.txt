To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified them as black (evidence E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|not B) \* P(not B)]

We are given:

P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a random person being black in the city)
P(not B) = 0.85 (probability of a random person being white in the city)
P(E|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(E|not B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can calculate P(B|E):

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.397

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.397.

{probability: 0.397}
