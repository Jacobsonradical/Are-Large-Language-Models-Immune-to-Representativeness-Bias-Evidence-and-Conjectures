To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:

* P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the information given.
* P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 based on the information given.
* P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 based on the information given.
* P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 based on the information given.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4063

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4063.
