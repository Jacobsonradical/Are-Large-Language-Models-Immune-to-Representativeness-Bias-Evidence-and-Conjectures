{probability: 0.51, explanation: "Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. First, we need to find the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the population distribution. Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if they are indeed black, which is 80% or 0.8. We also need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if they are not black, which is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time). Then, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability: P(attacker is black | witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is not black) * P(attacker is not black)]. Plugging in the values, we get: P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.51."}
