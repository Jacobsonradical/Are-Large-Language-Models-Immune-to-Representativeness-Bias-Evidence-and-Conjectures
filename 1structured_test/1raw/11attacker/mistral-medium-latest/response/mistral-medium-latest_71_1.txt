To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypotheses are "the attacker is black" (H) and "the attacker is white" (~H), and the evidence is "the witness identified the attacker as black" (E).

Let's denote the prior probabilities of H and ~H as P(H) and P(~H), respectively. From the given information, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Let's denote the conditional probability of the evidence given each hypothesis as P(E|H) and P(E|~H), respectively. From the given information, we know that:

P(E|H) = 1.0 (if the attacker is black, the witness will always identify them as black)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, so they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.41 or 41%

However, since the witness's identification is not perfect and there is a possibility of error, we should also consider the possibility that the attacker is actually white but was misidentified as black by the witness.

To estimate the probability of this scenario, we can use the same formula for P(~H|E):

P(~H|E) = [P(E|~H) \* P(~H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(~H|E) = (0.2 \* 0.85) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(~H|E) ≈ 0.59 or 59%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%, while the probability that the attacker is actually white but was misidentified as black is approximately 0.59 or 59%.
