To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is black

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / [P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H)]

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|not H) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

{probability: 0.409}
