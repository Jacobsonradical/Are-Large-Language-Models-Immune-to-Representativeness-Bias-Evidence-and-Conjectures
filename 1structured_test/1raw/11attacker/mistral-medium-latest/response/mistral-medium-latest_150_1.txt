To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B), given the information provided.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(A) = 0.15 (the population of black people in the city)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the population of white people in the city)

We still need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and these errors are distributed evenly between misidentifying black and white people:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
     = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85]

{probability: 0.4313725490196079, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4314.
