To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, the prior probability is the racial makeup of the city (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B) and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black as P(W|B) (where "W" stands for "witness"). According to the information given:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

Now, we need to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

We already know P(W|B) and P(B). To find P(W), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, we can calculate it as the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: the witness identifying a black person as black and the witness identifying a white person as black:

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)

We know P(W|B) and P(B), but we still need P(W|not B) and P(not B). Since P(B) = 0.15, it follows that P(not B) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white). We're told that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is:

P(W|not B) = 0.2 (20% error rate)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)
      = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)
        = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
        â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
