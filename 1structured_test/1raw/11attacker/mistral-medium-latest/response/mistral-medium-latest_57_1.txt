To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black.
E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the given information:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We also need to find P(E|not H), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3889 or 38.89%.
