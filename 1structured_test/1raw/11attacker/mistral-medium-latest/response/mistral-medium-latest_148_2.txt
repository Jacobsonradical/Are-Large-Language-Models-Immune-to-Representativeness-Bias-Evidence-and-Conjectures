To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is black or white, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B) and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W). We are given the following information:

1. P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85 (from the population data)
2. P(E|B) = 1.0 and P(E|W) = 0.2 (from the witness's accuracy data, where E is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|E) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.409

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the population data, is approximately 0.409.
