To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population demographics.
- P(W) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 (85%).
- P(E|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(E|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Now we can plug in the values:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.397

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.397.
