This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that helps us update the probabilities of hypotheses when we receive new evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as I. We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

where P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(¬B) is the probability of the attacker not being black, P(I|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black, and P(I|¬B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black.

From the information given, we have:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black)
P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(I|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies non-black people as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|I) ≈ 0.409 or 40.9%

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify a person's race is not affected by the race of the person they are identifying. If the witness is more likely to misidentify a non-black person as black than to misidentify a black person as non-black, then the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony would be lower than this estimate.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.409 or 40.9%. However, this estimate should be interpreted with caution, as it is based on assumptions that may not be true in this particular case.
