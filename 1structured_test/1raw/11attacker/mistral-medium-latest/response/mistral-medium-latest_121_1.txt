To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony (P(Black|Testimony)).

First, we need to find the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is black in two scenarios: when the attacker is truly black (P(Testimony|Black)), and when the attacker is white (P(Testimony|White)). According to the information provided, these probabilities are:

P(Testimony|Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(Testimony|White) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(Black|Testimony) = [P(Testimony|Black) \* P(Black)] / [P(Testimony|Black) \* P(Black) + P(Testimony|White) \* P(White)]

We are given that the proportion of black people in the city is 15% (P(Black) = 0.15) and white people is 85% (P(White) = 0.85). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Black|Testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(Black|Testimony) â‰ˆ 0.409

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.409.
