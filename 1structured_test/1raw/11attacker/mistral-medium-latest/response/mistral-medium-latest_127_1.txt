To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the racial distribution in the city.
P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(I|B) as the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(I|W) as the probability of identifying the attacker as black given that they are white, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(B|I), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.395.
