This is a classic example of Bayesian inference. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the city's demographics.
* P(~B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85.
* P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy.
* P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.

We want to calculate the posterior probability P(B|W) that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:

probability: 0.36842105263157894

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.368.
