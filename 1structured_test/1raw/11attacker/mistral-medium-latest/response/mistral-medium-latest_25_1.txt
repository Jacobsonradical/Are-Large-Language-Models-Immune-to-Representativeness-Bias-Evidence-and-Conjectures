To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in the field of statistics and probability.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 or 15% based on the population demographics in the city.
* P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 or 85%.
* P(E|B) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 or 80%.
* P(E|W) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white, which is 0.2 or 20%.

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138 or 41.38%

However, we need to provide the estimate in the requested format, so:

{probability: 0.4138}
