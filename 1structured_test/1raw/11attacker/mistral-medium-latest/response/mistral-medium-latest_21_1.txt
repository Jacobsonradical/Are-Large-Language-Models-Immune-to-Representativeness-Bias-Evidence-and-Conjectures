To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 or 41.38%

However, since the witness's accuracy is less than perfect, we cannot say for certain that the attacker is black. Our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony is approximately 41.38%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
