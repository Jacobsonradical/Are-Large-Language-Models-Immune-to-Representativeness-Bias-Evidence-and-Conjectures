To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

In this case:

Event B: The attacker is black
Event A: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the problem statement, we have:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

The witness's accuracy rates are given as:

P(A|B) = 0.80 (Witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(A|not B) = 0.20 (Witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

However, since we want the probability in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, the answer is:

{probability: 0.409}
