To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) = probability that the attacker is black, which is our prior probability (based on population data)
P(W|B) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given they are black), which is the witness's accuracy when identifying black people
P(W|~B) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given they are white), which is the witness's false positive rate

Given the information provided:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(W|~B) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

First, calculate P(~B), the probability that the attacker is white:
P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3974

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population data, is approximately 0.3974.
