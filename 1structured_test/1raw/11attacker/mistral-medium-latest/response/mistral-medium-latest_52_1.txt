To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) is the probability that the attacker is black, which we're trying to find.
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. The witness gets this right 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.
- P(W|¬B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. The witness gets this wrong 20% of the time, so P(W|¬B) = 0.2.
- P(B) is also the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is given as 15%, so P(B) = 0.15.
- P(¬B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is given as 85%, so P(¬B) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.41 or 41%

But since the question asks for the probability in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, the answer is:

{probability: 0.41}
