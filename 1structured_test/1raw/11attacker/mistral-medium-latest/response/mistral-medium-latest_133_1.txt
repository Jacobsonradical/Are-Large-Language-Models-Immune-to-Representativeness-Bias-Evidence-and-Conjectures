{probability: 0.51}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the population demographics (information "a"): P(Black) = 0.15 and P(White) = 0.85.
2. Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black [True Positive Rate (TPR)]: P(Identified as Black | Black) = 0.8.
3. Similarly, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white [False Positive Rate (FPR)]: P(Identified as Black | White) = 0.2.
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that they were identified as black by the witness: P(Black | Identified as Black) = [P(Identified as Black | Black) \* P(Black)] / [P(Identified as Black | Black) \* P(Black) + P(Identified as Black | White) \* P(White)].
5. Plugging in the values from steps 1-3, we get: P(Black | Identified as Black) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.51.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the provided information is approximately 0.51.
