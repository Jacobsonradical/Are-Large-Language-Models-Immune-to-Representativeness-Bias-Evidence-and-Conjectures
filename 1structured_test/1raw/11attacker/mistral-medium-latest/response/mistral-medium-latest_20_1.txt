To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability.

Let's denote:

B: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find the probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / P(W)

We are given P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), and P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black). We are also given that P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

To find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white.

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)

We are given that P(W|B) = 0.8, and we know P(B) = 0.15. We are missing P(W|~B), which is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W|~B) = 0.2 (20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / P(W)
P(B|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
