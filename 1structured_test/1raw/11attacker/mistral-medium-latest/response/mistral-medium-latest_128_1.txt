To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|W) \* P(W)]

Where:
P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified them as black (A).
P(B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15.
P(A|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8.
P(W) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is white, which is 0.85.
P(A|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.4138.
