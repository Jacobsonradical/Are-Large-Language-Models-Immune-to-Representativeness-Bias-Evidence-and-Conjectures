{probability: 0.47}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
2. Let P(B) be the prior probability that the attacker is black and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black. Similarly, let P(~B) be the prior probability that the attacker is not black and P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are not black.
3. We are given P(B) = 0.15, P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|~B) = 0.2, and P(~B) = 0.85.
4. Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)].
5. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.47.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.47.
