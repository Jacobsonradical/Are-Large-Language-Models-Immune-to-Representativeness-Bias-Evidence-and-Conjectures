To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|W) \* P(W)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black (B) given the witness's testimony (A).
- P(A|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black.
- P(B) is the prior probability of a random person being black (from the population statistics).
- P(A|W) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.
- P(W) is the prior probability of a random person being white.

Given the information provided:
- P(A|B) = 0.8
- P(B) = 0.15
- P(A|W) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(W) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.421

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.421.

{probability: 0.421}
