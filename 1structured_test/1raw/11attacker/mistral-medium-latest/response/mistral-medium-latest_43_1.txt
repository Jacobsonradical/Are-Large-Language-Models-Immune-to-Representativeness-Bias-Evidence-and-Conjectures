{probability: 0.51}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We need to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which means the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
2. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]
3. From the given information, P(B) = 0.15 (15% chance of being black in the population) and P(not B) = 0.85 (85% chance of being white in the population).
4. The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, so P(W|not B) = 0.2.
5. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem: P(B|W) = [(0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))] â‰ˆ 0.51

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.51.
