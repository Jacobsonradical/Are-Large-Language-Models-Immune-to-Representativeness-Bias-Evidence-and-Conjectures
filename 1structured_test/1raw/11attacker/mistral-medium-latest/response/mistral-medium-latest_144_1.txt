We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:

B is the event that the attacker is black
W is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|not B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.4138}
