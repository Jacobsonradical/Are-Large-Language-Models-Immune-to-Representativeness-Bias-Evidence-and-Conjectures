To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (H) given that the witness identified them as black (D).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) \* P(H)] / [P(D|H) \* P(H) + P(D|not H) \* P(not H)]

Here's how we can apply it to this problem:

1. P(D|H): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. According to the information provided, this probability is 0.8 (80%).

2. P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is black. Given that 15% of the population is black, this probability is 0.15.

3. P(D|not H): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is 0.2.

4. P(not H): The prior probability that the attacker is not black. Given that 85% of the population is white, this probability is 0.85.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(H|D) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
