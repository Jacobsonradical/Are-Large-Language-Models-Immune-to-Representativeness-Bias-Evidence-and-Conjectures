To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black." We want to find P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

From the information given, we can estimate the following probabilities:

* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. This is given by the population statistics as 0.15.
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 0.8.
* P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This is given as 0.2.
* P(¬A) is the prior probability that the attacker is white. This is given by the population statistics as 0.85.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we have estimated:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the value:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony and population statistics, is approximately 0.41.
