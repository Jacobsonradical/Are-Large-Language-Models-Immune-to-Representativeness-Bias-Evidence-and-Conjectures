To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is "the attacker is black," and the new evidence is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the information about the city population.

P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85.

P(E|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate.

P(E|~B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.40625

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.406 or 40.6%.

{probability: 0.406}
