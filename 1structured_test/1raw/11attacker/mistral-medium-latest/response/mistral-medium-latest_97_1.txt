To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula used to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence.

Let:

* H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
* P(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis, i.e. the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence
* P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, i.e. the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
* P(E|~H): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, i.e. the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black
* P(~H): the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, i.e. the probability that the attacker is white

From the information given, we have:

* P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
* P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis, i.e. the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.22
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.5455

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.5455.
