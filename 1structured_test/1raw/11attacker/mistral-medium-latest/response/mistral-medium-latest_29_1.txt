To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|A) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.
P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 from the information provided.
P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A|not B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 20% or 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
