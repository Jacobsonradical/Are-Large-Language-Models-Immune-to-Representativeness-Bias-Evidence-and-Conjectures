To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|W) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.
P(W|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black.
P(B) is the prior probability of a random person being black in the city.
P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.
P(not B) is the prior probability of a random person being white in the city.

Using the information provided, we have:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.42

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.42.
