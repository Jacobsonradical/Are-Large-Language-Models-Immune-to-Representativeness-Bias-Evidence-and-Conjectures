To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (H), given that the witness identified the attacker as black (D).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) \* P(H)] / [P(D|H) \* P(H) + P(D|not H) \* P(not H)]

We are given:

* P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
* P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

We also need to find P(D|not H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. We are given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so:

* P(D|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|D) â‰ˆ 0.387

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.387.
