To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the given information.
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(W|¬B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Now we can plug in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(B|W) ≈ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, we are asked to provide a probability between 0 and 1, so:

{probability: 0.357}
