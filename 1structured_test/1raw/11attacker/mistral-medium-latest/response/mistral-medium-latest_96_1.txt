To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
P(B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 according to a.
P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 according to b.
P(not B) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 0.85 according to a.
P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 according to b.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.4138}
