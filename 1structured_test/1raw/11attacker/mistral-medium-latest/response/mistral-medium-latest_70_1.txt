To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a method of calculating conditional probabilities, which can help us determine the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black.

Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (15%) in this case.
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).
P(not B) as the prior probability of a random person being white, which is 0.85 (85%).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.357 or 35.7%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.357.
