To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the prior knowledge is the witness's accuracy and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the witness identifying someone as black as P(W|B) when they are black, and P(W|not B) when they are not black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

From the information given, we know that:

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.409

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.409.
