To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find the probabilities for each term in the equation:

1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% or 0.15 (from information a).

2. P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that they are black, is 80% or 0.8 (from information b).

3. P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated by law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A), where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). Since P(¬A) = 0.85, and the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2 (from information b), we have P(B|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.264.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.264 ≈ 0.4545

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4545.
