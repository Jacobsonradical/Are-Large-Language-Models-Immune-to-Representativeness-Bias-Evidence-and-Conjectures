To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability of a random person in the city being black, which is 0.15.
* P(W|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8.
* P(W|~B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, due to rounding errors, the exact value may be slightly different when calculated with higher precision.
