To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information given.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8 based on the information given.
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 20% or 0.2 based on the information given.
- P(not B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the information given.

Then, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.12 / [(0.12 + 0.17)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
