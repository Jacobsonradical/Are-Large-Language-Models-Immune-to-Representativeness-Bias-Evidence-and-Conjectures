To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [ P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) ]

From the information given, we know that:

* P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.386

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.386.
