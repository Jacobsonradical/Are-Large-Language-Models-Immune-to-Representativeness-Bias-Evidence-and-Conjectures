To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (from the population data).
- P(W|B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if they are indeed black.
- P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black.
- P(W|not B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if they are not black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.414

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414.
