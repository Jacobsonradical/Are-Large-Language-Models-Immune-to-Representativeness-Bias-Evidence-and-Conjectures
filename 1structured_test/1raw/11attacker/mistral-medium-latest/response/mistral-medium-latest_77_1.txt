To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
P(B) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the city's demographics.
P(W|B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy.
P(W|¬B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's inaccuracy.
P(¬B) be the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 based on the city's demographics.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.363

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics is approximately 0.363 or 36.3%.
