To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case:

Event A: The attacker is black.
Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.409

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.409.
