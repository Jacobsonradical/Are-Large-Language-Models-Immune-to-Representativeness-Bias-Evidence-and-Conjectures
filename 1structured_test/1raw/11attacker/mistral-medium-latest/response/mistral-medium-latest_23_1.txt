To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that calculates the probability of an event occurring, given prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B), given that the witness identified the attacker as black (evidence E).

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|not B) \* P(not B)]

First, let's identify the probabilities:

1. P(B): The prior probability that the attacker is black. From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population in the city is black, so P(B) = 0.15.
2. P(not B): The prior probability that the attacker is not black. Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85.
3. P(E|B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|B) = 0.8.
4. P(E|not B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. The witness errs in identifying a non-black person as black 20% of the time, so P(E|not B) = 0.2.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.409

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.409.
