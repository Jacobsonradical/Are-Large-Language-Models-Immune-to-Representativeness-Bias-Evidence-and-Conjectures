To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(Black|Witness)).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case:

- Event A is "the attacker is black"
- Event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black"

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(Black|Witness) = [P(Witness|Black) \* P(Black)] / P(Witness)

From the given information:

- P(Black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(Witness|Black) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(Not Black) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(Witness|Not Black) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We still need to calculate P(Witness). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness and Black) + P(Witness and Not Black)
P(Witness) = P(Witness|Black) \* P(Black) + P(Witness|Not Black) \* P(Not Black)

Now we can plug in the values:

P(Witness) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(Witness) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(Witness) = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(Black|Witness) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(Black|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
