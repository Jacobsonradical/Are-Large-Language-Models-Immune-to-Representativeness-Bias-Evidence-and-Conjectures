To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the events we are interested in:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find the probability of event A given event B occurred, P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Given the information, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(A): The probability that the attacker is black is 15% (from the first piece of information).
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black is 80% (from the second piece of information).
3. P(B): To find this probability, we need to consider two cases: (a) the attacker is black, and the witness identifies them correctly, and (b) the attacker is white, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as black. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

Now let's calculate the required probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15
2. P(B|A) = 0.8

To find P(B and A), we multiply the probabilities of A and B given A:
P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Since there are only two possibilities for the attacker's race, the probability of not A (the attacker being white) is:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is given as 20% (from the second piece of information), so:
P(B|not A) = 0.2

To find P(B and not A), we multiply the probabilities of not A and B given not A:
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can find P(B) by adding the two cases:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the required probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
