To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B).

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(¬A) based on the racial distribution in the city:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Next, let's find the likelihoods P(B|A) and P(B|¬A) based on the witness's accuracy:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

Numerator = 0.12
Denominator = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
