To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(Attacker is Black | Witness said Black)).

First, let's define some probabilities:

P(B) = Probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~B) = Probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85 (from information b)
P(W|B) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W|~B) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black = 0.2 (from information a)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) \* P(B)) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.395.
