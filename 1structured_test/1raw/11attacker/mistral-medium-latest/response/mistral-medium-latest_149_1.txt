To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, our event is the attacker being black (H), and our prior knowledge is the witness's testimony (D).

First, let's define our terms:

- P(H): The probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population data (a).
- P(~H): The probability that the attacker is not black (white), which is 0.85 based on the population data (a).
- P(D|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate (b).
- P(D|~H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (white). This is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate (b).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) \* P(H)] / [P(D|H) \* P(H) + P(D|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in our values:

P(H|D) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(H|D) â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.395.
