To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the prior probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probabilities are the racial distribution in the city (85% white and 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is our prior probability (0.15).
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (0.8).
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (0.2).
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, which is what we want to find.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, since you asked for the probability as a number between 0 and 1:

{probability: 0.357}
