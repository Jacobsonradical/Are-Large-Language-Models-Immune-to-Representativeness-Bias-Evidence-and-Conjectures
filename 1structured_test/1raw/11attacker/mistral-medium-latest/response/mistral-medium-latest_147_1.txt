To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(not H) = probability that the attacker is white = 0.85 (85% of the population)
P(W|H) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person = 0.80
P(W|not H) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black = 0.20

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4091 or 40.91%

However, since we want to provide a number between 0 and 1, we'll express this as a decimal:

{probability: 0.4091}
