To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is black
W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find the probability P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

We have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person with 80% probability)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with 20% probability)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(W) ≈ 0.23

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(H|W) ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.522.
