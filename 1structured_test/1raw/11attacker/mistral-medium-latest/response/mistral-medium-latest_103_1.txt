To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population demographics.
- P(W|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate.
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability we want to find, i.e., the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

We also need P(W|not B), which is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). This can be calculated as 1 - the witness's accuracy rate for identifying white people, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) \* P(B)) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3974

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3974 or 39.74%.
