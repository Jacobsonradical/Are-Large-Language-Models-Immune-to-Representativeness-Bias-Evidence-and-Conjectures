To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony
P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black
P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black

From the information given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is also 20%)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4138.
