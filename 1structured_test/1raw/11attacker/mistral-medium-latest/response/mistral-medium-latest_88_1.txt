To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony (this is what we want to find).
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(A|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.
- P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is white.

From the information provided, we know that:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(A|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|A) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.409

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.409.
