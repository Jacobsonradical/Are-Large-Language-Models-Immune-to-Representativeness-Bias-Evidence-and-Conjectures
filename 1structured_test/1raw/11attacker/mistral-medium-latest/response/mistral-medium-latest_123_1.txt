To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

From the information provided:

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

We still need to find P(W|not B) and P(not B) to calculate P(W):

P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(W) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) \* P(B)) / P(W)
P(B|W) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(B|W) ≈ 0.5217

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.5217.
