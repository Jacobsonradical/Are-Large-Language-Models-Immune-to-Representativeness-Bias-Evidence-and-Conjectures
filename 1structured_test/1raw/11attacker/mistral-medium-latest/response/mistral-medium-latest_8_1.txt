To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is black
W: The witness identifies the attacker as black
P(H): Probability that the attacker is black
P(W|H): Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
P(W|¬H): Probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black

We are given that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|H) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Now, let's find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black (P(H|W)):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.395

{probability: 0.395}
