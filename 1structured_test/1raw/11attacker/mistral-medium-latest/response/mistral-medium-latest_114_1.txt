This is a classic example of Bayesian inference. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (from information a)
P(~B) as the prior probability of a random person being not black (white), which is 0.85

P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (from information b)
P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Now, calculate the expression above:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3947 or 39.47%

The probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3947.
