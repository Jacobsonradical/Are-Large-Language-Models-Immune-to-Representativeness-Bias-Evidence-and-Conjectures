To find the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate the posterior probability P(B|A), or the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified them as black (A).

First, let's define the probabilities:
P(B) = Probability that the attacker is black
P(~B) = Probability that the attacker is not black (white)
P(A|B) = Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
P(A|~B) = Probability that the witness identifies a white person as black

From the information provided:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(A|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(A|~B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|~B) \* P(~B)]

P(B|A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85))
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.3947

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3947.
