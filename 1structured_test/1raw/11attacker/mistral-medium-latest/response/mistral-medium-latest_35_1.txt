To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find the probability P(A|B). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Using the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

We still need to determine P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not black. Since 85% of the population is white, P(¬A) = 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.20. Plugging these values into the equation:

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)

Now we have all the necessary probabilities to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / P(B)

After calculating P(B) and substituting the values:

{probability: 0.4285714285714286, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
