To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(¬B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black
- P(A|¬B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black

From the given information:
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness identifies black people correctly 80% of the time)
- P(A|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness identifies white people as black 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) ≈ 0.42

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.42.
