To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black". We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
