To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the information given.
P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 based on the information given.
P(I|B) as the conditional probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the information given.
P(I|W) as the conditional probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 based on the information given.

We want to find P(B|I), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

However, since we are asked to provide an estimate between 0 and 1, we can express this as a decimal:

{probability: 0.409}
