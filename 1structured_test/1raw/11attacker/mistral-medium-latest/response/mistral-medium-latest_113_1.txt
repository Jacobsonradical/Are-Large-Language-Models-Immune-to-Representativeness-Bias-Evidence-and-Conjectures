To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a randomly chosen person being black, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(W) as the prior probability of a randomly chosen person being white, which is 0.85 (from information a).
P(I|B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(I|W) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are white, which is 0.2 (from information b).

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4091

{probability: 0.4091}
