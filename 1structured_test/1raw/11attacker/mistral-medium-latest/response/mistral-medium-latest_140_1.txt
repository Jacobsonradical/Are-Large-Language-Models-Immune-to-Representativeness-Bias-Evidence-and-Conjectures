To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Next, let's find the likelihoods:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.41.
