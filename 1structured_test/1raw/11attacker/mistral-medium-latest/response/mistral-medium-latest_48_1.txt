To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population percentages.
* P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 based on the population percentages.
* P(I|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy.
* P(I|W) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 based on the witness's inaccuracy.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black can be calculated as follows:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.41}
