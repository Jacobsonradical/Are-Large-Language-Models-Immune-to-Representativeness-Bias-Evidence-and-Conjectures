To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (from information b)
* P(W) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 (from information b)
* P(I|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (from information a)
* P(I|W) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 (from information a)

We want to find P(B|I), which is the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.396

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.396.
