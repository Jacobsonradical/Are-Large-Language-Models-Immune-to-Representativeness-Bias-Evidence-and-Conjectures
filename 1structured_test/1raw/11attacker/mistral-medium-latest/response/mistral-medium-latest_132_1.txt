To find the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence and is defined as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A represents the attacker being black, and event B represents the witness identifying the attacker as black. We want to find the probability P(A|B) that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a random person being black in the city, based on the population distribution)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

First, let's find P(¬A), which is the probability of a random person being white in the city:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies a random person as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.5217

{probability: 0.5217}
