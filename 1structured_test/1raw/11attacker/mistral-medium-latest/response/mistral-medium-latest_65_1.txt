To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15% or 0.15).
P(A|B) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black if they are indeed black (80% or 0.8).
P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black (85% or 0.85).
P(A|not B) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black if they are not black (20% or 0.2).

Now let's calculate the probability:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.42

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.42.

{probability: 0.42}
