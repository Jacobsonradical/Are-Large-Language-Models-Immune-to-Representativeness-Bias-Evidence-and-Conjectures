{probability: 0.51}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony.
2. Let P(B) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the population information.
3. Let P(W|B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy.
4. Let P(W|not B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.
5. Let P(not B) be the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 based on the population information.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]
7. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.51
