To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Let's denote the events as follows:
   - B: The attacker is black
   - W: The witness identifies the attacker as black
   - ~W: The witness does not identify the attacker as black (this event is not used in our problem, but it helps to have a complete notation)
2. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
3. Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W).
4. We are given the following probabilities:
   - P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
   - P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
   - P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
   - Since P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their race, we can find it using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)
5. We need to find P(W|~B), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases and correctly identifies white people 80% of the time, we can calculate P(W|~B) as follows: P(W|~B) = 1 - P(correctly identifying a white person) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
6. Now we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
7. Finally, we can find P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem: P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

Estimate: {probability: 0.4138}
