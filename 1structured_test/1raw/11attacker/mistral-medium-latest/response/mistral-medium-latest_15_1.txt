This problem involves Bayes' theorem, which is used to find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E). Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black (H), and the evidence is the witness testimony (E). We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

First, let's calculate the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem:

1. P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is equal to the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
2. P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is black. Given that 15% of the population is black, this probability is 0.15.
3. P(E): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This is a bit more complex to calculate, as it involves the probability of both the witness identifying a black attacker as black and the witness identifying a white attacker as black by mistake: P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H). Here, P(not H) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is their error rate, which is 0.2. So, P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
