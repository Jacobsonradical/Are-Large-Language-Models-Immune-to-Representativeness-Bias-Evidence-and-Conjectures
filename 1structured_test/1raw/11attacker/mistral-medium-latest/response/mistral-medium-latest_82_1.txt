To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
E: The evidence provided by the witness

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of a random person being black in the city is 15%)

We also need to find P(E|¬H) and P(¬H), which are the probabilities of the witness identifying a white person as black, and the prior probability of a random person being white, respectively. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases:

P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (the prior probability of a random person being white in the city is 85%)

Now we need to find P(E), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black. Since the witness can either correctly identify a black person as black or incorrectly identify a white person as black, we can express P(E) as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.255

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E) ≈ [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.467.
