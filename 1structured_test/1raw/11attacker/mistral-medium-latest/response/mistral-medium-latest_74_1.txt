To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:

- P(B|A) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.
- P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black.
- P(A|not B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.

From the information given, we can assign the following values:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(A|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies black individuals 80% of the time)
- P(A|not B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies white individuals as black 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.3974

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3974.
