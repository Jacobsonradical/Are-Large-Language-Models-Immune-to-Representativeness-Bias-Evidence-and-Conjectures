To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we will use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|W) \* P(W)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony
- P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black, given that they are black (80% or 0.8)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% or 0.15)
- P(A|W) is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black, given that they are white (20% or 0.2)
- P(W) is the prior probability of the attacker being white (85% or 0.85)

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.384

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.384.
