To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
P(B|A) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (which we want to find).
P(A|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.
P(B) is the prior probability of a random person being black in the city, which is 0.15.
P(A|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and 85% of the population is white).
P(not B) is the prior probability of a random person not being black in the city, which is 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.3947

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.3947.
