To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on information 'a'.

P(W) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 based on information 'a'.

P(E|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 based on information 'b'.

P(E|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are white, which is 0.2 based on information 'b'.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Now, we can substitute the values:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

So, P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.3947 or 39.47%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3947.
