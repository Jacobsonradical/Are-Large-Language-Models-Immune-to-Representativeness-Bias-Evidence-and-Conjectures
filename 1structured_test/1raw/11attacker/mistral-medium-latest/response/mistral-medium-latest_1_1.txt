To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(Attacker is Black | Witness said Black)).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case:

Event A: The attacker is black.
Event B: The witness says the attacker is black.

We are looking for P(A|B).

We know:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B). We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
     = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.4138.
