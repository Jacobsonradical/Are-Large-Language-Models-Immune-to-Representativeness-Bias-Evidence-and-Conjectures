To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on information b.
* P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85%).
* P(W|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on information a.
* P(W|~B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 based on information a.

Then, according to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3846

Therefore, {probability: 0.3846}
