To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

In this equation:

- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if they are indeed black, which is 0.8 (80% of the time).
- P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black if they are not black, which is 0.2 (20% of the time).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.397

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.397 or 39.7%.
