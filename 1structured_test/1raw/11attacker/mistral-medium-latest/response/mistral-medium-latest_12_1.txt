This is a classic example of Bayesian inference. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. First, we know the prior probabilities based on the racial distribution in the city: P(Black) = 0.15 and P(White) = 0.85.
2. Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's identification, given the true race of the attacker. From the information provided, we have:
   - P(Identified as Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
   - P(Identified as Black | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
3. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:
   - P(Black | Identified as Black) = [P(Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Identified as Black | White) * P(White)]
   - P(Black | Identified as Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
