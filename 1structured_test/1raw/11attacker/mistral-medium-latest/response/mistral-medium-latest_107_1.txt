To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that event A has occurred
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given the following information:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.3889.
