To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of a random person being black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city).
- P(W) as the prior probability of a random person being white, which is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city).
- P(C|B) as the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (according to the witness's accuracy rate).
- P(C|W) as the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (according to the witness's error rate).

We want to find P(B|C), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the numerator:

0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Calculate the denominator:

(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, find P(B|C):

P(B|C) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
