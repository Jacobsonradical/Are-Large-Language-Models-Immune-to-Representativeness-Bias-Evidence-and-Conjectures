To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the population demographics.
P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85.
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.
P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3974

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3974.
