To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(B) as the prior probability of a person being black in the city, which is 0.15 according to information (a).
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are black. This is the witness's true positive rate, which is 0.8 according to information (b).
P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are not black (i.e., they are white). This is the witness's false positive rate, which is 0.2 according to information (b).

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) \* P(B)) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.409.
