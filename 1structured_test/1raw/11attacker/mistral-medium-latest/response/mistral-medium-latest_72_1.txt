To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is black, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

1. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black is 15%, as stated in the information (a).
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black, is 80%, as stated in the information (b).
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This is calculated as the sum of two probabilities: (a) the probability that the attacker is black and the witness identifies them correctly, and (b) the probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes an error.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Given that the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
