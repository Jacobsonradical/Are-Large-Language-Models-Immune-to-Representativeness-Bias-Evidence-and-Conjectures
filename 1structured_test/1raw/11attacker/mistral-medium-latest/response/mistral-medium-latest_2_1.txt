To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps find the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (H) given that the witness identified them as black (D).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H|D) = [P(D|H) \* P(H)] / [P(D|H) \* P(H) + P(D|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Where:
P(H|D) is the posterior probability of H given D
P(D|H) is the likelihood of observing D given H
P(H) is the prior probability of H
P(¬H) is the prior probability of not H
P(D|¬H) is the likelihood of observing D given not H

We are given the following information:
P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness identifies a black person correctly 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We still need to find P(D|¬H), which is the likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can say:
P(D|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness misidentifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|D) ≈ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3889 or 38.89%.
