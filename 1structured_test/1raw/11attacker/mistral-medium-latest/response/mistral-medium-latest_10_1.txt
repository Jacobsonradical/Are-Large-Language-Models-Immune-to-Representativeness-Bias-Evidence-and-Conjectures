To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is "the attacker is black," and the new evidence is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:

* P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, i.e., before the witness testimony.
* P(W|B) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
* P(W|¬B) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black.
* P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

From the information given, we know that:

* P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
* P(¬B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
* P(W|B) = 0.80 (since the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
* P(W|¬B) = 0.20 (since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was not black)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.409

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.409 or 40.9%.
