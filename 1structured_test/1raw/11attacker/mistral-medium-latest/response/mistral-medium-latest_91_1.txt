To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event A) given that the witness identified them as black (evidence B).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black
- P(¬A) is the probability of the attacker not being black
- P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 \* P(B|A) (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and the population is evenly split between black and white, the probability of a false positive is half the error rate times the probability of the attacker being black)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.8 \* 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.016)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.882

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.882.
