To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)).

First, let's define the following probabilities:

P(B): Probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information a)
P(~B): Probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85 (from information a)
P(W|B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W|~B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are not black = 0.2 (from information b)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

However, since the question asks for an estimate in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, the final answer would be:

{probability: 0.409}
