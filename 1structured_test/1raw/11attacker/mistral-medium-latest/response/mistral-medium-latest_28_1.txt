To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (from information a).
P(C|B) as the conditional probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(C|W) as the conditional probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (from information b).

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (denoted as P(B|C)) can be calculated as follows:

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.395.
