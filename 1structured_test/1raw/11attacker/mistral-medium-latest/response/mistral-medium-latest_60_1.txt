To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, we have:

Event A: The attacker is black.
Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population percentages)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We also need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness errs in identifying a person's race)

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population percentages, is approximately 0.41.
