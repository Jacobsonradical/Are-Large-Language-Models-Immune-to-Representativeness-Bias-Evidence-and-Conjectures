To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let's denote:
A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We're interested in finding P(A|B). We're given the following probabilities:

1. P(A): The probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.80 (80%).
3. P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.20 (20%).

First, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) is the probability that a random person in the city is white, P(¬A) = 0.85 (85%). Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23 (23%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.5217

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the provided information, is approximately 0.5217.
