To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (which we want to find)
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population)
- P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and the false positive rate for a black identification is half of that, i.e., 0.2)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.409
