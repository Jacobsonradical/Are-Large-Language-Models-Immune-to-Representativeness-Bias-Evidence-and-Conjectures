To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)). Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W).

Let's break down each term:

1. P(B): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the information provided.
2. P(W|B): This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black. Based on the witness's accuracy rate, this is 80% or 0.8.
3. P(W): This is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, whether they are black or not. To find this, we need to consider both possibilities: the witness identifying a black attacker as black (P(W|B) \* P(B)) and the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black (P(W|not B) \* P(not B)). We know that P(W|not B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time), and P(not B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white). So, P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85).

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
