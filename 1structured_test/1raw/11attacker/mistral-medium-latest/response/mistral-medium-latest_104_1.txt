We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where:
A is the event that the attacker is black,
B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black,
¬A is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white),
P(A) is the prior probability of A, and
P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing B given A.

We are given the following information:

* P(A) = 0.15 (from fact b)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A))
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (from fact a)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from fact a)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.397

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.397 or 39.7%.
