To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a random person in the city being black, which is 0.15 (from information "a").
P(~B) as the prior probability of a random person in the city being not black (white), which is 0.85.
P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black, which is 0.8 (from information "b").
P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black (white), which is 0.2.
P(B|W) as the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black, which is what we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3947

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony is approximately 0.3947.
