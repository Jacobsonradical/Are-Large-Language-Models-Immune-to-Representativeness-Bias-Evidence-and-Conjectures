To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

First, let's define some probabilities:

* P(B): The prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population statistics (0.15)
* P(~B): The prior probability that the attacker is not black (0.85)
* P(W|B): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (0.8)
* P(W|~B): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (0.2)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.382

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.382.
