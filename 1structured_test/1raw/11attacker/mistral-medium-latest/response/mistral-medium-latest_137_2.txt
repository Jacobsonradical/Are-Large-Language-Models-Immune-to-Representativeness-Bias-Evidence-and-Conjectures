To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified them as black (I). Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as follows:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) \* P(B) / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Where:

* P(B|I) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
* P(I|B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are black.
* P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
* P(I|W) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are white.
* P(W) is the prior probability that the attacker is white.

From the information provided, we know that:

* P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
* P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
* P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)
* P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.394

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.394.
