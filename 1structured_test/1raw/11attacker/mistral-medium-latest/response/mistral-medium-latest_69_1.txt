To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a person being black, which is 0.15 (15%) from information b.
P(W) as the prior probability of a person being white, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(C|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 from information a.
P(C|W) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 from information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony (P(B|C)):

P(B|C) = [P(C|B) \* P(B)] / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4375

{probability: 0.4375}
