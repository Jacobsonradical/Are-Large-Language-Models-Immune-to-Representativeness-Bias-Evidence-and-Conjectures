To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is black (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event B). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Here, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which can be obtained from the population data (15% or 0.15). P(¬A), the probability of the attacker not being black, is 1 - P(A) or 0.85.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given that they are black. This is 80% or 0.8.

P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, given that they are not black. This is 20% or 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

After calculating the expression:

probability: 0.4285714285714286 (rounded to 0.429)

Keep in mind that this result is an estimate based on the given information and might not reflect the true probability in real life. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the accuracy of the witness's ability to identify race and the representativeness of the population data.
