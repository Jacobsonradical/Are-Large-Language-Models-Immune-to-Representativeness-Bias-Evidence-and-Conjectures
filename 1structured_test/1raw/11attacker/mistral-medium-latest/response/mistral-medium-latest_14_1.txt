To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black (H), and the evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as black (E).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:

* P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which is what we want to find.
* P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is black before we consider the evidence.
* P(not H) is the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is not black before we consider the evidence.
* P(E|not H) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

From the information given, we know that:

* P(E|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
* P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is:

* P(E|not H) = 0.20 \* (1 - P(E|H)) = 0.20 \* (1 - 0.80) = 0.04

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.04 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.278

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.278 or 27.8%.
