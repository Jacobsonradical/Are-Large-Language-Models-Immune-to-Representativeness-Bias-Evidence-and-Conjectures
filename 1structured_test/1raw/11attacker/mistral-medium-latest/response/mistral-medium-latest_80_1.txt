To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event A) given that the witness identified them as black (event B).

First, let's define our probabilities:

P(A) = probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~A) = probability that the attacker is not black = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from information b)
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black = 0.8 (from information a)
P(B|~A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are not black = 0.2 (from information a)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = [0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)]
P(A|B) = [0.12 / 0.29]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.
