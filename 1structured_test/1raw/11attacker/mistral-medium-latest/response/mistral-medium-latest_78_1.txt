To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to information b.
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8 according to information a.
P(W|¬B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 according to information a.
P(¬B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 0.85 (85%).

Our goal is to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3974 or 39.74%

{probability: 0.3974}
