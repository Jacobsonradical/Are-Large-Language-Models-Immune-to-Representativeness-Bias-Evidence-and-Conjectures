To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Let's plug in the given values:

P(W|B) = probability of witness identifying someone as black given that they are black = 0.8
P(B) = prior probability of a random person being black in the city = 0.15
P(not B) = prior probability of a random person not being black in the city = 0.85

We still need to find P(W|not B), which is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black. We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so:

P(W|not B) = probability of witness identifying someone as black given that they are white = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%

Final answer: {probability: 0.41}
