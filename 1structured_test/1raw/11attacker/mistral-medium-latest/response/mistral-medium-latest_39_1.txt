To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)).

First, let's define the probabilities:
P(B): The prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(W|B): The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(~B): The prior probability that a random person in the city is not black (white), which is 0.85 (85%).
P(W|~B): The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

{probability: 0.4138}
