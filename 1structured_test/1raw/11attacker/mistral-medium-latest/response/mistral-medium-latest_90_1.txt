To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula to calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(Black|Identified as black)).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Black|Identified as black) = [P(Identified as black|Black) \* P(Black)] / [P(Identified as black|Black) \* P(Black) + P(Identified as black|White) \* P(White)]

From the information provided:

P(Identified as black|Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(Identified as black|White) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(Black) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
P(White) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(Black|Identified as black) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4167

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4167.
