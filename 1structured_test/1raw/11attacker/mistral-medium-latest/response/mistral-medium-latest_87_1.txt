To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B | W) = [P(W | B) \* P(B)] / [P(W | B) \* P(B) + P(W | not B) \* P(not B)]

where:

* P(B | W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony
* P(W | B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
* P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black
* P(W | not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
* P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black

From the information given, we can assign the following values:

* P(W | B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
* P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
* P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

To find P(W | not B), we can use the following formula: P(W | not B) = 1 - P(not W | not B), where P(not W | not B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time when the person is actually white. Therefore:

* P(not W | not B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person 80% of the time)
* P(W | not B) = 1 - P(not W | not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B | W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B | W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B | W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city is approximately 0.4138.
