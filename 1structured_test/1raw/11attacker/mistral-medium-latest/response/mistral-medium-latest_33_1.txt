To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Here, event A is the witness identifying the attacker as black, and event B is the attacker being black.

1. Prior probability P(B): The attacker being black. According to the information, P(B) = 0.15 (15%)
2. Prior probability P(not B): The attacker not being black (i.e., being white). P(not B) = 0.85 (85%)
3. Likelihood P(A|B): The witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. In the given data, P(A|B) = 0.80 (80%)
4. Likelihood P(A|not B): The witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). P(A|not B) = 0.20 (20%)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(B|A) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4091 or 40.91%

However, the question asks for the answer in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}:
{probability: 0.4091}
