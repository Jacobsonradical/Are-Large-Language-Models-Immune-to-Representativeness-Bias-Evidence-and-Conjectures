To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are actually black. This is equal to 0.8 according to the information provided.
- P(B) is the probability that a random attacker is black. Given that 15% of the population is black, this value is 0.15.
- P(not B) is the probability that a random attacker is not black. As 85% of the population is white, this value is 0.85.
- P(A|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are actually white. This is equal to 0.2 according to the information provided.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.417

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.417.
