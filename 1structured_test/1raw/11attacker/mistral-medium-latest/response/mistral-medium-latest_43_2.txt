To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of a person being black, which is 0.15 based on the information provided.
P(W) as the prior probability of a person being white, which is 0.85.
P(E|B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black, which is 0.8.
P(E|W) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are white, which is 0.2.

Now we want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) \* P(B)] / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Plug in the values:

P(B|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the numerator:

0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Calculate the denominator:

(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
