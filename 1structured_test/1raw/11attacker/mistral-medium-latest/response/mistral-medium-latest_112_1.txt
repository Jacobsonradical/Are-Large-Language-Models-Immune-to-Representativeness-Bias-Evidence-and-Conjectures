This is a classic example of Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate it:

Let's denote:

H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. According to Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

From the problem statement, we know that:

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 1.0 (If the attacker is black, the witness will always identify them as black, given that they have a 100% success rate when the person is black)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness errs 20% of the time when the person is white, so they incorrectly identify a white person as black in 20% of the cases)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and ~H)
     = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
       â‰ˆ 0.4091 or 40.91%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4091.
