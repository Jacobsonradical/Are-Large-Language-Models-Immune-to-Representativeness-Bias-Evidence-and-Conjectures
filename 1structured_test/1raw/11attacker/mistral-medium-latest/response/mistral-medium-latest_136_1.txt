To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (event B) given that the witness identified them as black (evidence A).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) \* P(B)] / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|not B) \* P(not B)]

Let's break it down:

1. P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black before any new evidence is taken into account. From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population is black, so P(B) = 0.15.
2. P(not B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. P(A|B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are indeed black. The witness correctly identifies black individuals 80% of the time, so P(A|B) = 0.8.
4. P(A|not B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black. The witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying non-black individuals, so P(A|not B) = 0.2.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.409

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.409.
