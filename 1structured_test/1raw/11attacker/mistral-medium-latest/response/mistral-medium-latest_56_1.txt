To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (probability of being black in the population)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability of not being black in the population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Now, we can substitute the given values and calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3846
