To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the racial distribution in the city, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
H: The attacker is black
E: The witness identified the attacker as black
P(H): Prior probability of H, i.e., the probability that a random person in the city is black = 0.15
P(¬H): Prior probability of not H, i.e., the probability that a random person in the city is white = 0.85
P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
P(E|¬H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are white = 0.2 (from the witness's inaccuracy)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plug in the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.4138
