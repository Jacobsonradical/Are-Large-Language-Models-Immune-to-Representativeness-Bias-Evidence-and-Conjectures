This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs (in this case, the racial demographics of the city) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the racial demographics of the city.
- P(W|B) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate.
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, which is what we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W) as follows:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

First, we need to find P(W|not B), which is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). Based on the witness's accuracy rate, this is 0.2 (since they err in 20% of the cases).

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%

However, it's essential to note that eyewitness testimony can be unreliable, and this calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy rate is consistent across all individuals and situations. In reality, various factors could influence the witness's accuracy, and this estimate should be considered in conjunction with other available evidence.
