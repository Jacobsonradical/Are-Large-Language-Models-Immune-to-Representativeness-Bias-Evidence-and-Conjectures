To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (P(B)) given that the witness identified them as black (P(W|B)). We have the following information:

1. P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
3. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
4. P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.

{probability: 0.41}
