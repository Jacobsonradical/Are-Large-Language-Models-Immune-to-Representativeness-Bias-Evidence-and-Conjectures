To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, in this case, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black (P(B|W)) and the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black (P(W|B)).

First, let's calculate P(W|B) and P(W|not B):
P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the information given)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Next, let's find the prior probabilities, P(B) and P(not B), based on the population percentages:
P(B) = 0.15
P(not B) = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|not B) \* P(not B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4091 or 40.91%

Note that this is an estimate based on the information provided and should not be taken as absolute certainty. In the requested format:

{probability: 0.4091}
