To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

Since the witness has an equal chance of encountering a white or black person in the sample, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (C) as follows:
P(C) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and half of these errors involve misidentifying a white person)

Now, we can find P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black:
P(B|not A) = P(C) = 0.2

Finally, we can find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (B) by law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) ≈ 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23
P(A|B) ≈ 0.522

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.522 or 52.2%.
