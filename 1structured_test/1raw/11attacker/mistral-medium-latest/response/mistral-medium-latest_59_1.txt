To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population demographics.
P(W) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(I|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(I|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(B|I), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4091 or 40.91%

But the question asks for the probability in a format between 0 and 1, so the final answer is:

{probability: 0.4091}
