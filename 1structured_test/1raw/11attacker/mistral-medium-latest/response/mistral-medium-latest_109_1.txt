To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
W: The witness's testimony

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

First, let's find the prior probabilities, P(H) and P(~H):

Since 15% of the population is black and 85% is white:
P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85

Next, we need to find P(W|H) and P(W|~H):

The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so:
P(W|H) = 0.80

The witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, so:
P(W|~H) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
P(W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.5217

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.5217.
