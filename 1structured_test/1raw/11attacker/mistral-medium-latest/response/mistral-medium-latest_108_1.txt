To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on information "a".
- P(W|B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is 1, since the witness always correctly identifies black people when they are indeed black.
- P(W|¬B) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. This value is 0.2, based on information "b".
- P(¬B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85 based on information "a".

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|¬B) \* P(¬B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (1 \* 0.15) / [(1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

This simplifies to:

P(B|W) ≈ 0.42857 or 42.86%

However, since we are asked to provide an estimate between 0 and 1, the answer should be:

{probability: 0.42857}
