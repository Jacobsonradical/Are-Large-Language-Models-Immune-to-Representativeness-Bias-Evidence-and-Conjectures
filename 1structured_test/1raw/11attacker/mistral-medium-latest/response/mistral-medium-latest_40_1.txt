To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on information (a).
P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(I|B) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black, which is 0.8 (80%) based on information (b).
P(I|W) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that they are white, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(B|I), the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = [P(I|B) \* P(B)] / [P(I|B) \* P(B) + P(I|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the values:
P(B|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.409 or 40.9%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.409.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.409}
