To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (the probability of identifying a black person correctly)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (the probability of misidentifying a white person as black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of a person being black in the city)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability of a person being white in the city)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|W) × P(W))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|I) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.120 / (0.120 + 0.170)
       = 0.120 / 0.290
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics of the city, is approximately 0.414.
