To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- B: the attacker is black
- I: the witness identified the attacker as black

We need to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a person being black in the city)
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
- P(I|not B) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|not B) × P(not B))

P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:

P(B|I) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
