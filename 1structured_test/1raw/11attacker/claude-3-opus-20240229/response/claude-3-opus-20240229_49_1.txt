To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the given information:
P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
P(W|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(W|not B) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / (P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|not B) × P(not B))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.120 / (0.120 + 0.170)
       = 0.120 / 0.290
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
