To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- B: The attacker is black
- W: The attacker is white
- I: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black based on city demographics)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white based on city demographics)
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black)

We want to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) * P(B)) / (P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
