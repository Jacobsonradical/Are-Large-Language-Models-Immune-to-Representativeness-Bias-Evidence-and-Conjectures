To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the probability of identifying a black person correctly)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the probability of misidentifying a white person as black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person being black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person being white)

We want to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) * P(B)) / (P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
