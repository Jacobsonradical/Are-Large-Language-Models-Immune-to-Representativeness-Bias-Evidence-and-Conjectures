To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The attacker is white
I: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is black)
P(I|W) = 0.20 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is white)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population)
P(W) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white, based on the city's population)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) * P(B)) / (P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
