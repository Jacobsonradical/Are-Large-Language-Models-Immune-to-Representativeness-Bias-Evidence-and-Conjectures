To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person from the city is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
