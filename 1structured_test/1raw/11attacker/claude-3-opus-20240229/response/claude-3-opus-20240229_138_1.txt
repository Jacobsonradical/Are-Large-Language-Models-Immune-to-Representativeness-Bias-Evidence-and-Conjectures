To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability that a person in the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability that a person in the city is white)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
