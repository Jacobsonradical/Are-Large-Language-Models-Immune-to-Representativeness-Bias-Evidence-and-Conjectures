To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))

Given:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white)

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
