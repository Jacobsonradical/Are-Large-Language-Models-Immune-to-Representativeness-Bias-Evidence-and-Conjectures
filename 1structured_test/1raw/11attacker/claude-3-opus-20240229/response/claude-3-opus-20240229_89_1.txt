To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given:
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is black)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is white)
- P(B) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population)
- P(W) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white, based on the city's population)

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) * P(B)) / (P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
      = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
