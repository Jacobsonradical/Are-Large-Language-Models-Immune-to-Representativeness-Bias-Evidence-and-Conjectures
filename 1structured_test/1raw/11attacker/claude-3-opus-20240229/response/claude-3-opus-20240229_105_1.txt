To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black based on city demographics)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white based on city demographics)
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black)

We want to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|W) × P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.120 / (0.120 + 0.170)
       = 0.120 / 0.290
       ≈ 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
