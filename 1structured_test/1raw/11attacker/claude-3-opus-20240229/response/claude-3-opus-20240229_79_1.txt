To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- B: The attacker is black
- W: The attacker is white
- I: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the given information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white)
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|W) × P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
