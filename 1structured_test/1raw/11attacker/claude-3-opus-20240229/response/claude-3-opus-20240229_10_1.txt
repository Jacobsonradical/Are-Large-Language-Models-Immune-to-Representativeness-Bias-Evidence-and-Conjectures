To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a person being black in the city)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
