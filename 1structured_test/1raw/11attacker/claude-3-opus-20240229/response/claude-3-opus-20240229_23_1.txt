To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- B: The attacker is black
- W: The attacker is white
- I: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black based on city demographics)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white based on city demographics)
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is black)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is white)

We want to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
