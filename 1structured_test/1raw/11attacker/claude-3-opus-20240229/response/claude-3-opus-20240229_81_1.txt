To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a random person from the city being black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
