To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We have:
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person from the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
