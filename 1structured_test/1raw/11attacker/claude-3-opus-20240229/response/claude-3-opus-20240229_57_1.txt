To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The attacker is white
I: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to calculate P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Given:
P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414
