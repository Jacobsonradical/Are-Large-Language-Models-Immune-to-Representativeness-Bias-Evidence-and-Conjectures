To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Given:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of a person being black in the city is 15%)
- P(not B) = 0.85 (the probability of a person being white in the city is 85%)

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
