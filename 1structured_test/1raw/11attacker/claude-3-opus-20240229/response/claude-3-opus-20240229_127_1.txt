To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (probability of identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white)
- P(B) = 0.15 (probability that a random person from the city is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (probability that a random person from the city is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|W) × P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|I) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
