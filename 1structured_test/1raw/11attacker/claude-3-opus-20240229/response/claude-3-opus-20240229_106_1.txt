To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
P(W|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(W|not B) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability of a random person in the city being black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))

P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
