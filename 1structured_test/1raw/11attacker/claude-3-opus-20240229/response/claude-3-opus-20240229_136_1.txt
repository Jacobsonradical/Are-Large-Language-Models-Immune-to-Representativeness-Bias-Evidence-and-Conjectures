To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the given information:
P(B) = 0.15 (probability that a random person from the city is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))

P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
