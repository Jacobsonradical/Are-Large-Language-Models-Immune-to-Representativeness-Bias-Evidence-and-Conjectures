To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is stated as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Here, 
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are actually black.
- \(P(W)\) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given that:
- \(P(W|B) = 0.8\) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).
- \(P(W|W) = 0.2\) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Now, we need to compute \(P(W)\), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Where:
- \(P(W)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, or 0.85 (85% of the population).

Thus:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

This means the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Representing this in the requested format:
