To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our probability estimation based on new evidence. We will need to consider:

1. The prior probabilities:
   - Probability that a randomly selected individual is white (P(W)) = 0.85
   - Probability that a randomly selected individual is black (P(B)) = 0.15

2. The likelihood of evidence given each hypothesis:
   - The probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black (P(ID_black | B)) = 0.80
   - The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black (P(ID_black | W)) = 0.20

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = P(B | ID\_black) = \frac{P(ID\_black | B) \times P(B)}{P(ID\_black)} \]

Where:
\[ P(ID\_black) = P(ID\_black | B) \times P(B) + P(ID\_black | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(ID\_black) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(ID\_black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug this back into Bayes' formula to find P(B | ID_black):
\[ P(B | ID\_black) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | ID\_black) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, our answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
