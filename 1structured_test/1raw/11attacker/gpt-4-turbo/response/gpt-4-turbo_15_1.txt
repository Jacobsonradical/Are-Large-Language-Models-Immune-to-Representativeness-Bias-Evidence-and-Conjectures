To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability a randomly chosen person from the population (the attacker) is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|W') = 0.2 \) (the witness identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where \( W' \) is the event "the person is white")
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

The probability \( P(W) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as black can be computed via the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W') \cdot P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
