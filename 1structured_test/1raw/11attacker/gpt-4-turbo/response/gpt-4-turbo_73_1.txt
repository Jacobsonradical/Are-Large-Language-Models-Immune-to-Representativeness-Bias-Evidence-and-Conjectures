To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be represented as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This value is 0.8 based on witness accuracy.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black, based on the demographic distribution of the city, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be computed by adding:
  - The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, \( P(W|B) \times P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 \).
  - The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, \( P(W|W') \times P(W') \), where \( P(W') \) is the probability the attacker is white (0.85), and \( P(W|W') \) is the error rate of 0.2.

Now, let's calculate each component:

\[ P(W|B) \times P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(W|W') \times P(W') = 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting these into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the person as black and considering racial demographics and witness accuracy is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
