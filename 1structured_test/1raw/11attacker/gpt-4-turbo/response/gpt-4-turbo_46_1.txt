To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \(B\) as the event that the attacker is black,
- \(W\) as the event that the attacker is white,
- \(I_B\) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information, we know:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black),
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white),
- \(P(I_B|B) = 0.80\) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black),
- \(P(I_B|W) = 0.20\) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is white).

Bayes’ theorem states:
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{P(I_B|B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

To find \(P(I_B)\) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B|B) \times P(B) + P(I_B|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification under the conditions described is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
