To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where 
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is black (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black.

The witness correctly identifies someone's race 80% of the time, so:
- \( P(W|B) \) ("probability witness correctly identifies attacker as black if attacker is black") = 0.80
- \( P(W|W) \) ("probability witness mistakenly identifies attacker as black if attacker is white") = 0.20

We calculate \( P(W) \) (the general probability of a witness saying a person is black) using total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138. 

In the desired format:
{"probability": 0.4138}
