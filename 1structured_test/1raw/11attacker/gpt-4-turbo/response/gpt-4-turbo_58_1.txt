To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the racial composition of the city, and our new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( D \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white).
- \( P(D|B) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually black).
- \( P(D|W) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that the person is actually white).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to compute \( P(B|D) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \times P(B)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D|B) \times P(B) + P(D|W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging these values back into Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[
P(B|D) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, based on the given information and the calculations:

{probability: 0.4138}
