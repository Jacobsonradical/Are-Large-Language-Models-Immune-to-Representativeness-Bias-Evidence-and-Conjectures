To estimate the probability that the attacker is black using the given information, we utilize Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our probabilities given new evidence. Let's define:

- \( B \) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the probability that the attacker is white.
- \( A_B \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- \( A_W \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as white.

From the information given:
- With an 85% white and 15% black population: 
  - \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(W) = 0.85 \)

Next, the witness's accuracy:
- Correctly identifies race 80% of the time:
  - \( P(A_B | B) = 0.8 \) (correctly identifies as black when they are black)
  - \( P(A_W | W) = 0.8 \) (correctly identifies as white when they are white)
- Incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time:
  - \( P(A_B | W) = 0.2 \) (incorrectly identifies as black when they are white)
  - \( P(A_W | B) = 0.2 \) (incorrectly identifies as white when they are black)

We are asked for the probability \( P(B | A_B) \) â€“ the probability that the attacker is black, given that the attacker was identified as black:

\[
P(B | A_B) = \frac{P(A_B | B) \times P(B)}{P(A_B)}
\]

Where \( P(A_B) \) is found using the total probability formula:
\[
P(A_B) = P(A_B | B) \times P(B) + P(A_B | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(A_B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So, substituting back:
\[
P(B | A_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, using the information available and considering the witness's accuracy:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
