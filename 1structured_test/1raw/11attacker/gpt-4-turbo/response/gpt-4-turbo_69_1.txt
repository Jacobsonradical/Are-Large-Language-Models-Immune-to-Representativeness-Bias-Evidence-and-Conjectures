To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence from the witness and the racial composition of the city, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

1. **Define the probabilities**:
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \( W \) be the event where the witness correctly identifies the race of the person.

2. **Known probabilities**:
   - The probability that a person is black in the city (prior probability, \( P(B) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
   - The probability that a person is not black (therefore white in this case) is 85%, or 0.85.
   - The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as black if they are indeed black (\( P(W | B) \)) is 80%, or 0.8.
   - The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black when they are not (actually white) (\( P(W | \neg B) \)) is 20%, or 0.2.

3. **Calculate the probability witness says the person is black**:
   - The total probability that the witness identifies someone as black (whether they are black or not) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(W) = P(W | B) P(B) + P(W | \neg B) P(\neg B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
          = 0.12 + 0.17
          = 0.29
     \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' Theorem states:
     \[
     P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) P(B)}{P(W)}
             = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
             â‰ˆ 0.4138
     \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.
