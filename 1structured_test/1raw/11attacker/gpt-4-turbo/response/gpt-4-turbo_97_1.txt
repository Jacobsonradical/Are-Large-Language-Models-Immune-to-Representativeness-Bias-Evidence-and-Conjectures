To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem will help us update our probabilities based on the new information provided by the witness.

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \(A\) denote the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \(B\) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Known probabilities:**
   - **Prior Probability (\(P(A)\)):** This is the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's identification. As 15% of the population is black, \(P(A) = 0.15\).
   - **Probability of being white (\(P(A^c)\)):** As 85% of the population is white, \(P(A^c) = 0.85\).
   - **Probability that the witness identifies someone as black given they are black (\(P(B|A)\)):** This is the accuracy of the witness in identifying black individuals, which is 80% or 0.8.
   - **Probability that the witness identifies someone as black given they are white (\(P(B|A^c)\)):** This is the error rate of the witness in identifying white individuals as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   Where \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. It can be computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4138}
