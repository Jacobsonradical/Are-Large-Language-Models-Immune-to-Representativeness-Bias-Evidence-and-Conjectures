To determine the probability that the attacker is black (\( P(B) \)), given that a witness identified the attacker as black (\( W \)), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given that the witness said the attacker is black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black).
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white).

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(W|\neg B) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

The total probability of the witness saying the attacker is black (by the law of total probability) is:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|\neg B) \times P(\neg B) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified him as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the output provided should be:
{probability: 0.4138}
