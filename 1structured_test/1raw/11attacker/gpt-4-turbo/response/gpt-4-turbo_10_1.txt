To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness’s testimony and the racial composition of the city, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based upon new evidence.

1. **Let's define the events:**
   - B: Attacker is black.
   - W: Witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Prior Probability (P(B)):**
   From the population statistics provided:
   \[ P(B) = 0.15 \]
   (15% of the population is black.)

3. **Witness accuracy (P(W|B) and P(W|¬B)):**
   - P(W|B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).
   - P(W|¬B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time).

4. **Marginal Probability of W (P(W)):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|¬B)P(¬B) \]
   \[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

5. **Posterior Probability (P(B|W)):**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B)P(B)}{P(W)} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, given the evidence and demographics:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
