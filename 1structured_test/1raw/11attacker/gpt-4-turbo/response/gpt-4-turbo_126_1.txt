To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. The hypothesis here is that the attacker is black. Let's denote two events:

- B: the event that the attacker is black.
- W: the event that the attacker is white (i.e., not black).
- A: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- P(B) = probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- P(W) = probability that the attacker is white = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
- P(A|B) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.80.
- P(A|W) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white = 0.20.

We are looking for P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)} \]

P(A), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
