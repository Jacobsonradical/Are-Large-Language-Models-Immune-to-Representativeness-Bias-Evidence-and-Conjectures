To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given that they are actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Since 15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black which is \(0.20\) (The witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time).
- \( P(W) \) can be found using total probability theorem:
  \[ P(W) = P(W|B) P(B) + P(W|W) P(W) \]
  \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
