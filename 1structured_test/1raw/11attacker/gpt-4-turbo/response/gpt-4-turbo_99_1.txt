We can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem:

Let A be the event that the attacker is black. Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the population distribution): 15% or 0.15
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white): 85% or 0.85
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black: 80% or 0.8
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white: 20% or 0.2

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimated probability is: {probability: 0.4138}
