To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we use Bayesian reasoning. Here's how we compute it:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
   - \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

2. **Accuracy of Witness Identification**:
   - The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, whether the person is black or white.
   - Thus:
     - \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black} \mid \text{Black}) = 0.8 \)
     - \( P(\text{Witness identifies as White} \mid \text{White}) = 0.8 \)
   - Error rates are 20%:
     - \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black} \mid \text{White}) = 0.2 \)
     - \( P(\text{Witness identifies as White} \mid \text{Black}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We want to find \( P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness identifies as Black}) \)
   - Bayes' Theorem states:
     \[
     P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness identifies as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness identifies as Black} \mid \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Witness identifies as Black})}
     \]
   - Calculating \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black}) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race):
     \[
     P(\text{Witness identifies as Black}) = P(\text{Witness identifies as Black} \mid \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Witness identifies as Black} \mid \text{White}) \times P(\text{White})
     \]
     \[
     = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]

4. **Substitute back to find the posterior probability**:
   \[
   P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Witness identifies as Black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.

**Answer**: {probability: 0.414}
