To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we will use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time, this value is 0.8.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \), which is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is black, considering both when the attacker actually is black, and when the attacker is not black (in this case, white):

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Given the witnessâ€™s error rate of 20%, this value is 0.2.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).

Thus:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
