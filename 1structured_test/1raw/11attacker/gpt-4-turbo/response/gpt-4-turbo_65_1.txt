To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is black.
- \(P(W)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given data:
- \(P(W|B) = 0.8\) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black)

We also need \(P(W|W')\), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20%, or 0.2. Therefore:
- \(P(W|W') = 0.2\) 

The probability that a person is white is 85%, so \(P(W') = 0.85\).

Now, we calculate \(P(W)\), the overall probability that the witness identifies the person as black:
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W') \times P(W')
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, return to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the requested answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
