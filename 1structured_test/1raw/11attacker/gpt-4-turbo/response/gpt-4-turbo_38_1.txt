To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating our probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's denote the following:

- Let \(B\) be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \(W\) be the event that the attacker is white.
- Let \(I\) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as black.

Based on the information provided:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (prior probability that the attacker is black based on population ratio)
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (prior probability that the attacker is white)

The witness can either accurately identify the racial identity of a person or make an error. The probabilities are:
- \(P(I|B) = 0.80\) (probability of correctly identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black)
- \(P(I|W) = 0.20\) (probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white)

By Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \times P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Here, \(P(I)\) is the total probability of someone being identified as black, which includes both the probability of correctly and incorrectly identifying the person as black. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \times P(B) + P(I|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.

Answer: {"probability": 0.414}
