To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can employ Bayesâ€™ theorem. Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) denote the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

We need to calculate \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is actually black, which is 0.80.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness stating the attacker is black.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|B^c) \times P(B^c)
\]

Where:
- \( B^c \) is the event that the attacker is not black (hence, white, assuming only black and white populations for simplicity).
- \( P(B^c) \) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).
- \( P(W|B^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white, which is 0.20.

Thus,
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
