To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified them as black, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W \mid B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) and \( P(W) \) are the prior probabilities of the attacker being black and a witness identifying the attacker as black, respectively.

From the given data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(\text{not } B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Further, we understand from the data:
- \( P(W \mid B) = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy of identifying as black when the person is truly black)
- \( P(W \mid \text{not } B) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate or likelihood of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Now we find \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid B) \times P(B) + P(W \mid \text{not } B) \times P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore:
{probability: 0.414}
