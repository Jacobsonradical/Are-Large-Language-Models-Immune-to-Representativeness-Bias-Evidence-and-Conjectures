To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial demographic of the city, I'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Black}|\text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Black}|\text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identified as Black})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Black}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black}|\text{Black}) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as being black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black}) \) is the total probability that any person is identified as black by the witness. This can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = P(\text{Identified as Black}|\text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identified as Black}|\text{White}) \times P(\text{White}) \]

Here:
- \( P(\text{White}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black}|\text{White}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as being black, which is 20% or 0.2.

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Black}|\text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
