To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in its simplest form states: 

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(A) \) is the initial probability the attacker is black (prior probability).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is black).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness identifies the attacker as black correctly 80% of the time when the attacker is actually black).

\( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (white), which should be the probability of a mistake in identifying race, is \( 0.20 \).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is white).

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (\( P(B) \)) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately:
{
  "probability": 0.4138
