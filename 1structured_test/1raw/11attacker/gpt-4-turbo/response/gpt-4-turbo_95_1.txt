To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update our initial belief (prior probability) about an event based on new evidence (likelihood) to give an updated belief (posterior probability).

Let us define:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know the following:
- The prior probabilities based on population distribution:
  - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
  - \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- The likelihoods of the witness identifying someone as black:
  - \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies black)
  - \( P(W | \neg B) = 0.2 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

We calculate \( P(W) \) (the total probability of witness identifying as black) as:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | \neg B) \times P(\neg B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
