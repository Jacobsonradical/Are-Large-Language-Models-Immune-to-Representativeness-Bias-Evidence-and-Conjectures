To estimate the probability that the attacker was black given the information from the witness and the population demographics, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as black if the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability a randomly chosen person from the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(W|B) \) is 0.8 (80% accuracy if the attacker is actually black).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|W) \) is 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).

The total probability \( P(W) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as black can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.

Answer: {probability: 0.414}
