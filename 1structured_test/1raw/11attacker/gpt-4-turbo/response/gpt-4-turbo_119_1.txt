To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( D \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Probability attacker is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Probability attacker is white)
  
For the witness's ability to identify race:
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies black (\( B \)): \( P(D|B) = 0.8 \)
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies white as black \( P(D|W) \): Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, and the test scenario involves an equal representation of races, the probability that they incorrectly identify a white person as black should also be 20%. Hence, \( P(D|W) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem, we calculate \( P(B|D) \) (probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black):

\[
P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \times P(B)}{P(D|B) \times P(B) + P(D|W) \times P(W)}
\]

Inserting the values,
\[
P(B|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

So in answer format:
{probability: 0.4138}
