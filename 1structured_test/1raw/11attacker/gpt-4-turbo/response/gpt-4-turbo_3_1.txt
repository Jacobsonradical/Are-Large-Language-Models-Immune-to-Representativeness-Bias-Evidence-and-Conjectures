To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(B\) be the event "The attacker is black".
- \(W\) be the event "The attacker is white".
- \(A\) be the event "The witness identifies the attacker as black".

According to the problem:
- Probability that the attacker is black based on population data: \(P(B) = 0.15\)
- Probability that the attacker is white: \(P(W) = 0.85\)
- The witness's ability to correctly identify the attacker as black: \(P(A|B) = 0.8\)
- The witness's error rate in identifying someone black when they are actually white: \(P(A|W) = 0.2\)

We want to find \(P(B|A)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

To calculate \(P(A)\), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W)
\]
\[
P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
