To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Here are the relevant probabilities given:
- Prior probability that the attacker is white (P(W)): 85% or 0.85.
- Prior probability that the attacker is black (P(B)): 15% or 0.15.
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white (P(correct|white)): 80% or 0.8.
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (P(incorrect|white)): 20% or 0.2.
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (P(correct|black)): 80% or 0.8.
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white (P(incorrect|black)): 20% or 0.2.

We need to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (P(B|witness says black)).

Application of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|witness\, says\, black) = \frac{P(witness\, says\, black|B) \times P(B)}{P(witness\, says\, black)} \]

We already have:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(witness\, says\, black|B) = 0.8 \)

We need to calculate \( P(witness\, says\, black) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black:

\[ P(witness\, says\, black) = P(witness\, says\, black|B) \times P(B) + P(witness\, says\, black|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|witness\, says\, black) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.41379 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification under those conditions, is approximately 0.414.
