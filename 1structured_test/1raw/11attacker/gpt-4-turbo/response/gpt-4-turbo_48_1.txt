To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. 

1. Let B be the event that the attacker is black.
2. Let W be the event that the attacker is white.
3. Let "Identified as Black" be event A—where a witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to calculate P(B | A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the attacker was identified as black.

From the information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability the attacker is black, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability the attacker is white, since 85% of the population is white)

According to the witness's ability:
- P(A | B) = 0.80 (probability witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black)
- P(A | W) = 0.20 (probability witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where P(A) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(A) = P(A | B) \times P(B) + P(A | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.29 \]

Now plug the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | A) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | A) ≈ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.
