To estimate the probability that the attacker is black (\(B\) = black attacker), given that the witness identified the attacker as black (\(W\) = witness claims black), we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(B | W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's claim.
- \(P(W | B)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is black.

From the information:
- \(P(W | B) = 0.8\) (80% chance of correct identification if the attacker is black).
- \(P(W | B^c)\) = 0.2 (20% chance of wrongfully claiming the attacker is black when they are not).
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black).
- \(P(B^c) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white).

Calculate \(P(W)\) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | B^c) \times P(B^c) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \}
\]
