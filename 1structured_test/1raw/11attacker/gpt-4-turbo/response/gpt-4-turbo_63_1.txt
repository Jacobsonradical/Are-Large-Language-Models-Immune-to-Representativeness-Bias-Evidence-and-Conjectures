To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence. In this case, it helps to incorporate the reliability of the witness's identification.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is black (\( P(A) \)) in the city is 15% or 0.15.
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is white (\( P(A^c) \)), where \( A^c \) is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white), is 85% or 0.85.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (\( P(B|A) \)) is 80% or 0.8.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (\( P(B|A^c) \)) is 20% or 0.2.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is:

  "probability": 0.4138
