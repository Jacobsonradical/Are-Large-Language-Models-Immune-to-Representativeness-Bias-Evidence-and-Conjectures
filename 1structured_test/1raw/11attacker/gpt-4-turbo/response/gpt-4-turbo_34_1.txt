To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem combines prior probability with new evidence to give a revised probability.

Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) represent the event that the attacker is white.

Given:
- Prior probability \( P(B) \) (the probability the attacker is black based on population) = 15% = 0.15.
- Prior probability \( P(W) \) (the probability the attacker is white based on population) = 85% = 0.85.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as black \( P(\text{Identify Black} \mid B) \) = 80% = 0.8.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black \( P(\text{Identify Black} \mid W) \) = 20% = 0.2.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B \mid \text{Identify Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identify Black} \mid B) P(B)}{P(\text{Identify Black})} \]

where:
\[ P(\text{Identify Black}) = P(\text{Identify Black} \mid B) P(B) + P(\text{Identify Black} \mid W) P(W) \]
\[ P(\text{Identify Black}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identify Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B \mid \text{Identify Black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid \text{Identify Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
