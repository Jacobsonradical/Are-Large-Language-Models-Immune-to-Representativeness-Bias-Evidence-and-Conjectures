To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witnessâ€™s identification and the racial composition of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black. According to the information, this probability is 0.80, as the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is black, which is 0.15 (or 15%).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which needs to be calculated using total probability theorem: 

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|\neg B) \times P(\neg B) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use these values to compute \( P(B|W) \):
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification and population data, is approximately 0.41.
