To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We also need to calculate \( P(W) \), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, whether the attacker is actually black or not:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|W) \) is the probability of misidentifying a white person as black, i.e., \( 0.2 \) (the error rate for the witness).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
