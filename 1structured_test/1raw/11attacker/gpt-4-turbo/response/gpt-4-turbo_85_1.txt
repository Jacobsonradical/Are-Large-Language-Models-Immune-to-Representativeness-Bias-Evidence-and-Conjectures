To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population racial distribution, we use Bayes' theorem:

Let:
B = Attacker is black
W = Attacker is white
E = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We need to calculate P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the city is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.80 (80% correct identification rate when the attacker is black)
- P(E|W) = 0.20 (20% error rate, identifying the attacker as black when they are actually white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \times P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, calculated through the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \times P(B) + P(E|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, given the witness's testimony and population statistics:
{probability: 0.4138}
