First, let's define our events:
- \( B \) = attacker is black
- \( W \) = attacker is white
- \( I_B \) = attacker is identified as black by the witness
- \( I_W \) = attacker is identified as white by the witness

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is white)
- \( P(I_B | B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(I_W | B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies black person as white 20% of the time)
- \( P(I_B | W) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies white person as black 20% of the time)
- \( P(I_W | W) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies white person 80% of the time)

Applying Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability of the attacker being identified as black. We use the law of total probability for this:

\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \times P(B) + P(I_B | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4137 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the attacker was identified as black by the witness, is about 0.414.
