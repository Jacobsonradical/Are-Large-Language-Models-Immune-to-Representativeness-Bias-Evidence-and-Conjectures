To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate the likelihood that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, as well as the prior probability of an attacker being black, and update our beliefs based on the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
  
Given:
- Prior probabilities based on the population: \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
- The witness's accuracy: If the person is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as black is 80%. Similarly, the probability that the witness wrongly identifies a white person as black is also 20% (given that they make an error in identifying race 20% of the time overall).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(I_B | B) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are black)
- \( P(I_B | W) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are white)
  
And \( P(I_B) \) can be calculated using total probability:
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now, plugging it back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
