To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. Here is how you would compute it:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
   - \( P(\bar{B}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).

2. **Accuracy of the Witness**:
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
   - The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's race, therefore:
     - \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness says black given the attacker is black).
     - \( P(W|\bar{B}) = 0.2 \) (probability witness says black given the attacker is white).

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We want to find \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black:
     \[
     P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
     \]
   - To find \( P(W) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black):
     \[
     P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|\bar{B}) \times P(\bar{B})
     \]
     \[
     P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]
   - Now, use Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
     \]

**Conclusion**:
The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black under the specified conditions, is approximately 0.414.
