To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update prior probability with new evidence to get a posterior probability. Hereâ€™s how we can compute it:

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black. Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to the problem:
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is black (\( P(B) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is white (\( P(\text{not } B) \)) is 85%, or 0.85.
- The witness identifies black people correctly as black 80% of the time, so \( P(W \mid B) = 0.8 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, so \( P(W \mid \text{not } B) = 0.2 \).

We use Bayes' theorem as follows:
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid B)\cdot P(B) + P(W \mid \text{not } B)\cdot P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and considering the witness's accuracy and the demographics of the city, is approximately 0.414.
