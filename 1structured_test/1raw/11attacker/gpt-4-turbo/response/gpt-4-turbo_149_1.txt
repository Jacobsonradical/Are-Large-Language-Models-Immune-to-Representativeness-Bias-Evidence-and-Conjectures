To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability based on new evidence. Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black, and \( W \) represent the event that the attacker is white. Let \( E \) represent the event that a witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know the following:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
  - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

- The witness's accuracy:
  - The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. Therefore, if the attacker is black, the witness identifies them as black 80% of the time:
    \( P(E \mid B) = 0.8 \)
  - If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies them as black is 20%:
    \( P(E \mid W) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can compute the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (\( P(B \mid E) \)):

\[
P(B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E \mid B) \times P(B) + P(E \mid W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting the values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4138.
