To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, I will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let \(B\) represent the event that the attacker is black. Let \(W\) represent the event of identifying as black (given by the witness).

**Given:**
- The population probability of being black, \(P(B) = 0.15\).
- The population probability of being white, \(P(\text{not } B) = P(W) = 0.85\).
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone's race (true positive rate) is 80%, hence \(P(W \mid B) = 0.8\).
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone's race (false positive rate) is 20%. Since there are equal chances of being white or black when assessed, we take half as the base rate for each race for the witness test. Thus, \(P(W \mid \text{not } B) = 0.2\).

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

First, compute the unconditional probability \(P(W)\) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(W \mid \text{not } B) \cdot P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
