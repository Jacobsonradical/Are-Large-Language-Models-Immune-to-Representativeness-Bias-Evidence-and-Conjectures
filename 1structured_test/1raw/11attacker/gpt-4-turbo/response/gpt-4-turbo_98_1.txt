To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps in updating our initial belief (based on population data) about the probability of an event (attacker being black) in light of new evidence (witness's testimony).

Let:
- \(B\) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we know that:
- The probability that the attacker is black based on population data, \(P(B)\), is 15%, so \(P(B) = 0.15\).
- The probability that the attacker is white, \(P(B^c)\), is therefore 85%, so \(P(B^c) = 0.85\).
- The witness correctly identifies a black person as being black 80% of the time, so \(P(W | B) = 0.8\).
- The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so \(P(W | B^c) = 0.2\).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)}
\]
where \(P(W)\) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given by:
\[
P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | B^c) \cdot P(B^c)
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B | W) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is about 0.4138, or 41.38%.

The answer in the requested format is:
