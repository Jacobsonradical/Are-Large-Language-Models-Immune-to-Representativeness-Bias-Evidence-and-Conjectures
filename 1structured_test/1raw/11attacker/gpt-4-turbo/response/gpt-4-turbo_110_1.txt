To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population racial distribution, we can use Bayesian updating. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(B) \) (prior probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W | B) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black) = 0.80 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals).
- \( P(W | B^c) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is not black, i.e., the attacker is white) = 0.20 (since the witness makes a mistake in 20% of cases).
- \( P(B^c) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

The total probability \( P(W) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as black can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | B^c) \times P(B^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plugging all values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population data is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
