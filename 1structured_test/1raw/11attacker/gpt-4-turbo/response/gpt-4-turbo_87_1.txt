To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence. 

Let B represent the event the attacker is black, and W represent the event the attacker is white. Let E represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. 

From the information provided:

- Prior probabilities (based on population statistics):
  - P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
  - P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

- The witness's accuracy:
  - P(E | B) = 0.80 (probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
  - P(E | W) = 0.20 (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we find P(B | E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \times P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as black) can be found by the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \times P(B) + P(E | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, plug these into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138. 

Answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
