To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps in updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white (i.e., \( W = B^c \), the complement of \( B \)). Additionally, let \( E \) be the event corresponding to the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We know:
- Prior probabilities from the population distribution: \( P(B) = 0.15 \) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \).
- The witness's accuracy: \( P(E | B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black) and \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).

We want to find \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \times P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

\[
P(E) = P(E | B) \times P(B) + P(E | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B | E) \):

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
