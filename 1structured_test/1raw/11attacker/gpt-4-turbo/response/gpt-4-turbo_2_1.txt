To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know:
- (P(B) = 0.15) This is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black (15% of the population).
- (P(B^c) = 0.85) This is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is not black (85% of the population).
- (P(W|B) = 0.80) This is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are actually black (the witness identifies correctly 80% of the time).
- (P(W|B^c) = 0.20) This is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are not black (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|B^c) \cdot P(B^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, plug these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
