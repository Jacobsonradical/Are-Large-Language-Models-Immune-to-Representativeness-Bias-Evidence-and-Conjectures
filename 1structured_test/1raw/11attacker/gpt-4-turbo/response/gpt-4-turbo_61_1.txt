To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in updating our prior belief about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

According to the problem:
- The prior probability that the attacker is black (P(B)) is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).
- The probability that the attacker is white (P(B^c)) is 85% or 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white).
- Given that the attacker is black, the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black (P(W|B)) is 80% or 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time).
- Given that the attacker is white, the probability that the witness still identifies the attacker as black (P(W|B^c)) is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|B^c) \times P(B^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Plugging values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, given the information we have, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
