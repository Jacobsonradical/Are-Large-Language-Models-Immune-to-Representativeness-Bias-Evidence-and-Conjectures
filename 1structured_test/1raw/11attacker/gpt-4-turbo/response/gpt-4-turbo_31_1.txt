To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the setup:

Let \( B \) denote the event that the attacker is black, and let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white. Let \( A \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to the problem:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(A | B) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
- \( P(A | W) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, calculated by:
  \[
  P(A) = P(A | B) P(B) + P(A | W) P(W)
  \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Converted to a probability:

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
