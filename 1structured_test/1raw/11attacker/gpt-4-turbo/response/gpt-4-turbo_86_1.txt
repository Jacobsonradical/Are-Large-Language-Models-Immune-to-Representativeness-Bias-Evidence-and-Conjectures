To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which updates our belief about the likelihood of an event (in this case, that the attacker is black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define:
- \(B = \) the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W = \) the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we know:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population).
- \(P(\neg B) = 0.85\) (prior probability that the attacker is not black).
- \(P(W|B) = 0.8\) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black).
- \(P(W|\neg B) = 0.2\) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually not black).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \(P(W)\) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|\neg B)P(\neg B)
\]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately \(0.4138\).
