To solve this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the identification provided by a witness.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- The population ratio is such that \( P(B) = 0.15 \) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \).
- The witness's accuracy is such that they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. This witness accuracy applies to both identifying black and white individuals under the test conditions.

Then we have:
- \( P(I | B) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies a black attacker).
- \( P(I | W) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black).

We want to find \( P(B | I) \), the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
\]

To find \( P(I) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(I) = P(I | B) \times P(B) + P(I | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(I) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Formally answering in the required format:

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
