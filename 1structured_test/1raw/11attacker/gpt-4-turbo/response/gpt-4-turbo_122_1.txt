To estimate the probability that the attacker was black given the evidence, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified him as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black when the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the population ratio).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Given data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifying a black person as black).
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black).
- \( P(W) \) (the total probability of witness stating the attacker is black) is calculated by:
  \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is about 0.414.
