To answer this question, we can use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs about the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the demographics of the area.

1. **Prior Probability (Pr[B])**: Before considering the testimony, the probability that the attacker is black, based primarily on the population ratio, is 15%. Thus, Pr[B] = 0.15.

2. **Probability that the Witness Correctly Identifies a Black Attacker (Pr[W|B])**: The witness can correctly identify someone as black 80% of the time; hence, Pr[W|B] = 0.8.

3. **Probability that the Attacker is White (Pr[W'])**: Since 85% of the population is white, Pr[W'] = 0.85.

4. **Probability that the Witness Incorrectly Identifies a White Attacker as Black (Pr[W|W'])**: The witness mistakenly identifies someone as black 20% of the time, hence Pr[W|W'] = 0.2.

With these probabilities, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{Pr}[B|W] = \frac{\text{Pr}[W|B] \times \text{Pr}[B]}{\text{Pr}[W|B] \times \text{Pr}[B] + \text{Pr}[W|W'] \times \text{Pr}[W']} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Pr}[B|W] = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ \text{Pr}[B|W] = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ \text{Pr}[B|W] = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \text{Pr}[B|W] \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the demographic data, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.4138}
