To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's how you can calculate it:

Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
Let \( W \) be the witness's identification that the attacker is black.

From the problem:
- The probability that a given person is black (prior probability, \( P(B) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The probability that a given person is white (prior probability, \( P(¬B) \)), is 85%, or 0.85.
- If the person is actually black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black (true positive rate, \( P(W|B) \)), is 80%, or 0.8.
- If the person is white, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies them as black (false positive rate, \( P(W|¬B) \)), is 20%, or 0.2.

We need to find \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness identifies the person as black, can be calculated by the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|¬B) \times P(¬B)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification under these specific conditions.
