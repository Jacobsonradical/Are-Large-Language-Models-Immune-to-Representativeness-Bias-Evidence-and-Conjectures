To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement and the known population demographics, we employ Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \( B \) denote the event that the attacker is black.
- \( \neg B \) denote the event that the attacker is white.
- \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(W \mid B) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid \neg B) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(B \mid W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(B \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

We need \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We calculate it using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B) + P(W \mid \neg B) \cdot P(\neg B)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, return to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
