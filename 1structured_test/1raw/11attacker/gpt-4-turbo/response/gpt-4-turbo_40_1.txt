To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us to update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence. In this case, the prior probability and the likelihoods need to be established:

1. **Prior Probability (P(B))**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen person is black = 15% or 0.15

2. **Witness's Accuracy (Likelihoods)**:
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 80% or 0.8
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black = 20% or 0.2

3. **Total Probability that the Witness Identifies the Attacker as Black (P(W_black))**:
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W_{black}) = P(W_{black} | B)P(B) + P(W_{black} | W)P(W)
   \]
   Where:
   - \(P(W_{black} | B)\) = Probability witness identifies a person as black given they are black (0.8)
   - \(P(B)\) = Probability attacker is black (0.15)
   - \(P(W_{black} | W)\) = Probability witness identifies a person as black given they are white (0.2)
   - \(P(W)\) = Probability attacker is white = 85% or 0.85

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(W_{black}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability that Attacker is Black given Witness Identifies as Black (P(B | W_black))**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(B | W_{black}) = \frac{P(W_{black} | B)P(B)}{P(W_{black})}
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(B | W_{black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the witness's accuracy, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer**: {probability: 0.4138}
