To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's identification.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies the race of the person 80% of the time and makes an error in 20% of the cases.
- Therefore, \( P(I_B | B) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black) and \( P(I_B | W) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).
- The population distribution: 85% white (\( P(W) = 0.85 \)) and 15% black (\( P(B) = 0.15 \)).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)}
\]
Where \( P(I_B) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \times P(B) + P(I_B | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can compute \( P(B | I_B) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
