To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B | W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W | B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black, based on the population.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability the witness identifies someone as black.

From the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identified black individuals 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | W) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white; this will be \( 0.2 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).

Now, compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black regardless of actual race:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification under the circumstances described, is approximately 0.4138.
