To resolve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief about the probability distribution of the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem is articulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) (posterior) represents the probability the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(H) \) (prior) is our initial assumption regarding the probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city demographic data.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood) is the probability the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given the attacker was indeed black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E) \) (evidence) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black.

We first calculate \( P(E) \), factoring both the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is wrong:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Result:
{probability: 0.4138}
