To determine the probability that the attacker is black given this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black, and let \( W \) be the event that the attacker observed is white. \( E \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

**Step 1: Determine the prior probabilities.**
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

**Step 2: Calculate the probabilities of the witness identifying someone as black.**
- If the person is black (\( B \)), the witness correctly identified them as black 80% of the time: \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \).
- If the person is white (\( W \)), the witness incorrectly identifies them as black 20% of the time: \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \).

**Step 3: Use Bayes' Theorem.**
Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of identifying the attacker as black, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B) P(B) + P(E|W) P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification under those conditions, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the response in the requested format is:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
