To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this scenario:
- Let \(A\) be the event "the attacker is black".
- Let \(B\) be the event "the witness identified the attacker as black".

We know:
- \(P(A)\), the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is black (given as 15% or 0.15).
- \(P(B|A)\), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is indeed black, which is part of the witness's overall 80% accuracy (hence, the correct identification rate is 0.80).
- \(P(B|A^c)\), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (also related to the error rate of 20%), which corresponds to incorrectly identifying someone as black 20% of the time when they are actually white.

Thus, the complement events follow:
- \(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85\), the probability the attacker is not black.
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \), the probability of the witness wrongly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker were white.

Now, we need to find \(P(B)\), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which combines the true positives with the false positives across all scenarios:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
