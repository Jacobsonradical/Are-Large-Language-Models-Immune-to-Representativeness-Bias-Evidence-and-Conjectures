To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the likelihood of an event (in this case, that the attacker is black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event the attacker is black.
- \( B \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the cityâ€™s demographics), is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., is white), is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B | A) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually not black, is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, the formula is:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substitute these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as such, is roughly 0.4138.

In the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
