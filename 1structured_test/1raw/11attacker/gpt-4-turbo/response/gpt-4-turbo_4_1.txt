To solve this, we can use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs based on the evidence provided. 

1. **Prior probability** (\( P(B) \)) that the attacker is black: 0.15 or 15% (from the population data).

2. **Prior probability** (\( P(W) \)) that the attacker is white: 0.85 or 85%.

3. **Conditional Probability** \( P(R_B|B) \) of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black: 0.8 or 80%.

4. **Conditional Probability** \( P(R_B|W) \) of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually white: 0.2 or 20% (since the witness makes an error in identifying race 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|R_B) = \frac{P(R_B|B) \times P(B)}{P(R_B)} \]
Where,
\[ P(R_B) = P(R_B|B) \times P(B) + P(R_B|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(R_B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|R_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified them as such, is about \(0.4138\) or 41.38%.

{\( probability: 0.4138 \)}
