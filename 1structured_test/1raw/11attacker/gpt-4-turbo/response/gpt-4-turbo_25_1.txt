To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence: 

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (without considering the witness's information).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information:
1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
2. \( P(W) \) needs to be calculated considering the accuracy of the witness.

From the witness's reliability:
- When the attacker is black: Correct 80% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \).
- When the attacker is white: Incorrect identification as black 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \), where \( W \) is white, and here it denotes being incorrectly identified as black.

\( P(W) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) P(B) + P(W|W) P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(B|W) \):
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and known reliability:
- {probability: 0.41}
