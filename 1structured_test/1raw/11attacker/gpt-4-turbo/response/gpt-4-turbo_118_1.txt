To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics, let's use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (i.e., the proportion of the black population in the city).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

1. **Determine \( P(B) \)**:
   From the population statistics:
   \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black)
   \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white)

2. **Determine \( P(W|B) \)**:
   From the witness's accuracy:
   The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time:
   \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \)

3. **Determine \( P(W|W) \)**:
   The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time:
   \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \)

4. **Calculate \( P(W) \)** using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
   \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is about 0.4138.
