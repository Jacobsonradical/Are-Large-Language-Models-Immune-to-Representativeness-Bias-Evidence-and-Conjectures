To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

### Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the person is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that any given person in the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

### Given Data
- The attacker is either white or black (we have no information of other races in the city makeup).
- Population: 85% white and 15% black, so \( P(B) = 0.15 \) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \).
- Witness's accuracy: 80% correct and 20% error for both races:
  - \( P(W|B) \) = 80% or 0.8 (probability witness says black when attacker is black).
  - \( P(W|W) \) = 20% or 0.2 (probability witness says black when attacker is white).

### Calculating \( P(W) \)
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

### Calculating \( P(B|W) \)
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = 0.4138 \]

### Conclusion
The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the final result is:
{ "probability": 0.41 }
