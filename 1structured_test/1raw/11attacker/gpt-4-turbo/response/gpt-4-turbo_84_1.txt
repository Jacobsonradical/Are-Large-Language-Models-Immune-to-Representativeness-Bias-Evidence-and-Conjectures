To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes’ Theorem helps us update our prior belief about a probability (in this case, the demographic distribution of race in the city) based on new evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker's race).

Let:
- **B** be the event that the attacker is black.
- **W** be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem:
1. Prior probability \( P(B) \) that the attacker is black (based on city demographics) = 15% = 0.15.
2. Prior probability \( P(B^c) \) = 85% = 0.85 (probability the attacker is not black).
3. The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as black \( P(W | B) \) = 80% = 0.80.
4. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as not black as black \( P(W | B^c) \) = 20% = 0.20, since 80% of the time they are right about a person's race when they are not black, and the remaining 20% they are mistaken.

Bayes’ Theorem is stated as:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}. \]

To compute \( P(W) \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of whether the attacker is actually black or not), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | B^c) \times P(B^c). \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. \]

Now, substituting into Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138. \]

Thus, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black is about 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
