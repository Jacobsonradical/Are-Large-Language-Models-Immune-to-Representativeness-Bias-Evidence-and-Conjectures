To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identifies them as such.
- \( P(W | B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies black people as black 80% of the time)
  
The witness errs in 20% of the cases, thus misidentifying white as black:
- \( P(W | W) = 0.2 \) (where \( W \) is the probability the attacker is white)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Then, the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (regardless of actual race) is:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black can be computed as:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, given the information that the witness identified the attacker as black and accounting for the witness's accuracy and demographic data:
\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
