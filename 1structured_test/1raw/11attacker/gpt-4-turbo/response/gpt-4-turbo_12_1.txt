To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the above information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem in this scenario is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given data:
- \( P(B) \) (probability the attacker is black) = 0.15 (as 15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) = 0.80 (as the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|W) \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black) = 0.20 (as the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).
- \( P(W) \) (total probability the witness identifies someone as black) = \( P(W|B) P(B) + P(W|W) P(W) \), where \( P(W) \) is the probability a randomly chosen person is white = 0.85.

Plugging these into the formula for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the required estimation in the prescribed format is:
{probability: 0.414}
