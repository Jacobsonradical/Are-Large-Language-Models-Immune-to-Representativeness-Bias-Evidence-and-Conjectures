To answer this, we can utilize Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's denote the probability that the attacker being black as \(P(B)\) and the probability that the attacker is white as \(P(W)\).

We know:
- The prior probabilities (the population distribution): \(P(B) = 0.15\) and \(P(W) = 0.85\).    
- The reliability of the witness: When the person is actually black, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time. This is \(P(\text{Identify Black | Black}) = 0.8\). When the person is white, the witness incorrectly identifies the person as black 20% of the time. This is \(P(\text{Identify Black | White}) = 0.2\).

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black, which can be expressed as \(P(B | \text{Identify Black})\).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B | \text{Identify Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identify Black | B}) \times P(B)}{P(\text{Identify Black})}
\]

Where:
\[
P(\text{Identify Black}) = P(\text{Identify Black | B}) \times P(B) + P(\text{Identify Black | W}) \times P(W)
\]

Substituting the values we have:
\[
P(\text{Identify Black}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \(P(B | \text{Identify Black})\):
\[
P(B | \text{Identify Black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
