To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, letâ€™s apply Bayes' Theorem, which is represented as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black (i.e., the proportion of black people in the city).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W') \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are white.
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (because 85% of the population is white)

From the witness's error rate:
- \( P(W|W') = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Next let's calculate \( P(W) \), which is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is black:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W') \times P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as such, based on the provided information and assuming the independence of witness identification based on race, is approximately 0.41.
