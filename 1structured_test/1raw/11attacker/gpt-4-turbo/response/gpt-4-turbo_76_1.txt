To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the two pieces of information provided, we should apply Bayes’ theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.

From the given text:

- The prior probability \( P(B) \) (the probability that the attacker is black without any other information) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The prior probability \( P(W) \) (the probability that the attacker is white without any other information) is 85%, or 0.85.
- The accuracy of the witness when it comes to identifying if someone is black or white under similar conditions as during the attack night is 80%, or 0.8. Thus:
  - \( P(\text{witness says black} \mid B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that they are black)
  - \( P(\text{witness says black} \mid W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that they are white)

We want to find \( P(B \mid \text{witness says black}) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness said they are black. We use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[
P(B \mid \text{witness says black}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says black} \mid B)P(B)}{P(\text{witness says black})}
\]

where \( P(\text{witness says black}) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{witness says black}) = P(\text{witness says black} \mid B)P(B) + P(\text{witness says black} \mid W)P(W)
\]

Substituting the actual values:

\[
P(\text{witness says black}) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, Bayes’ theorem gives us:

\[
P(B \mid \text{witness says black}) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
