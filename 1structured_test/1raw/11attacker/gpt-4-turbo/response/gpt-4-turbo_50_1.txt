To solve this problem, we can use Bayes’ Theorem, which helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence. Here is the layout using Bayes' Theorem, \( P(B|W) \) (where B is the event the attacker is black, and W is the witness saying the attacker is black):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

1. **P(B)**: Prior probability that the attacker is black.
   - Given as 15%, or 0.15.

2. **P(W|B)**: Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are actually black.
   - Witness can correctly identify race 80% of the time. Hence, \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \).

3. **P(W|¬B)**: Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that they are actually not black (white, in this case).
   - Witness errors in identifying race 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W|¬B) = 0.20 \).

4. **P(¬B)**: Prior probability that the attacker is not black.
   - Given as 85%, or 0.85.

5. **P(W)**: Total probability of witness saying the attacker is black.
   - This can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|¬B) \times P(¬B) \]
   \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
