To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is identified as black by the witness.

We know:
- \( P(B) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is black) = 15% = 0.15
- \( P(W) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is white) = 85% = 0.85
- The witness correctly identifies the race of a person 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
  - \( P(A | B) \) (probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are indeed black) = 0.8
  - \( P(A | W) \) (probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually white) = 0.2

We want to find \( P(B | A) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the attacker was identified as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \times P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Now calculating \( P(A) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black):
\[
P(A) = P(A | B) \times P(B) + P(A | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B | A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
