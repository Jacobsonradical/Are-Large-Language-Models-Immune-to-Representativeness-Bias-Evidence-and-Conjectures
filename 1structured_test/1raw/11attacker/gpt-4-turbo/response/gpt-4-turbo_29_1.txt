To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is black (i.e., 15%, or 0.15).
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Step 1: Calculate \(P(W|B)\),
Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (whether black or white), in cases when the attacker is black:
\[
P(W|B) = 0.8
\]

Step 2: We also need \(P(W|W)\), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as black when in fact the attacker is white:
\[
P(W|W) = 0.2
\]

Step 3: Calculate \(P(W)\), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (whether the attacker is actually black or white):
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W)
\]
Substituting the numbers:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Step 4: Apply Bayes theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
