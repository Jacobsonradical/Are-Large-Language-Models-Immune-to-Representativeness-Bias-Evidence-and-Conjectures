To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the testimony of a witness who can accurately identify race 80% of the time in similar conditions, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is black. From the given demographic data, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
3. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).
4. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \).

We can now apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4138. In the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
