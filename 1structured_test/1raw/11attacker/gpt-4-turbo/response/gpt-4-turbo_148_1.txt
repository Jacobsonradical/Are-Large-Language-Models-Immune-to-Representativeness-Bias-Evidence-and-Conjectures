To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

The theorem can be written as:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a white person as white)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is black in this city)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is white in this city)

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (either correctly identifying a black person or incorrectly identifying a white person) can be calculated by:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W_{error}) \times P(W) \]
where:
- \( P(W|W_{error}) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
