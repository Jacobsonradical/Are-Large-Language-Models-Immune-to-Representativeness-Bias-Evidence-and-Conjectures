To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event, \( P(B) \), based on new evidence, \( E \). In this case, our prior belief is about the probability that the attacker is black, and our new evidence is the testimony of the witness who identified the attacker as black.

1. **Prior probability (\( P(B) \))**: Probability that the attacker is black.
   \[
   P(B) = 0.15 \quad (\text{15% of the population is black})
   \]

2. **Probability the attacker is white (\( P(W) \))**:
   \[
   P(W) = 0.85 \quad (\text{85% of the population is white})
   \]

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Probability that witness correctly identifies a black person as black (\( P(E|B) \))**:
     \[
     P(E|B) = 0.80
     \]
   - **Probability that witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (\( P(E|W) \))**:
     \[
     P(E|W) = 0.20
     \]

4. **Probability of evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) (\( P(E) \))**:
   Using the law of total probability, we consider both scenarios where the attacker can indeed be black or white:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|B) P(B) + P(E|W) P(W)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Posterior probability (\( P(B|E) \))**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem, we update our belief based on the witness's identification:
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) P(B)}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

So, our answer in the required format is:
```json
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
