To answer this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem which can help us update our prior belief about the probabilities based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). Let's define two events:

B = Attacker is black
W = Attacker is white

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We also know about the witness’s ability and accuracy:
- The witness is right 80% of the time, thus:
  P(Identifies B | B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the person as black when they are indeed black),
  P(Identifies W | W) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the person as white when they are indeed white).

- The witness is wrong 20% of the time, which results in:
  P(Identifies B | W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies the person as black when they are actually white),
  P(Identifies W | B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies the person as white when they are actually black).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(B | identifies B) = (P(Identifies B | B) * P(B)) / P(Identifies B)

First, we find P(Identifies B):
P(Identifies B) = P(Identifies B | B) * P(B) + P(Identifies B | W) * P(W)
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                 = 0.12 + 0.17
                 = 0.29

Now, substitute back the values to find P(B | Identifies B):
P(B | Identifies B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
                   ≈ 0.4138

Therefore:
{probability: 0.4138}
