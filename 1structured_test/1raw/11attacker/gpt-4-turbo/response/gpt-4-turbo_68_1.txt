To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given this information, we can apply Bayesian reasoning. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( A \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black (prior probability, \( P(B) \)): 0.15.
- The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white (prior probability, \( P(W) \)): 0.85.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, \( P(A|B) \): 0.80.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, \( P(A|W) \): 0.20.

We want to find \( P(B|A) \) - the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We use Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Where \( P(A) \) - the overall probability of identifying the attacker as black - can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W)
\]
\[
P(A) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(B|A) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).

Therefore, the answer is:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
