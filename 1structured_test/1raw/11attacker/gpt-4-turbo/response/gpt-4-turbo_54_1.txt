To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is written as:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(A) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

The witness's accuracy rate is 80%, therefore:
- \( P(A|B) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black).
- \( P(A|W) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white) because the witness makes an error in 20% of cases.

Using the law of total probability, \( P(A) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.41.
