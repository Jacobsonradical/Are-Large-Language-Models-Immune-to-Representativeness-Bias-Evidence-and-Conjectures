To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the demographic information of the city, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability based on new evidence:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(B | W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \(P(W | B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the population distribution).
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the problem:
- \(P(W | B) = 0.8\) (The probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as black)
- \(P(W | W) = 0.2\) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as white when they are black)
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (Based on city demographics, 15% of the population is black)
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white)

To find \(P(W)\), the law of total probability says:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
