To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( B \): Attacker is black.
- \( W \): Attacker is white.
- \( A \): Witness asserts the attacker is black.

Given:
1. Prior probability based on population distribution:
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% black population)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% white population)
   
2. Witness's accuracy:
   - When the attacker is black, the probability witness asserts black \( P(A|B) \) is 80% (correctly identifies race).
   - When the attacker is white, the probability witness wrongly asserts black \( P(A|W) \) is 20% (witness error rate).

We need to find \( P(B|A) \), the probability the attacker is black given the witness asserts black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where \( P(A) \), the probability of the witness asserting the attacker is black, can be calculated as:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's assertion is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.414}
