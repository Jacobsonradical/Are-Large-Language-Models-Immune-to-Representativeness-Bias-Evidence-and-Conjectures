To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's how we'll apply it:

1. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
   - Let \( T \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Given probabilities**:
   - Probability that a random person is black (\( P(B) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
   - Probability that a random person is white (\( P(W) \)) is 85%, or 0.85.
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (\( P(T | B) \)) is 80%, or 0.8.
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (\( P(T | W) \)) is 20%, or 0.2.

3. **Applying Bayes' theorem**:
   The theorem states:
   \[
   P(B | T) = \frac{P(T | B) \times P(B)}{P(T)}
   \]
   where \( P(T) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black. Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(T) = P(T | B) \times P(B) + P(T | W) \times P(W)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(T) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Calculate posterior probability**:
   \[
   P(B | T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, given the witness identified the attacker as black, the estimated probability that the attacker actually is black is about 0.4138.

Final answer:
```json
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
