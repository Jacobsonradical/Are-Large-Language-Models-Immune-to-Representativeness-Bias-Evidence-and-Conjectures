To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white).
- The witness's ability to correctly identify the race (accuracy) is 80%, and to misidentify the race (error) is 20%.

Since the attacker is either black or white,
- \( P(I|B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black).
- \( P(I|W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).

We use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \times P(B)}{P(I)} \]

Where:
\[ P(I) = P(I|B) \times P(B) + P(I|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, \( P(B|I) \) becomes:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}

This demonstrates the power of Bayesian reasoning in updating prior probabilities in light of new evidence, taking into account the reliability of that evidence.
