To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is represented by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness correctly identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (i.e., the proportion of the black population in the city).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is black.

Given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the witness's accuracy in identifying a black person as black).
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (the chance the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, since the witness has an 80% total accuracy, and 20% of error).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white).

Now we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is black. This is given by the total probability formula:

\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, using Bayes' Theorem, we compute:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.41}
