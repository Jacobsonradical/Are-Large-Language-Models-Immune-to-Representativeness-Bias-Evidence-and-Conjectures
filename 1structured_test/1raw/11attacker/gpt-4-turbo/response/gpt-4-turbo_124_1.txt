To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is black (P(Black)) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W_black). This can be formalized using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{W\_black}) = \frac{P(\text{W\_black} | \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{W\_black})} \]

From the information provided:
- The prior probability that the attacker is black, \( P(\text{Black}) \), is 15% or 0.15.
- The probability that the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black, \( P(\text{W\_black} | \text{Black}) \), is 80% or 0.8. 

Now, we need to find \( P(\text{W\_black}) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be derived from:

\[ P(\text{W\_black}) = P(\text{W\_black} | \text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{W\_black} | \text{White}) \times P(\text{White}) \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{White}) \), the probability that the attacker is white, is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(\text{W\_black} | \text{White}) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, is 20% or 0.20 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time overall and presumably maintains this error rate for both races).

Calculating \( P(\text{W\_black}) \):

\[ P(\text{W\_black}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Black} | \text{W\_black}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Converted to a number between 0 and 1, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him/her as such is approximately 0.41.

Answer:
{probability: 0.41}
