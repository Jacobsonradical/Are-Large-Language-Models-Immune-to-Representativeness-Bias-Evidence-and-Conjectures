To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events:

- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Based on the information provided:
1. \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
2. \( P(B^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white, where \( B^c \) means the attacker is not black, i.e., the attacker is white).
3. The witness's ability to correctly identify someone as black or not is 80%. This includes recognizing a black person as black or a white person as white.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probabilities are:
- \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(W | B^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) (Probability witness identifies the attacker as black) can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | B^c) \cdot P(B^c) \]

Given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus,
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.

Response: {probability: 0.414}
