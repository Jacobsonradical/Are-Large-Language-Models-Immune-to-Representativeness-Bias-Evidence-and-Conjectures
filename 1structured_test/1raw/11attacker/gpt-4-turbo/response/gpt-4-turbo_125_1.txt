To solve this, we can use Bayes' Rule, which in its common form states:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (what we want to determine).
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is identified as black given that they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any given person is black (15% or 0.15 in this case).
- \( P(A) \) is the total probability of identifying the attacker as black.

From the given information:
- \( P(A|B) \) (probability of correctly identifying as black if the attacker is black): This is part of the accuracy of the witness identified as 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A|W) \) (probability of incorrectly identifying as black if the attacker is white): From the error rate, if the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(A|W) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(W) \) (prior probability that any given person is white): 85% or 0.85.

Now, calculate \( P(A) \) (total probability the witness identifies attacker as black):
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(B|A) \):
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witnessâ€™s identification, is approximately 0.4138.
