To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events as follows:
- \(B\) = Attacker is black
- \(W\) = Attacker is white
- \(I\) = Witness identifies the attacker as black

First, we're given the following probabilities from the city demographic:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black)
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white)

From the witness testimony information, we are given:
- When identifying a black person as black, the witness is correct (`True Positive`): \(P(I | B) = 0.8\)
- When identifying a black person as white (`False Negative`): \(P(\neg I | B) = 0.2\)
- When identifying a white person as black (`False Positive`): \(P(I | W) = 0.2\)
- When identifying a white person as white, the witness is correct (`True Negative`): \(P(\neg I | W) = 0.8\)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black, \(P(B | I)\). Bayes' Theorem tells us:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
\]

where \(P(I)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. Using the Law of Total Probability, we get:

\[
P(I) = P(I | B) \times P(B) + P(I | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(I) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Rounding off, we can express the result as:

{
  "probability": 0.414
}

This suggests that, according to the conditions described and the witness's testimony, there is approximately a 41.4% chance that the attacker is black.
