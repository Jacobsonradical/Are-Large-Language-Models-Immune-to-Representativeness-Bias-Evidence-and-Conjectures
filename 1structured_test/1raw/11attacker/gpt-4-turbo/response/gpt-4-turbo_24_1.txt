To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the provided information, we can utilize Bayesian reasoning. Let's define:

- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I_B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B | I_B) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem:
- The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time (\( P(I_B | B) = 0.8 \) and \( P(I_W | W) = 0.8 \) where \( I_W \) is the witness identifying the attacker as white).
- The witness makes an error 20% of the time (\( P(I_B | W) = 0.2 \) and \( P(I_W | B) = 0.2 \)).
- The population proportions are \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% black) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% white).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) P(B)}{P(I_B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(I_B) \) is the total probability the witness identifies someone as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
\[
P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) P(B) + P(I_B | W) P(W)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 * 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
