To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, we use Bayes' Theorem.

- Let \( B \) represent the event the attacker is black, and \( W \) represent the event the attacker is white.
- Let \( E \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Based on the prompt:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black),
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white),
- \( P(E \mid B) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is indeed black),
- \( P(E \mid W) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate \( P(B \mid E) \) (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black):

\[
P(B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, \( P(E) \) (the probability of the event where the attacker is identified as black) is computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E \mid B) \times P(B) + P(E \mid W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
