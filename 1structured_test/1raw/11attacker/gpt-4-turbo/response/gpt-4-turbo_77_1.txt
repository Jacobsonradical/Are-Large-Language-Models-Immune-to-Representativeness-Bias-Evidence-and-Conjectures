To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. 

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black,
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to calculate \( P(B | W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we note:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black, based on population demographics),
- \( P(\text{not } B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is not black).

The witness's reliability, given in the problem, is 80% correct identification (whether the person is black or white under test conditions). Let's assume the witness is equally reliable about black and white identifications. Then:
- \( P(W | B) = 0.80 \) (probability witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is black),
- \( P(W | \text{not } B) = 0.20 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is not black).

We apply Bayes' theorem now, which states:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness will identify the attacker as black (whether the attacker objectively is or not), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B)P(B) + P(W | \text{not } B)P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug this back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
