To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement, we apply Bayes' theorem. We use the information that the witness can correctly identify race 80% of the time (True Positive - TP and True Negative - TN) and incorrectly 20% of the time (False Positive - FP and False Negative - FN), along with the demographic distribution of the city (85% white, 15% black).

We want to calculate \( P(\text{Black}|\text{Witness}) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. Prior Probabilities:
   - \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
   - \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

2. Likelihood:
   - The probability that the witness identifies someone as black given they are black (True Positive, TP): \( P(\text{Witness}|\text{Black}) = 0.8 \)
   - The probability that the witness identifies someone as black given they are white (False Positive, FP): \( P(\text{Witness}|\text{White}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Black}|\text{Witness}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness}|\text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Witness})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Witness}) = P(\text{Witness}|\text{Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Witness}|\text{White}) \times P(\text{White}) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Black}|\text{Witness}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

In probability notation without rounding:
{probability: 0.4138}
