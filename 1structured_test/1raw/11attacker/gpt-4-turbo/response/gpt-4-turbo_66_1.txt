To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the two pieces of information, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be represented as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the person as black given they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that a random person from the city is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability the witness identifies the person as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

Now to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
