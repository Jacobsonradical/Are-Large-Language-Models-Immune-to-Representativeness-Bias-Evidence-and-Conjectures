To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior belief about a situation based on new evidence. 

Let's define the events:
- \( B \) = attacker is black
- \( W \) = attacker is white (complement of \( B \))
- \( R \) = witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city is white)
- \( P(R|B) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
  
Additionally, we can estimate \( P(R|W) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, as the error rate:
- \( P(R|W) = 0.2 \) (The witness makes a mistake 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(B|R) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|R) = \frac{P(R|B) P(B)}{P(R)} \]

where \( P(R) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black. 

Using the law of total probability, \( P(R) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(R) = P(R|B)P(B) + P(R|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(R) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(R) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(B|R) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|R) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as such under the given conditions, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, your requested answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
