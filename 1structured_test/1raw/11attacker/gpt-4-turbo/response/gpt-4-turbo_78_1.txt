To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let's use \( B \) to denote the event that the attacker is black and \( W \) to denote the event that the attacker is white. Let's denote \( D \) the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given:
- \( P(B) \), the probability that a randomly selected person is black, as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \), the probability that a person is white, as 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(D|B) \), the probability the witness identifies the person as black given the person is actually black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(D|W) \), the probability the witness identifies the person as black given the person is actually white, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find \( P(B|D) \), the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]
Here \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. Using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|B) P(B) + P(D|W) P(W) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug it into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
