To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification of the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior belief (based on the overall population statistics) in light of new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) P(B)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness says they are black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that any person (including the attacker) is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black.

From the provided information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identified black people 80% of the time).

We also need to consider \( P(W|W) \), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Given the witness's overall accuracy and error rates as not specifically race-dependent, we can assume \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies white as black 20% of the time).

Now, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) P(B) + P(W|W) P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging everything back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
