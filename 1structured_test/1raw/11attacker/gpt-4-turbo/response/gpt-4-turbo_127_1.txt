To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

The key pieces of information available are:
1. The base rates (prior probabilities) of being black or white in the population:
   - Probability of being white (P(W)) = 0.85
   - Probability of being black (P(B)) = 0.15
2. The witness's accuracy:
   - Probability of correctly identifying a black person as black (P(Identified as Black | Black)) = 0.80
   - Probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black (P(Identified as Black | White)) = 0.20 

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Black} | B) \times P(B)}{P(\text{Identified as Black})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Identified as Black}) \) is the total probability of someone being identified as black. This can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
  \[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = P(\text{Identified as Black} | B) \times P(B) + P(\text{Identified as Black} | W) \times P(W) \]
  \[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
  \[ P(\text{Identified as Black}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging in the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(B | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identified as Black}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | \text{Identified as Black}) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41.
