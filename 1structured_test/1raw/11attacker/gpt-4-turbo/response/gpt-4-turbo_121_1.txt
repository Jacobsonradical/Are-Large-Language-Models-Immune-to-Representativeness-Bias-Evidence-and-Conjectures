To solve this problem, we will utilize Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the cityâ€™s demographic).
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black regardless of the actual race.

From the data provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

The witness's accuracy rate:
- Accurately identifying black individuals: \( P(A|B) = 0.80 \)
- Accurately identifying white individuals (incorrectly calling them black): \( P(A|W) = 0.20 \)

The total probability the witness identifies someone as black (by summing the probabilities of correctly identifying black and incorrectly identifying whites as black), \( P(A) \), can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) + P(A|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|A) \):
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:
{"probability": 0.4138}
