To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events as follows:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black (based on population).
- \( P(A) \) is the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is black) and \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is white).
  
The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, hence:
- \( P(A|B) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(A|W) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using the Law of Total Probability, we calculate \( P(A) \) (probability witness identifies someone as black):
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
