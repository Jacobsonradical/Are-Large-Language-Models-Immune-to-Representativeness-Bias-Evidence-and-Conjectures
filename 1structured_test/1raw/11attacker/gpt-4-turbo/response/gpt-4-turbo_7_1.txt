To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any given person (and thus the attacker) is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, \( P(W|B) \), is 80% or 0.8. This is given by the witness's accuracy.

The probability that the witness wrongly identifies the attacker as black, \( P(W|\bar{B}) \), is the error rate when the attacker is actually white, which is also 20% or 0.2, given that the witnessâ€™s error rate in identifying race is 20%.

The prior probability that any given person (and thus the attacker) is white, \( P(\bar{B}) \), is 85% or 0.85.

Using the Law of Total Probability, we can calculate \( P(W) \) as follows:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|\bar{B}) \cdot P(\bar{B}) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately:
