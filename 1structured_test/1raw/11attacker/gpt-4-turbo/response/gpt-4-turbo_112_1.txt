To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony):

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness says the attacker is black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is black.

From the problem:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies a black person).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (probability witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).
- \( P(W) \), the probability the witness says the attacker is black, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]

Calculating:
- \( P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \)

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
