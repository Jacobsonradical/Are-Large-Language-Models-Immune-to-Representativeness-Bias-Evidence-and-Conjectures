To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W | B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W \mid B) = 0.8 \) (the witness identifies a black person correctly as black 80% of the time).

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \). To do this, consider both scenarios â€” attacker being black or white:

1) \( P(W \mid B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness identifies as black given the attacker is black).
2) \( P(W \mid W') \) where \( W' \) indicates the attacker is white: the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black in 20% of the cases, so \( P(W \mid W') = 0.2 \).
- \( P(W') = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is white based on population data).

Using the law of total probability for \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid B) \times P(B) + P(W \mid W') \times P(W') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Back to Bayes' theorem now to find \( P(B \mid W) \):

\[ P(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification under those conditions is approximately 0.414. Formatted answer:
