To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, let's use Bayes' theorem. We will denote the events as follows:

- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- Let \( I_B \) be the event that the attacker is identified as black.

The prior probabilities, based on the population demographics, are:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

The witness's ability to correctly identify the race (whether the attacker is actually black or white) is 80%. This gives us the conditional probabilities:
- \( P(I_B \mid B) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(I_B \mid W) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black; given as the error rate)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{P(I_B \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

To find \( P(I_B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B \mid B) \times P(B) + P(I_B \mid W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

We then compute \( P(B \mid I_B) \):
\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is approximately **0.4138**.
