To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we will apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \(P(B) = 0.15\) as the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is black (prior probability of being black).
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) as the probability that a person is white (prior probability of being white).
- \(P(T|B) = 0.8\) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- \(P(T|W) = 0.2\) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black.

We seek \(P(B|T)\), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[
P(B|T) = \frac{P(T|B) \times P(B)}{P(T)}
\]
where \(P(T)\) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be computed by law of total probability:

\[
P(T) = P(T|B) \times P(B) + P(T|W) \times P(W)
\]
Substituting the known values:

\[
P(T) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back to find \(P(B|T)\):

\[
P(B|T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is about:

{probability: 0.4138}
