To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the event of the attacker being black,
- \( W \) as the event of the attacker being white,
- \( E \) as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(B) \), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W) \), the prior probability that the attacker is white, is 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
- The accuracy of the witness, that is, \( P(E \mid B) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, is 0.8.
- The error rate of the witness, \( P(E \mid W) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, is 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid B) P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability theorem is used:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid B)P(B) + P(E \mid W)P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, our answer would be:
{probability: 0.414}
