To estimate the probability that the attacker is black using the information given, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here is how it works:

1. **Define the probabilities**:
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
   - Let \( I \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Prior probabilities** (from the population demographics):
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

3. **Probability of witness identification**:
   - \( P(I|B) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
   - \( P(I|W) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
   \]
   
   We need to first find \( P(I) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[
   P(I) = P(I|B) \times P(B) + P(I|W) \times P(W)
        = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29
   \]

5. **Compute the posterior probability**:
   \[
   P(B|I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Based on this calculation, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
