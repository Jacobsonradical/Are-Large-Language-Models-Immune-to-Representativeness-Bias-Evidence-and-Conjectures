To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event the attacker is white.
- \( E \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem statement:
- The prior probability that the attacker is black (\( P(B) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The prior probability that the attacker is white (\( P(W) \)) is 85%, or 0.85.
- The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the relevant probabilities are:
- \( P(E | B) \) = Probability the witness says the attacker is black given the attacker is black = 80% = 0.8.
- \( P(E | W) \) = Probability the witness says the attacker is black given the attacker is white = 20% = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(B | E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \times P(B)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | B) \times P(B) + P(E | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore:

  "probability": 0.4138
