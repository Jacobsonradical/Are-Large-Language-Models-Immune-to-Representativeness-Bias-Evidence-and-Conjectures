To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which is useful for updating probability estimates given new evidence. 

Let:
- \( B \) be the event the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event the attacker is white.
- \( I \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the problem, we have:
- The prior probability that the attacker is black \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the city is black).
- The prior probability that the attacker is white \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the city is white).

From the information about the witness:
- The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases.

Therefore, the likelihoods are:
- \( P(I | B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black).
- \( P(I | W) = 0.2 \) (probability witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
\]

where 

\[
P(I) = P(I | B) \times P(B) + P(I | W) \times P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
