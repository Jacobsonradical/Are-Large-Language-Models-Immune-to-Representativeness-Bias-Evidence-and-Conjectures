To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Here:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified as black.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (i.e., they belong to the black population).
- \( P(A) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From your data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% black population)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% white population)
- \( P(A|B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies black)
- \( P(A|W) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies white as black; error)

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, \( P(A) \), can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.29 \]

Now inserting these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
