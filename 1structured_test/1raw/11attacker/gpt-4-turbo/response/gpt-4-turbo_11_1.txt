To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the data:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \) (This is calculated by considering the two cases: (1) the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as black, (2) the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.)

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

The \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) because the witness correctly identifies black individuals as black 80% of the time.

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Round this to a sensible level for probability estimation:
\[ P(B|W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification can be estimated as approx 0.41.
