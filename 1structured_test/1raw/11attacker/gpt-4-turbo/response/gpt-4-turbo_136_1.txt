To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps update our prior belief based on new evidence.

**Information given:**
- The population consists of 85% white and 15% black.
- The witness can correctly identify the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

**Definitions for Bayes' Theorem:**
- Let \(B\) be the event "the attacker is black".
- Let \(W\) be the event "the attacker is white".
- Let \(I_B\) be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as black".

**Prior probabilities:**
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black)
- \(P(W) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white)

**Likelihoods:**
- \(P(I_B | B)\) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is black) = 0.8
- \(P(I_B | W)\) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is white) = 0.2

**Using Bayes' theorem:**
\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)}
\]
where
\[
P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \times P(B) + P(I_B | W) \times P(W)
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
P(I_B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Calculate \(P(B | I_B)\):
\[
P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

**Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.**
