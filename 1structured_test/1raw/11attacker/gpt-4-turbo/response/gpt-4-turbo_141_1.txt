To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the population, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Using the information provided:

- Let B be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
1. \( P(W|B) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (since the witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time).
2. \( P(W|\neg B) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black) = 0.2 (since the error rate is 20%).
3. \( P(B) \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
4. \( P(\neg B) \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is not black) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
where
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|\neg B) \times P(\neg B) \]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
Therefore,
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.
