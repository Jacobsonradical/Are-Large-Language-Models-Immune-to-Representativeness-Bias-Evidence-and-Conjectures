To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the statement describing the witness's testimony that the attacker is black.

From the problem:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
  - \( P(\text{not } B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
  
- The witness's abilities:
  - \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
  - \( P(W | \text{not } B) = 0.2 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We calculate \( P(B | W) \), the probability the attacker is black given the witness says the attacker is black, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | \text{not } B) \cdot P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8) \cdot (0.15) + (0.2) \cdot (0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute these probabilities into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
