To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayesian updating based on the witness's report and the population demographics.

1. **Population Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \)

2. **Witness's Accuracy (Likelihoods):**
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (\(P(\text{Identify Black | Black})\)) = 0.80
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (\(P(\text{Identify Black | White})\)) = 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that the person is black given that the witness identified them as black (\(P(\text{Black | Identify Black})\)):

\[
P(\text{Black | Identify Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identify Black | Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identify Black | Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identify Black | White}) \times P(\text{White})}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(\text{Black | Identify Black}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black and considering the racial demographics of the city is about 0.4138.
