To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Let \( A \) denote the event "the attacker is black" and \( B \) the event "the witness identified the attacker as black."

2. We know:
   - \( P(A) = 15\% = 0.15 \) (prior probability, as 15% of the population is black).
   - \( P(A^c) = 85\% = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is not black but white, as 85% of the population is white).

3. We also know about the witness's accuracy:
   - The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time.
   - Thus, \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black).
   - \( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, i.e., the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black).

4. We use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   where \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. Substituting these into Bayes' theorem gives:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
