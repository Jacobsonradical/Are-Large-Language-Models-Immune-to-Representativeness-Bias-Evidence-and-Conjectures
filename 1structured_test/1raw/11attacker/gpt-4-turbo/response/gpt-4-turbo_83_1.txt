To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in simplified terms states that:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(A|B) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness is correct in identifying black race)
- \( P(A|W) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies white as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (Proportion of black population in the city)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (Proportion of white population in the city)

First, we calculate \( P(A) \), which includes both correct and incorrect identifications:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B|A) \):
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
