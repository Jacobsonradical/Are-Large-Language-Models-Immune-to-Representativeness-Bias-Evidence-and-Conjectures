To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the problem:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

We also need:
- \( P(W) = P(W|B) \cdot P(B) + P(W|W) \cdot P(W) \)
  - \( P(W|W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies black while the attacker is actually white.
  - Given that half the time the witness incorrectly identifies race and assuming errors are equally likely regardless of the race of the person (misidentifying as black or white), \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \).
  - \( P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \).
  
Calculation:
- \( P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \).

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
