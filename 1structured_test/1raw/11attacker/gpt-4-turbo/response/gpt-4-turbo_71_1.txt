To estimate the probability that the attacker is black using the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Here, we define the following:

- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the population statistics).
- \( P(W) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(C_B | B) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(C_W | W) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white, which is 20% or 0.2 (since there would be a 20% error rate in identifying correctly).

According to Bayes' Theorem, the revised probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, \( P(B | C_B) \), is calculated as follows:

\[
P(B | C_B) = \frac{P(C_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(C_B)}
\]

where \( P(C_B) \) (the probability of the witness claiming the attacker is black) is given by:

\[
P(C_B) = P(C_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(C_B | W) \cdot P(W)
\]
\[
P(C_B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, plug these into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | C_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41.

We can express the final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.41}
