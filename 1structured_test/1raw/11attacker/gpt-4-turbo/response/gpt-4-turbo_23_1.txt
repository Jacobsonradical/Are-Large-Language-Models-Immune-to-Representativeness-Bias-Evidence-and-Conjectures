To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayesian probability.

1. **Prior Probability** (Initial belief before witnessing)
   - Population ratio: 85% white, 15% black
   - \( P(B) \) = probability attacker is black = 0.15
   - \( P(W) \) = probability attacker is white = 0.85

2. **Witness's Ability** (Likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis)
   - Correct identification of race = 80% (this applies both ways, when the person is black or white)
   - Error rate in identification = 20%
   - \( P(Witness \text{ says } Black | Black) \) = 0.8
   - \( P(Witness \text{ says } Black | White) \) = 0.2

3. **Witness's Statement**
   - Let \( W_B \) = Event that witness identifies the attacker as black. We need to find \( P(Black | Witness \text{ says } Black) \).

Using Bayesian formula:
\[ P(Black | Witness \text{ says } Black) = \frac{P(Witness \text{ says } Black | Black) \times P(Black)}{P(Witness \text{ says } Black)} \]

Here, \( P(Witness \text{ says } Black) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which can happen in two ways:
- Correct identification if the person is actually black
- Incorrect identification if the person is actually white

Calculate total probability of witness saying the attacker is black:
\[ P(Witness \text{ says } Black) = P(Witness \text{ says } Black | Black) \times P(Black) + P(Witness \text{ says } Black | White) \times P(White) \]
\[ P(Witness \text{ says } Black) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Black | Witness \text{ says } Black) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.414.
