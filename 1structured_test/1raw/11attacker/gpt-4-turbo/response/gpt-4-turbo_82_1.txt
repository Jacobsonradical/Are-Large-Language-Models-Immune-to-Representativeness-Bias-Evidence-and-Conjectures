To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update our initial belief about the probability of an event (the prior) based on new evidence (the likelihood).

Let's define:
- \(B\) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) as the event that the attacker is white.
- \(I\) as the event where the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
1. \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black).
2. \(P(W) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is white).
3. \(P(I | B)\), the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given they are black = 80% or 0.8.
4. \(P(I | W)\), the probability that the witness identifies the person as black given they are white = 20% or 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).

We need to find \(P(B | I)\), or the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{P(I | B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
\]

where \(P(I)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(I) = P(I | B) \times P(B) + P(I | W) \times P(W)
\]

Calculating this:

\[
P(I) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find:

\[
P(B | I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the demographic information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately \(0.4138\).
  
Thus, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
