To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given this information, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief in light of new evidence. Let's denote:
- \( B \) for the event the attacker is black,
- \( W \) for the event the attacker is white,
- \( I \) for the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find \( P(B \mid I) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- The witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying a person's race correctly under similar conditions, which implies:
  - \( P(I \mid B) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black is 80%)
  - \( P(I \mid W) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white is 20%)

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B \mid I) = \frac{P(I \mid B) \times P(B)}{P(I)}
\]

Where \( P(I) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[
P(I) = P(I \mid B) \times P(B) + P(I \mid W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(I) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substituting into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B \mid I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
