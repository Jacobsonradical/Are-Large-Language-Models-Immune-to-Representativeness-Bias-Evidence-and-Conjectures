To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence to find a posterior probability.

Let:
- \(B\) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \(E\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
1. Prior probability that the attacker is black (\(P(B)\)) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
2. Prior probability that the attacker is white (\(P(W)\)) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
3. The witness correctly identifies black as black (\(P(E | B)\)) = 0.80.
4. The witness incorrectly identifies white as black (\(P(E | W)\)) = 0.20 (since they get it wrong 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (\(P(B | E)\)) is calculated as:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, the probability \(P(E)\) which represents the witness identifying the attacker as black, whether the attacker is black or white, can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E | B)P(B) + P(E | W)P(W)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.414.
