To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( B \) as the event the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event the attacker is white.
- \( E \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to the information provided:

- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

From the witness data:
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
  - Thus, \( P(E | B) = 0.8 \) (if the attacker is black, the probability that the witness identifies him as black is 80%).
  - \( P(E | W) = 0.2 \) (if the attacker is white, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies him as black is 20%).

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{P(E | B) \times P(B)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

\[
P(E) = P(E | B) \times P(B) + P(E | W) \times P(W)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \approx 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(B | E) \):

\[
P(B | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified the individual as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4138}
