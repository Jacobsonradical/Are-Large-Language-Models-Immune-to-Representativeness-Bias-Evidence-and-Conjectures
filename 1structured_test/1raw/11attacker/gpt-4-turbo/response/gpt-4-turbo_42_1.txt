To solve this, we can use Bayesian probability updating. There are two probabilities to take into account:
1. The prior probability of any randomly chosen attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 (as given by the population breakdown in the city).
2. The conditional probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given the true race of the person involved.

Given:
- \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is white)
- Witness's accuracy \( = 0.80 \) 

The witness's probability of correctly identifying or wrongly identifying the race is given by:
- \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black | Attacker is Black}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black | Attacker is White}) = 0.20 \)

From here, apply Bayesian updating to find \( P(\text{Black | Witness identifies as Black}) \). Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{Black | Witness identifies as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness identifies as Black | Black}) \times P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Witness identifies as Black})} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Witness identifies as Black}) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black) can be found using the law of total probability:
  \[
  P(\text{Witness identifies as Black}) = P(\text{Witness identifies as Black | Black}) \times P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Witness identifies as Black | White}) \times P(\text{White})
  \]
  \[
  = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
  \]

Then plugging back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(\text{Black | Witness identifies as Black}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41.

Thus, your answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.41}
