To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- Let \( A \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as black.

The prior probabilities given by the demographic data are:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black),
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the race based on these conditions are:
- The witness identifies the correct race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
  - \( P(A|B) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies a black as black),
  - \( P(A|W) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a white as black).

We are interested in finding \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

The denominator \( P(A) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(A) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) + P(A|W) \cdot P(W)
\]
\[
P(A) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
