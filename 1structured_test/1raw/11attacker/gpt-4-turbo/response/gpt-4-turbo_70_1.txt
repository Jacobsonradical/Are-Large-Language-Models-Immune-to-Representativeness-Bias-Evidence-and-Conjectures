To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context allows us to update our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

**Step 1: Define the probabilities**
- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- Let \( W \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given data, we can identify:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.8 \) (prob. witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black)
- \( P(W | \neg B) = 0.2 \) (prob. witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is not black)

**Step 2: Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem**
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black overall, is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W | B) \times P(B) + P(W | \neg B) \times P(\neg B)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

**Step 3: Calculate \( P(B | W) \)**
\[
P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41 or \(41\%\).
