To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence presented, we apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief about the attacker's race based on the new information provided by the witness.

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race.
- \( \Pr(B) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( \Pr(\neg B) \) be the probability that the attacker is not black.
- \( \Pr(W \mid B) \) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \( \Pr(W \mid \neg B) \) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- 15% of the city's population is black, so \( \Pr(B) = 0.15 \).
- 85% of the city's population is white, so \( \Pr(\neg B) = 0.85 \).
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. Thus, \( \Pr(W \mid B) = 0.8 \) and \( \Pr(W \mid \neg B) = 0.2 \) (because this represents incorrectly identifying the race when the attacker is not black).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ \Pr(B \mid W) = \frac{\Pr(W \mid B) \Pr(B)}{\Pr(W)} \]

First, calculate \( \Pr(W) \) (the probability that the witness claims the attacker is black):
\[ \Pr(W) = \Pr(W \mid B) \Pr(B) + \Pr(W \mid \neg B) \Pr(\neg B) \]
\[ \Pr(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ \Pr(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ \Pr(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ \Pr(B \mid W) = \frac{\Pr(W \mid B) \Pr(B)}{\Pr(W)} \]
\[ \Pr(B \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ \Pr(B \mid W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \Pr(B \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
