To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this case is formulated as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that any given person is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) because the witness identifies black correctly 80% of the time.
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) because 15% of the population is black.

We also need:
- \( P(W|W) \) the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white.
- \( P(W) \) which can be calculated using total probability theorem: \( P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \).

Given:
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) because the witness fails to correctly identify race 20% of the time (thus misidentifying a white person as black).
- \( P(W) = 80\% \times 15\% + 20\% \times 85\% = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification under those conditions is approximately 0.414.

Answer: {"probability": 0.414}
