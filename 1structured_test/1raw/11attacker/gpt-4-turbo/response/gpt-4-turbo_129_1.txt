To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which updates our probability estimate based on new evidence. 

Let:
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
- \( I \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and incorrectly 20% of the time.

We need:
- \( P(I|B) \), the probability the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 
- \( P(I|W) \), the probability the witness says the attacker is black given that the attacker is white = 0.2 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B)P(B)}{P(I)} \]

First compute \( P(I) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(I) = P(I|B)P(B) + P(I|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(I) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B)P(B)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|I) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
