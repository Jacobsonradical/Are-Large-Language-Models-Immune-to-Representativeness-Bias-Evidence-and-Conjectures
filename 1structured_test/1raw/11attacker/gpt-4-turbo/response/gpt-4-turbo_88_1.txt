To estimate the probability that the attacker is black using the given information, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- Probability witness identifies someone as black correctly (given the person is black), \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \).
- Probability of misidentification (witness identifies someone as black given the person is not black), \( P(W|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \).
- Probability based on population that a randomly selected person is black, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- Probability that a randomly selected person is not black, \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.85 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, \( P(A|W) \) (probability the attacker is black given the witness identifies them as black) can be calculated as follows:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|\text{not } A)P(\text{not } A)
\]
Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
