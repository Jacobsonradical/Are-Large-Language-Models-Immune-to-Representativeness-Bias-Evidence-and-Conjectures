To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes’ Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event "attacker is black"
- \( B \) as the event "witness identified the attacker as black"

We will compute \( P(A|B) \), i.e., the probability the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The inputs we have from the problem:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (the witness made an error in identifying the race 20% of the time).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the population statistics, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black (is white in this scenario), which is 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

According to Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, computed using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.
