To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the population distribution).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(W|W) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white)

First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.41.
