To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in updating our initial beliefs based on new evidence. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

Let:
- \(A\) be the event that the attacker is black.
- \(W\) be the witness's testimony that the attacker is black.

From the problem statement, we have:
- The prior probability \(P(A)\) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is black based on the city's racial demographic) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The prior probability \(P(A^c)\) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is white) is 85%, or 0.85.
- The likelihood \(P(W|A)\) (the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually black) given as 80%, or 0.8.
- The probability \(P(W|A^c)\) (the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually white) is the error rate, 20% or 0.2.

Bayes’ theorem states:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]
where 
\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)
\]
calculating \(P(W)\):
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Thus,
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
