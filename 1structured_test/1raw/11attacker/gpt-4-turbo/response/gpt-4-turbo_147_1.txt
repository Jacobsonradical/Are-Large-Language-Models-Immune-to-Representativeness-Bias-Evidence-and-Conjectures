To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the available information, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Let's define the following:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the data provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black whether the attacker is actually black or not. We calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) P(A) + P(W | \neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
