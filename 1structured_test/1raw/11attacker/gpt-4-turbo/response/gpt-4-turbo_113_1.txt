To solve this question, we use Bayes' Theorem, a formula that allows us to update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the initial probability the attacker is black (prior probability, based on population).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black.

Let's calculate these values:
1. **Prior Probability** \( P(B) \):
   - The percentage of the black population in the city is 15%, so \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
   
2. **Witness's Accuracy** \( P(W|B) \) and \( P(W|W) \) :
   - The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is given as 80%, so \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \).
   - Conversely, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is the error rate, which is 20%. Thus, \( P(W|W) = 0.20 \).

3. **Total Probability of Witness Identifying Attacker as Black** \( P(W) \):
   - Using the law of total probability, we have \( P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \)
   - Plugging in the values, \( P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]
