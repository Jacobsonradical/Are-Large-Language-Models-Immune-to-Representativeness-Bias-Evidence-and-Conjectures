To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(W|B) \) is 0.8 (the probability the witness accurately identifies a black person as black).
- \( P(B) \) is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|W) \) is 0.2 (the probability the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).
- \( P(W) \) is 0.65 (85% of the population is white).

Now, calculating \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:
{probability: 0.4138}
