To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which can help update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Here, we have P(B) as the probability the attacker is black before considering the witness's identification, which is 0.15 (15%), and P(W) as the probability the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).

The witness identifies the attacker as black with an accuracy rate of 80% and therefore a 20% error rate. Thus:

- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is P(E|B) = 0.80.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is P(E|W) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black overall, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute values back into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
