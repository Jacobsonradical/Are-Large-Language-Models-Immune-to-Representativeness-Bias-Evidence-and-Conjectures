To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief (in this case, the racial distribution of the population) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define the events:
- B: Attacker is black.
- W: Attacker is white.
- I_B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.
- I_W: The witness identifies the attacker as white.

From the data:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

We also have the witness's accuracy:
- P(I_B | B) = 0.80 (Probability that witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black).
- P(I_B | W) = 0.20 (Probability that witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white).

We want to find P(B | I_B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.
  
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]

We first need to calculate P(I_B), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \cdot P(B) + P(I_B | W) \cdot P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I_B) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to find P(B | I_B):
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witnessâ€™s identification under those specific conditions, is approximately 0.4138.
