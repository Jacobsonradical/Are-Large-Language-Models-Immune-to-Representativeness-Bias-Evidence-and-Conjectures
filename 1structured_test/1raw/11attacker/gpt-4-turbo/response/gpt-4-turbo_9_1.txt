To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (based solely on the demographic information).
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- The population is comprised of 85% white and 15% black. Thus, \(P(B) = 0.15\) and \(P(W) = 0.85\).
- The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, whether the person is white or black. Thus, \(P(W|B) = 0.8\) (probability witness correctly identifies a black person as black) and \(P(W|W) = 0.2\) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, \(P(W)\), can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W)
= 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
= \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
= \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\approx 0.4138
\]

This calculation finds the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the specified format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
