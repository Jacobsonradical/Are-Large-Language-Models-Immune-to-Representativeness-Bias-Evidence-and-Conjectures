To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's represent:
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Based on the information provided:
- \( P(B) \) = the prior probability that the attacker is black = 15% = 0.15.
- \( P(W|B) \) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black = 80% = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals).
- \( P(W|B^c) \) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 20% = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in wrongly identifying non-black individuals as black).
- \( P(B^c) \) = the prior probability that the attacker is not black = 85% = 0.85.

We need to find \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|B^c) \times P(B^c) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the given statistics is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
