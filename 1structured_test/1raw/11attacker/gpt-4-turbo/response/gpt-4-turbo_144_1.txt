To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimates with new evidence. We'll define the following variables:

- B = Event the attacker is black.
- W = Event the attacker is white.
- E = Event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(B) \) = Probability the attacker is black = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- \( P(W) \) = Probability the attacker is white = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- \( P(E|B) \) = Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker IS black. From the problem, the witness correctly identifies any personâ€™s race 80% of the time, so \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|W) \) = Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker IS white. As the witness errs 20% of the time, \( P(E|W) = 0.2 \)

We also need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(B|E) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is about 0.4138.

Therefore, we have:
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
