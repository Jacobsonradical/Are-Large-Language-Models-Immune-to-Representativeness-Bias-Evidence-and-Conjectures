To find the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it can be calculated step-by-step:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is black.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the attacker is white.
   - Let \( I \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Known probabilities:**
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is black)
   - \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is white)
   - When the true person is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as black, \( P(I|B) = 0.8 \).
   - When the true person is white, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies them as black, \( P(I|W) = 0.2 \).

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(B|I) = \frac{P(I|B) \times P(B)}{P(I)} \]
   Here, \( P(I) \) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black) can be calculated using:
   \[ P(I) = P(I|B)P(B) + P(I|W)P(W) \]
   \[ P(I) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Plugging all known values into Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(B|I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.414.
