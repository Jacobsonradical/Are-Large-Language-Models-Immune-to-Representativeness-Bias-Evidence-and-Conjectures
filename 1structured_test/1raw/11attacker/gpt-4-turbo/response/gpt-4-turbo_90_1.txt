To determine the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. It is stated mathematically as:

\[
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(B | A)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such.
- \(P(A | B)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that they are indeed black.
- \(P(B)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (without considering the witness's identification).
- \(P(A)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- 15% of the population is black (\(P(B) = 0.15\)).
- 85% of the population is white (\(P(W) = 0.85\)).
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so \(P(A | B) = 0.80\) (probability witness identifies someone as black when they are black) and \(P(A | W) = 0.20\) (probability witness mistakenly identifies someone as black when they are white).

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, \(P(A)\), can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(A) = P(A | B) \cdot P(B) + P(A | W) \cdot P(W)
\]
\[
P(A) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)}
\]
\[
P(B | A) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
