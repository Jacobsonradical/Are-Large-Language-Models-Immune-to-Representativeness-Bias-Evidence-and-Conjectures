To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief about the probability of an event (here, that the attacker is black) based on new evidence (here, the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event the attacker is black.
- \( W \) as the event the attacker is white.
- \( T \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is white).
- \( P(T | B) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).
- \( P(T | W) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B | T) = \frac{P(T | B) \times P(B)}{P(T)} \]

Where \( P(T) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(T) = P(T | B) \times P(B) + P(T | W) \times P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]

Calculating \( P(T) \):
\[ P(T) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug in the values to find \( P(B | T) \):
\[ P(B | T) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
