To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the described witness testimony and demographic information, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is stated as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B)P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(B|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- \(P(W|B)\) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is black (prior probability).
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Given:
- \(P(B) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is black)
- \(P(W|B) = 0.8\)
- \(P(W| \text{not } B)\) = the probability that the witness wrongly identifies a white as black = 0.2

We should also compute \(P(W)\) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|B)P(B) + P(W|\text{not } B)P(\text{not } B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B)P(B)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, taking into account both the witness testimony and the population statistics, is about 0.4138.
