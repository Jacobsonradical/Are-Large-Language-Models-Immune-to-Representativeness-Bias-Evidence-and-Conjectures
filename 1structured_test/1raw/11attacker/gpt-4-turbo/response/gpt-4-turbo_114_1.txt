To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to revise a prior probability estimate into a posterior probability using new evidence.

Let \( B \) represent the event that the attacker is black. Let \( W \) represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as black given they are actually black is 0.8 (True Positive).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as black given they are actually white is 0.2 (False Positive).

Additionally, we know from the city's demographics:
- The prior probability that a randomly selected assailant is black, \( P(B) \), is 0.15.
- Hence, the prior probability that the assailant is white, \( P(B^c) \) (where \( B^c \) represents the event the attacker is not black), is 0.85.

We need to calculate \( P(B|W) \), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given by:
\[
P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|B^c) \times P(B^c)
\]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using this in Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(B|W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification under these conditions is approximately 0.4138.
