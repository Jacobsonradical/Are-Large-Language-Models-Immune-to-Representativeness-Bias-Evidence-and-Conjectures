To find the probability that the attacker is black given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let:
- B be the event that the attacker is black.
- W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know the following:
- P(B) = the prior probability that the attacker is black = 15% = 0.15.
- P(B^c) = the prior probability that the attacker is white = 85% = 0.85.
- P(W | B) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is really black = 80% = 0.8 (accuracy of witness when the attacker is black).
- P(W | B^c) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is really white = 20% = 0.2 (error rate of the witness when the attacker is white).

Using Bayes' Theorem to compute P(B | W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{P(W | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where,
\[ P(W) = P(W | B) \cdot P(B) + P(W | B^c) \cdot P(B^c) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138 \]

Thus, {probability: 0.4138} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the racial distribution in the city.
