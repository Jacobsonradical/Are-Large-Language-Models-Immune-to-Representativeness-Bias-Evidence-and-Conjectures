To calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence provided, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the event the attacker is black,
- \( W \) as the event the attacker is white,
- \( I_B \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as black,
- \( I_W \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as white.

From the information provided:
1. Prior probability that attacker is black, \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is black).
2. Prior probability that attacker is white, \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is white).
3. The witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time and makes a mistake 20% of the time:
   - \( P(I_B | B) = 0.8 \) (probability that witness identifies as black given the person is black)
   - \( P(I_B | W) = 0.2 \) (probability that witness identifies as black given the person is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{P(I_B | B) \times P(B)}{P(I_B)} \]
where
\[ P(I_B) = P(I_B | B) \times P(B) + P(I_B | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(I_B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, applying these values in Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(B | I_B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.414.
