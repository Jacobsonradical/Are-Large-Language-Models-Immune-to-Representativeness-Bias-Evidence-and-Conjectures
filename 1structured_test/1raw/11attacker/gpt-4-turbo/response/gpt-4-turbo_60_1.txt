To estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|W) \) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
- \( P(W|B) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability the attacker is black, based on the population (without witness information).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability the witness declares the attacker as black.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is black).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.80 \) (witness identifies a black person as black with 80% accuracy).
- \( P(W|W) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white with 80% accuracy, but we need its complement, i.e., the error rate identifying white as black: \( 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \)).
- \( P(W) \) can be obtained using the law of total probability: 
   \[ P(W) = P(W|B) \times P(B) + P(W|W) \times P(W) \]
   \( P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \)
   \( P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Thus, according to the Bayesian analysis with the given assumptions and information, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately:

{probability: 0.41379}
