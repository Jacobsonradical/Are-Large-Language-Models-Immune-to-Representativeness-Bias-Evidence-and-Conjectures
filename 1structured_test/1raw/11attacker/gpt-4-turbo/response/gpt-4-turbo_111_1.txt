To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (a witness identifying the attacker as black).

**Step 1: Set up the known probabilities**
- \( P(\text{Black}) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is black)
- \( P(\text{White}) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is white)
- \( P(\text{Identify as Black} \mid \text{Black}) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- \( P(\text{Identify as Black} \mid \text{White}) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

**Step 2: Use the Law of Total Probability to find \( P(\text{Identify as Black}) \)**
\[ P(\text{Identify as Black}) = P(\text{Identify as Black} \mid \text{Black})P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Identify as Black} \mid \text{White})P(\text{White}) \]
\[ = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

**Step 3: Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem to find \( P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Identify as Black}) \)**
\[ P(\text{Black} \mid \text{Identify as Black}) = \frac{P(\text{Identify as Black} \mid \text{Black})P(\text{Black})}{P(\text{Identify as Black})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
