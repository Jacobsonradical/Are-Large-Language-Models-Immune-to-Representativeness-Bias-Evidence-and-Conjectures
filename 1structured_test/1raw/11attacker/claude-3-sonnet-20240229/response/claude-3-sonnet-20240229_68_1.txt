To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the evidence and the hypothesis.

Given:
- P(witness correct | attacker is black) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | attacker is black) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population)
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white, based on the population)

We want to find P(attacker is black | witness says black).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (P(witness says black | attacker is black) × P(attacker is black)) / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) × P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) × P(attacker is white)
                     = (0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)
                     = 0.12 + 0.17
                     = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:
P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
                                          = 0.12 / 0.29
                                          = 0.4137

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
