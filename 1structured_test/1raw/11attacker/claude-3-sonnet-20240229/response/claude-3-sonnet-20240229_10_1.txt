To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
