To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of cases.
- 15% of the population in the city is black, and 85% is white.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population statistics.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, whether the attacker is actually black or not.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming P(B|~A) = 0.2, the error rate)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
