To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population composition)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the complement of A)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population composition, is:

{probability: 0.414}
