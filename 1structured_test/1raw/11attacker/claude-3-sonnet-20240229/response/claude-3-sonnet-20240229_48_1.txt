To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here's the step-by-step solution:

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).

P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
