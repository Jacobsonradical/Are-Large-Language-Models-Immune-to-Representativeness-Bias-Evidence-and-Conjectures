To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black individuals, which is 0.8 or 80%.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 or 15% (based on the population distribution).

P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A')
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.27

Now, we can plug in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.444}
