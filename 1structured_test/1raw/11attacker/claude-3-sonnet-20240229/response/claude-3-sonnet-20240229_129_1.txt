To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (P(Witness correct | Black) = 0.8).
- The witness makes an erroneous identification 20% of the time (P(Witness incorrect | White) = 0.2).
- The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (based on the population statistics).
- The prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (based on the population statistics).

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (P(Black | Witness identifies black)).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Black | Witness identifies black) = (P(Witness identifies black | Black) × P(Black)) / ((P(Witness identifies black | Black) × P(Black)) + (P(Witness identifies black | White) × P(White)))

Substituting the given values:

P(Black | Witness identifies black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / ((0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85))
P(Black | Witness identifies black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(Black | Witness identifies black) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(Black | Witness identifies black) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
