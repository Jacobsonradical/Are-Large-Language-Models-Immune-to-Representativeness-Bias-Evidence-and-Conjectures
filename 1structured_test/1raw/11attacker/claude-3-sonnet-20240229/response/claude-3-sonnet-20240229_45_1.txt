To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
