To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black (the probability we want to find)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (0.8 from the information provided)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15 from the population data)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black (we need to calculate this)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A^c) × P(A^c)

Where A^c is the event that the attacker is not black (white).

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness accuracy for black individuals)
We also know that P(A) = 0.15 (from the population data)

We can assume that P(B|A^c) = 0.2, since the witness has an error rate of 20% for identifying white individuals as black.
And P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from the population data)

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population data, is:

{probability: 0.414}
