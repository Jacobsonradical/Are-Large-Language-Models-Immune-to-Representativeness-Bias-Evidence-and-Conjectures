To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Given:
- Prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (based on the population distribution)
- Prior probability that the attacker is white = 0.85
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.2

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The attacker is white
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

P(E|B) = 0.8 (Probability of correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (Probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
P(W) = 0.85 (Prior probability that the attacker is white)

Substituting the values:
P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
