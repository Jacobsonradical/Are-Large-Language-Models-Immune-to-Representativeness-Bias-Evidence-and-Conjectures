To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(witness correct | black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | black) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time)
- P(witness correct | white) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(black | witness says black), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(black | witness says black) = (P(witness says black | black) × P(black)) / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black | black) = P(witness correct | black) = 0.8
P(witness says black | white) = P(witness incorrect | white) = 0.2

P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | black) × P(black) + P(witness says black | white) × P(white)
P(witness says black) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.27

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(black | witness says black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.444}
