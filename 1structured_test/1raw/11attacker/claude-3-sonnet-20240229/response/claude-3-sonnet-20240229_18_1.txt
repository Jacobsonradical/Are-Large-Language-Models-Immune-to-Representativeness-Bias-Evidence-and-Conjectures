To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred (the probability we want to find).
- P(B|A) is the probability of observing event B given that event A has occurred.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A occurring.
- P(B) is the probability of observing event B.

In our case:
- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time).
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time).

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of observing event B (the witness identifies the attacker as black), using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4137931}

This means that given the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is approximately 0.4137931 or 41.38%.
