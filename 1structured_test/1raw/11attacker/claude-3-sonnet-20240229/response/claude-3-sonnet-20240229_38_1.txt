To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population composition)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (The witness can either correctly identify a black person or incorrectly identify a white person as black)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population composition, is:

{probability: 0.414}
