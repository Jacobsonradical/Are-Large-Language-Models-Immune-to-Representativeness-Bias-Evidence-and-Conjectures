To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.414}
