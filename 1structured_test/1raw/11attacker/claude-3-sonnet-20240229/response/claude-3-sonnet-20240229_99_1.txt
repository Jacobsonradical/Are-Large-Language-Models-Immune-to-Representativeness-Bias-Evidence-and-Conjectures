To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred (the posterior probability)
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred (the likelihood)
- P(A) is the probability of event A occurring (the prior probability)
- P(B) is the probability of event B occurring

In our case:
- Event A is "the attacker is black"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We need to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
