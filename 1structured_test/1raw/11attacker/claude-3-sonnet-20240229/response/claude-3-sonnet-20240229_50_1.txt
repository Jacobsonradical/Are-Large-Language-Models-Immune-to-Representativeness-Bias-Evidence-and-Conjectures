To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability (based on the population demographics) with the likelihood (based on the witness's testimony and their accuracy in identifying race).

Given information:
- Prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- Prior probability that the attacker is white = 0.85 (85% of the population)
- Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black = 0.8
- Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.2

Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as W.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / (P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and their accuracy, is:

{probability: 0.414}
