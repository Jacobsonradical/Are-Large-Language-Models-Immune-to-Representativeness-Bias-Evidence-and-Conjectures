To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is not black)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

Using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
