To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to calculate the probability of a hypothesis given the observed evidence.

Let's define the events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population statistics.
- P(W) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which we need to calculate.

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|¬B) * 0.85

Here, P(W|¬B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2 (20%).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
