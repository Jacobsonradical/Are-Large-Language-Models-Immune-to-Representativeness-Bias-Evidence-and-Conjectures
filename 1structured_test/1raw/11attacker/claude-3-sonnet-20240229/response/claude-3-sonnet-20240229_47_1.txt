To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
  - P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
  - P(¬A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
  - P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
