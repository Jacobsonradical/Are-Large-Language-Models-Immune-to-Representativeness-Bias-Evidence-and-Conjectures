To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(W) = 0.85: The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white.
- P(B) = 0.15: The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black.
- P(E|B) = 0.8: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (true positive rate).
- P(E|W) = 0.2: The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (false positive rate).

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) × P(B)) / (P(E|B) × P(B) + P(E|W) × P(W))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|E) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
