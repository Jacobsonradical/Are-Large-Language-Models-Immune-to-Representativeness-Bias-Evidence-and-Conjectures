To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the evidence (witness identification) and the prior probabilities of the attacker's race.

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (true positive rate).
- The witness errs in 20% of the cases (false positive rate).
- 15% of the population in the city is black (prior probability of the attacker being black).
- 85% of the population in the city is white (prior probability of the attacker being white).

Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as E.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / P(E)

Where:
- P(E|B) is the true positive rate (0.8)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15)
- P(E) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|¬B) * P(¬B), where P(E|¬B) is the false positive rate (0.2), and P(¬B) is the prior probability of the attacker being white (0.85).

Substituting the values:
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
