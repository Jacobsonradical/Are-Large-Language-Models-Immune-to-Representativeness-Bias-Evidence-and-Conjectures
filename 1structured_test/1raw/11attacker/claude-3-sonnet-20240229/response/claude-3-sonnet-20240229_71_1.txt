To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (provided as 0.8).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (given as 0.15, the proportion of the black population in the city).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
  We don't have the value of P(B|A'), but we can calculate it using the given information: P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
