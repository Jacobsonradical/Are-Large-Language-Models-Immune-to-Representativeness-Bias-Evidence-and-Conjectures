To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black, given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.12 / 0.29
        = 0.4137

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
