To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to calculate the conditional probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
