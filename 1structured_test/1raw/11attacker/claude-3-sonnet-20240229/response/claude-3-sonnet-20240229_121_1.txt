To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming the witness errs 20% of the time for both black and white individuals)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
