To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information provided, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the given population statistics, we have P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which we can calculate using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A), where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not black.

We don't have the value of P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. However, we can use the information that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
