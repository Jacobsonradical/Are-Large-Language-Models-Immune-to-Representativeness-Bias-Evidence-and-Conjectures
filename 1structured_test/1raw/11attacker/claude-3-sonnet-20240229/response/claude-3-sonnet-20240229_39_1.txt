To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black (white)
  - P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
  - P(~A) = 0.85 (the base rate of white people in the population is 85%)
  - P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.414}
