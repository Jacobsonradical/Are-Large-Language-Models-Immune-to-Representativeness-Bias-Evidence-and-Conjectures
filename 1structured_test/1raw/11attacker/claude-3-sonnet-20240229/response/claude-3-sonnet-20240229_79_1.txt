To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. From the information provided, this is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the population statistics, this is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white).
  We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15.
  We also know that P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
  However, we don't know P(B|A'), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. We can calculate it using the information that the witness errs 20% of the time:
  P(B|A') = 0.2

Substituting these values into the law of total probability:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
