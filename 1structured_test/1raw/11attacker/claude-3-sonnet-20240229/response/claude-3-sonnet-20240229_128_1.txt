To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events with their marginal probabilities.

Given:
- P(witness correctly identifies race) = 0.8
- P(witness incorrectly identifies race) = 0.2
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black individuals).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. It can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(not A)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.444}
