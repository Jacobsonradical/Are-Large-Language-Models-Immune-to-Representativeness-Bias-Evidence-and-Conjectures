To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events based on the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (white). This is the error rate of 0.2 (20%).
- P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black (white), which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
