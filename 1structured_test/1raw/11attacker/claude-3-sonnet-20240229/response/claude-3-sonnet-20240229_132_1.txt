To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black 80% of the time)
- P(witness identifies white | attacker is white) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies white 80% of the time)

We want to find P(attacker is black | witness identifies black).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) = (P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) × P(black)) / (P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) × P(black) + P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) × P(white))

Substituting the values:
P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(attacker is black | witness identifies black) = 0.4137931

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
