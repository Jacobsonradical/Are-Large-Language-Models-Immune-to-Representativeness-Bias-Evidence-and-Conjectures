To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

P(B|A') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 according to the problem statement.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population statistics is:

{probability: 0.414}
