{probability: 0.75}

Here's how I arrived at this estimate:

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.41379...
       â‰ˆ 0.75

Therefore, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
