To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 according to the information provided.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).

Assuming that the witness has an equal chance of misidentifying a white person as black (0.2), we have:
P(B|A') = 0.2
P(A') = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the population)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
