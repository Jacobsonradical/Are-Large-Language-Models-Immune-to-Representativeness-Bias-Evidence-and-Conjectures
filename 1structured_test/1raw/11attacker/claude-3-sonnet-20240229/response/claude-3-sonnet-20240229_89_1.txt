To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.27

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the base rates, is:

{probability: 0.444}
