To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
- The witness errs in 20% of cases.
- 15% of the population in the city is black.
- 85% of the population in the city is white.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / P(W)

P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).

P(W) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (assuming the error rate of 20% applies to both races)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
