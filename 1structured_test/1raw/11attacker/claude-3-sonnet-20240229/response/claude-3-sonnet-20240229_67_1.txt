To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence.

Given information:
- Prior probability of the attacker being white: 85%
- Prior probability of the attacker being black: 15%
- Witness correctly identifies a black person as black: 80%
- Witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black: 20%

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15.

P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of two cases:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the prior probabilities, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
