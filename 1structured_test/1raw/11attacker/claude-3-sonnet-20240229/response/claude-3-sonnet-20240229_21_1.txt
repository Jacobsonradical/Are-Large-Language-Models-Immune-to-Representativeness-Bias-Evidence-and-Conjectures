To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W|W) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white)

Let's denote:
- P(B|W) = the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.68)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(B|W) = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.15}
