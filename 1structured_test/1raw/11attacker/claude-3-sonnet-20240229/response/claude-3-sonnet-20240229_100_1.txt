To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as black, with an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying race correctly.
- 15% of the population in the city is black, and 85% is white.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white).

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15.
We also know that P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).
And P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
