To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let:
- B: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Given information:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution)
- P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (Assuming the witness has a 20% error rate for identifying white people as black)
         = 0.33

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.33
        = 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.36}
