To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)

Let P(B|W) be the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / (P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B))
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
