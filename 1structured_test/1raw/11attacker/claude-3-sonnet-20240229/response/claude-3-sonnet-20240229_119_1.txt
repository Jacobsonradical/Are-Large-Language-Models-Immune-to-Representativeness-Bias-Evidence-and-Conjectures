To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
