To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. From the given information, this is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
- P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
