To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the population statistics) with the likelihood of the witness's statement, given the attacker's race.

Given information:
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of cases.
- 15% of the population in the city is black.
- 85% of the population in the city is white.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The attacker is white.
- S: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|S), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|S) = [P(S|B) × P(B)] / [P(S|B) × P(B) + P(S|W) × P(W)]

P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black, based on population statistics)
P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white, based on population statistics)

P(S|B) = 0.8 (likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(S|W) = 0.2 (likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Substituting the values:
P(B|S) = (0.8 × 0.15) / [(0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)]
P(B|S) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|S) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|S) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
