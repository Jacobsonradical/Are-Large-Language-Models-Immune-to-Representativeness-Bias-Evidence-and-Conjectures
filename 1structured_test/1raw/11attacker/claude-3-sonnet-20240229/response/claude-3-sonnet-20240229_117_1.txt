To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the population is 85% non-black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
