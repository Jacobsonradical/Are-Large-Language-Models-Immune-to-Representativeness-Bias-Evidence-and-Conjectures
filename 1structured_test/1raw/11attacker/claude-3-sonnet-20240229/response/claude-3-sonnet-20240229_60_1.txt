To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given some prior knowledge.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).

Substituting the known values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
