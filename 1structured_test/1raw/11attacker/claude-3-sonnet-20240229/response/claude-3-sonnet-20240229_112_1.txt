To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given information:
- P(white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(witness correct | black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | black) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time)
- P(witness correct | white) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(black | witness says black), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(black | witness says black) = (P(witness says black | black) × P(black)) / ((P(witness says black | black) × P(black)) + (P(witness says black | white) × P(white)))

P(witness says black | black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(witness says black | white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(black | witness says black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / ((0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85))
P(black | witness says black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(black | witness says black) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(black | witness says black) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
