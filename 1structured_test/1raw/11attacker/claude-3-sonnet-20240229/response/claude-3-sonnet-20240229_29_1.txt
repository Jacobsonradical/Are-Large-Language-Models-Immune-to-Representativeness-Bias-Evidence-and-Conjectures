To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.444}
