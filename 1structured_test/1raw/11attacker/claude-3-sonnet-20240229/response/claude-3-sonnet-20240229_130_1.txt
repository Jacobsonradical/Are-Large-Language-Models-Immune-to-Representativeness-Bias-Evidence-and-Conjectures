To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black (which is 0.8 according to the information provided).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(A') = 0.85.

We don't know P(B|A'), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black. However, we can use the information that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
