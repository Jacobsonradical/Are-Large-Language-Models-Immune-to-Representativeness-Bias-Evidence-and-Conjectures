To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population statistics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, where A' is the event that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.444}
