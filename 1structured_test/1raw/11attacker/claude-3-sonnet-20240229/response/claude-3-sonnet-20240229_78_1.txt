To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

B: The attacker is black.
W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

We know the following from the given information:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(W|¬B) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(W) = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
P(B|W) ≈ 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.444}
