To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given by the population demographics)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W) as follows:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the witness's accuracy rate, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
