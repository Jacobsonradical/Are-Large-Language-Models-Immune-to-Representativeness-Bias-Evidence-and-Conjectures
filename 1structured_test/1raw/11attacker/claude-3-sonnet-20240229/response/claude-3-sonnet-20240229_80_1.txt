To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(W) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which we need to calculate.

To calculate P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|!B) * P(!B)

Where:
- P(W|!B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(!B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
