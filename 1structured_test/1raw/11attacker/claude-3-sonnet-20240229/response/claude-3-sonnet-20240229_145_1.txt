To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the evidence (the witness's identification) and the prior probabilities of the attacker's race.

Given:
- P(witness correct | attacker is black) = 0.8
- P(witness incorrect | attacker is black) = 0.2
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (based on the population distribution)
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (based on the population distribution)

Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as black as W.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / P(W)

P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8.

P(W) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.444}
