To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given some prior information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is black, and the attacker is white.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in the Bayes' Theorem equation, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
