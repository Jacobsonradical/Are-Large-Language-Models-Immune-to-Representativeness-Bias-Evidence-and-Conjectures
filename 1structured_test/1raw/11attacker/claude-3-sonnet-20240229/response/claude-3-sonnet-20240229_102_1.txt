To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A given B, P(A|B), as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (or 80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (or 15%) based on the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we need to apply the total probability theorem:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (or 85%).

We don't know P(B|A'), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. However, we know that the witness has an error rate of 20%, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
