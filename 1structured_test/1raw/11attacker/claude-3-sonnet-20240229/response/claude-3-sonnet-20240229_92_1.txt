To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (Prior probability that a person in the city is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W|notB) = 0.2 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / (P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|notB) × P(notB))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
