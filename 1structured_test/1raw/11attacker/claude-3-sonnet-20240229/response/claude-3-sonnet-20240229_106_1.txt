To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (provided as 0.8 or 80%)
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (given as 0.15 or 15%)
- P(W) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white.

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the provided information, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
