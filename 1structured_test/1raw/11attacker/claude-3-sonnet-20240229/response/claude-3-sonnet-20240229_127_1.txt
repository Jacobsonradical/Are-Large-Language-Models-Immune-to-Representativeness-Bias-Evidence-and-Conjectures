To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is white)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.414}
