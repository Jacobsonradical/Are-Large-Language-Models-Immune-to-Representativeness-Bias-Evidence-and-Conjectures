To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- Witness identifies the attacker as black.
- Witness's accuracy in identifying race under similar conditions:
  - Correctly identifies 80% of the time.
  - Errs 20% of the time.
- Population composition:
  - 85% white
  - 15% black

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A')
where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white).

We know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy for identifying black individuals)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness's error rate for identifying non-black individuals, which is 1 - accuracy)
- P(A') = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being white)

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population composition, is:

{probability: 0.414}
