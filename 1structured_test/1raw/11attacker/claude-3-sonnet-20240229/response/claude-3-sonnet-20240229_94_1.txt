To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. We have the following information:

- P(B) = 0.15: The prior probability that the attacker is black (given the population distribution)
- P(W) = 0.85: The prior probability that the attacker is white
- P(E|B) = 0.8: The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (hit rate)
- P(E|W) = 0.2: The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (false alarm rate)

We want to find P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
