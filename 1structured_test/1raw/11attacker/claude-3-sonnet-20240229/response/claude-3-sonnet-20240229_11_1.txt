To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(W) = 0.85 (Probability that a person chosen at random from the city is white)
- P(B) = 0.15 (Probability that a person chosen at random from the city is black)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
