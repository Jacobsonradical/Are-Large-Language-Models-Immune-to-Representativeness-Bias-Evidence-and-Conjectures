To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population statistics.
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can substitute the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
