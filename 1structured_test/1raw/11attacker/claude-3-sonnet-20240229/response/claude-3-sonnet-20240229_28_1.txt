To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.27

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
P(A|B) ≈ 0.444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.444 or 44.4%.
