To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given information:
- P(white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(witness correct | black) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | black) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
- P(witness correct | white) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies white people 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | white) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white people 20% of the time)

We want to find P(black | witness says black), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(black | witness says black) = (P(witness says black | black) * P(black)) / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black | black) = 0.8 (given information)
P(black) = 0.15 (given information)

P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | black) * P(black) + P(witness says black | white) * P(white)
P(witness says black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444444...

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.44 or 44.4%.
