To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given by the population ratio)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, where A^c is the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is not black)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
