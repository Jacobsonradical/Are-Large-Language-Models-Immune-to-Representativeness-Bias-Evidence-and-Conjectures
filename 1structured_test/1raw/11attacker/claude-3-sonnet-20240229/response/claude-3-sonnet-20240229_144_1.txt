To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the new evidence provided by the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To calculate P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Where:
- P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
- P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
