To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (The population of black people in the city is 15%)
- P(B) needs to be calculated

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We don't know P(B|A'), but we can calculate it using the information provided:
P(B|A') = 1 - P(correct identification for white people) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
