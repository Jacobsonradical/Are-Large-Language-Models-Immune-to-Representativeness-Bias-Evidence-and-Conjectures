To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability based on the given evidence.

Let:
- P(B) be the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) be the prior probability that the attacker is white
- P(E|B) be the probability of the witness's evidence (identifying the attacker as black) given that the attacker is actually black
- P(E|W) be the probability of the witness's evidence given that the attacker is actually white

From the given information, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's evidence:

P(B|E) = (P(E|B) × P(B)) / (P(E|B) × P(B) + P(E|W) × P(W))
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's evidence, is:

{probability: 0.41379}
