To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on prior knowledge.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.27

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the prior information, is:

{probability: 0.444}
