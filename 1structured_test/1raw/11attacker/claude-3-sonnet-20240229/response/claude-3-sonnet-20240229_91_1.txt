To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (Prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
