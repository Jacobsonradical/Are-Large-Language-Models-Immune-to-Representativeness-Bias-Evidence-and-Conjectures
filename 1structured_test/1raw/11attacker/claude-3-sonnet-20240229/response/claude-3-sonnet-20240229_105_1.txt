To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population data.
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white. This is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.
- P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), which is 0.85.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population data, is:

{probability: 0.414}
