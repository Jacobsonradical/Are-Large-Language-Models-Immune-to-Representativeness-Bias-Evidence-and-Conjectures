To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
