To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85 = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.444}
