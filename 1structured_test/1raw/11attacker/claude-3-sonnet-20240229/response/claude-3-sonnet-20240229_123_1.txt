To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).

We know that:
- P(B|A') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
