To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let:
- A: The event that the attacker is black
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 or approximately 41.38%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the witness's ability to judge race, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
