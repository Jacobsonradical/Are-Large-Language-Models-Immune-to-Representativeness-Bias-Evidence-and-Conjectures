To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is not black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black, since 85% of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
