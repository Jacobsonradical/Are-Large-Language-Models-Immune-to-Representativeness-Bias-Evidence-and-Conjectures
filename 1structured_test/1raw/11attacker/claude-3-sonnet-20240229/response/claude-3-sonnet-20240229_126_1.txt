To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (0.8 according to the given information)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15 according to the population statistics)
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where:
- P(B|A') is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (0.2 according to the given information)
- P(A') is the prior probability of the attacker not being black (0.85 according to the population statistics)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.414 or 41.4%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
