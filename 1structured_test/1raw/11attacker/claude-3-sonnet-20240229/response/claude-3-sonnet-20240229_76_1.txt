To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness identified the attacker as black with an accuracy of 80%.
- The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white).
  P(B|A') is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
  P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
