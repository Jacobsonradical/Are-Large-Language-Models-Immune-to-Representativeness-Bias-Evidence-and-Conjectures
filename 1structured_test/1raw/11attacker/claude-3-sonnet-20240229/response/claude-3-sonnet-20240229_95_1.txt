To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population statistics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the event that the attacker is not black (white)

We don't have the value of P(B|A^c), but we can calculate it using the information that the witness errs 20% of the time:
P(B|A^c) = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
