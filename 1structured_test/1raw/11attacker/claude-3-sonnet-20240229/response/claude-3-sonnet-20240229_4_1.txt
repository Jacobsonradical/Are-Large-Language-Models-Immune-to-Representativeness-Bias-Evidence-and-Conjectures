To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given information:
- P(white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(witness correctly identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrectly identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies black 20% of the time)

Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as W.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

where:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying black given that the attacker is black)
P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying black given that the attacker is white)
P(~B) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the provided information, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
