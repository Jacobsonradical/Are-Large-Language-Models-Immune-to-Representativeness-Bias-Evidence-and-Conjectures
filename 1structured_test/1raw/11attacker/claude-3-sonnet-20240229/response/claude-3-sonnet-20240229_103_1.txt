To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness correctly identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
  P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
  P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.444}
