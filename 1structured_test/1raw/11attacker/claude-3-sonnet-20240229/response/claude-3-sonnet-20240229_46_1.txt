To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events given each other. We have the following information:

- P(B) = 0.15: The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution.
- P(W|B) = 0.8: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(W|~B) = 0.2: The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
