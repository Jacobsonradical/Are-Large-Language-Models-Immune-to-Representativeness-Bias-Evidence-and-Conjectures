To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the event that the attacker is not black

We need to find P(B|A^c), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time for both races, the probability of an error for a non-black person is 0.2.

P(B|A^c) = 0.2

P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
