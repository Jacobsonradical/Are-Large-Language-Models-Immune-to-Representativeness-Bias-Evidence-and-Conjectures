To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. We have the following information:

1. The prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is black is 0.15 (15%).
2. The likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80%).
3. The likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person is black, which is 0.15.
P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444

{probability: 0.444}
