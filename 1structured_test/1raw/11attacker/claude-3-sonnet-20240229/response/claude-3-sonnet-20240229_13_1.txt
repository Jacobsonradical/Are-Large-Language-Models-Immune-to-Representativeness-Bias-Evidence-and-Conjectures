To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black (0.8 from the information given)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15 from the population distribution)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white in this case), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, but we don't know P(B|A'). However, we can calculate it using the information that the witness errs 20% of the time:

P(B|A') = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.414}
