To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events based on the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.444}
