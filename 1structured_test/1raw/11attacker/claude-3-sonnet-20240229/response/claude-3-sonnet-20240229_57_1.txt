To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. From the information provided, this is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not black.

Assuming that the witness has an equal chance of incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (20%), we have:
P(B|~A) = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 or 41.4%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
