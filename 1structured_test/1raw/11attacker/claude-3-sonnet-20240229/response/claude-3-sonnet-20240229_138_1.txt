To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
