To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events as follows:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population demographics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is 0.2 (20%) since the witness errs 20% of the time.
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
