To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

B: The attacker is black
W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution)
- P(W) = P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B), where P(W|¬B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, and P(¬B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black.

We don't have the value of P(W|¬B), but we can calculate it using the information provided. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and there are only two races (black and white), the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.414.
