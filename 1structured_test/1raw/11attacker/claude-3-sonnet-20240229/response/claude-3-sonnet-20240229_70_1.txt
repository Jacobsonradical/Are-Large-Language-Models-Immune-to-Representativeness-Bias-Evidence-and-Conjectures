To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(W) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the race)
- P(¬W) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the race)
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(¬B) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) × P(B)] / [P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 × 0.15] / [0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
