To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population statistics)
- P(A') = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is white)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification and population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
