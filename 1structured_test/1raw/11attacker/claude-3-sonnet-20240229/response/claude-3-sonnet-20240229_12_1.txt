To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. We have two pieces of evidence: the witness's identification and the population statistics.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the population statistics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
  = 0.29 (the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
