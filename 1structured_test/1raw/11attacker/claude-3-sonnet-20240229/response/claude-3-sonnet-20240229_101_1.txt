To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Given information:
- Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- Prior probability of the attacker being white = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.2

Let's denote the event "the attacker is black" as B and the event "the witness identified the attacker as black" as W.

We want to calculate P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

P(W|B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
        = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

P(B) = Prior probability of the attacker being black
      = 0.15

P(W) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black
      = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137 or 41.37%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
