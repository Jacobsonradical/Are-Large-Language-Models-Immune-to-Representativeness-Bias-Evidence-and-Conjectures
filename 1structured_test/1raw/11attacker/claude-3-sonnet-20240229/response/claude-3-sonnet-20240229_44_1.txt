To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, but we don't know P(B|A'). However, we can use the given information that the witness errs 20% of the time to find P(B|A') = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
