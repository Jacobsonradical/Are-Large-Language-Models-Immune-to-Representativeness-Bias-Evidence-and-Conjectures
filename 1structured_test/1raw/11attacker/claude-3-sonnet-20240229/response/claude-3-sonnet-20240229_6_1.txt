To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the prior probability based on the given evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, since 15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|¬B) × P(¬B)
  = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (assuming the witness misidentifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.12 / 0.29
        ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
