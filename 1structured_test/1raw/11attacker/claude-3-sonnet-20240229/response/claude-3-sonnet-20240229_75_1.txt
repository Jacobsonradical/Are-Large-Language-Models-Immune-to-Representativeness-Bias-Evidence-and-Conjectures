To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time (P(correct identification) = 0.8).
- 85% of the population in the city is white (P(white) = 0.85), and 15% is black (P(black) = 0.15).

Let's denote:
- P(B|W) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black when they are actually white.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as white when they are actually black.

We know that P(B|W) + P(correct identification for white) = 1, and P(W|B) + P(correct identification for black) = 1.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we have:
P(B|W) = 0.2 (error rate for identifying a white person as black)
P(W|B) = 0.2 (error rate for identifying a black person as white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(black|witness identifies as black) = [P(witness identifies as black|black) × P(black)] / [P(witness identifies as black|black) × P(black) + P(witness identifies as black|white) × P(white)]
P(black|witness identifies as black) = [(0.8 × 0.15)] / [(0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)]
P(black|witness identifies as black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(black|witness identifies as black) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(black|witness identifies as black) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
