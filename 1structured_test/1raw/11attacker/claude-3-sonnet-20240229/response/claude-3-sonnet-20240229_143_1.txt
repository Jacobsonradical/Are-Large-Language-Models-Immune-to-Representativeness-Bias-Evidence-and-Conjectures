To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. We have the following information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as black, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying race under similar conditions.
2. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%, given that 15% of the population in the city is black.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

where:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).
P(not B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the prior probabilities, is:

{probability: 0.41379}
