To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given some prior knowledge.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black (0.8 according to the information provided)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15 according to the population statistics)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
