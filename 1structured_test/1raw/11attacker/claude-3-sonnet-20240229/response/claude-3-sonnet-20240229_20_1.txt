To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. From the information provided, we know that this probability is 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, but we don't have information about P(B|A'), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. However, we can calculate it using the given information that the witness errs 20% of the time:

P(B|A') = 0.2

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 â‰ˆ 0.444

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.444}
