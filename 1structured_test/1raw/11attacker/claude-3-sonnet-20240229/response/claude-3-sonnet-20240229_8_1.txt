To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the events involved.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(W|notB) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = (P(W|B) × P(B)) / (P(W|B) × P(B) + P(W|notB) × P(notB))

Substituting the given values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and their accuracy rate, is:

{probability: 0.414}
