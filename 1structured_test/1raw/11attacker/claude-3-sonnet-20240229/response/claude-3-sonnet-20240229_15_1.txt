To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their prior probabilities.

Given:
- Prior probability of the attacker being black (P(B)) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- Prior probability of the attacker being white (P(W)) = 0.85 (85% of the population)
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (P(I|B)) = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (P(I|W)) = 0.2

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(B|I)) is:

P(B|I) = (P(I|B) × P(B)) / (P(I|B) × P(B) + P(I|W) × P(W))

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138 or 41.38%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
