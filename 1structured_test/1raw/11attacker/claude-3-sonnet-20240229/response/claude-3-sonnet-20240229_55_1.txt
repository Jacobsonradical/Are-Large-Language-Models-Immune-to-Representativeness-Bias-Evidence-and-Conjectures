To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the prior probability (based on the population statistics) with the new evidence provided by the witness's testimony.

Given:
- The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- The prior probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (85% of the population).
- The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8.
- The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The attacker is white.
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = (P(E|B) * P(B)) / (P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

P(E|B) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
P(W) = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is white)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.414}
