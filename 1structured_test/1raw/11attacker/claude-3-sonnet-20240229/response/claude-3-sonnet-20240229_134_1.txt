To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
