To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

Given:
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time (true positive rate).
- The witness erred in 20% of the cases (false positive rate).
- 15% of the population in the city is black (prior probability).

Let's represent the probability that the attacker is black as P(B) and the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white) as P(W).

We know that:
P(B) + P(W) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B|witness) = (P(witness|B) × P(B)) / (P(witness|B) × P(B) + P(witness|W) × P(W))

Where:
- P(witness|B) is the true positive rate, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(witness|W) is the false positive rate, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(W) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|witness) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(B|witness) ≈ 0.43 (or 43%)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.43 or 43%.
