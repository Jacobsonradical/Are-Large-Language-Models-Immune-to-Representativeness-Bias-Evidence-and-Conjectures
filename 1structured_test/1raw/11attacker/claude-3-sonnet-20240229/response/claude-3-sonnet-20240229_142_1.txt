To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(witness correct | attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | attacker is white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

We want to find P(attacker is black | witness says black), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (P(witness says black | attacker is black) × P(attacker is black)) / (P(witness says black | attacker is black) × P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) × P(attacker is white))

Substituting the given values:
P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
                                         = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                         = 0.12 / 0.29
                                         ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population demographics is:

{probability: 0.4138}
