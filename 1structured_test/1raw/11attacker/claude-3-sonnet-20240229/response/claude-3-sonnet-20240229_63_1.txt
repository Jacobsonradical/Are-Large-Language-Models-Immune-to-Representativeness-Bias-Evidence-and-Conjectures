To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the given evidence.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified 80% of black people)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified 20% of white people as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.414}
