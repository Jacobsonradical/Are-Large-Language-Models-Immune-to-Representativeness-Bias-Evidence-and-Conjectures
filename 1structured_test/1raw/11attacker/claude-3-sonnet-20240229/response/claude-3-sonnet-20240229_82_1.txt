To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.444444}
