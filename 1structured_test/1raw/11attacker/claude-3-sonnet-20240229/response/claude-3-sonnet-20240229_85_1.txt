To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 in the problem statement (assuming the population distribution is representative of the attacker's race).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. We can calculate this using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'), where A' is the event that the attacker is not black (white).

We don't have the value of P(B|A'), but we know that P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases.

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
