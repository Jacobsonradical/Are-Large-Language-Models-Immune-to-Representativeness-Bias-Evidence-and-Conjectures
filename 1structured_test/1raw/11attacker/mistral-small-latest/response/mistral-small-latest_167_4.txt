{probability: 0.879, explanation: This is a conditional probability question. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E). According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E). We know P(B) = 0.15 from the first piece of information. From the second piece of information, P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person is black). To find P(E), we need to consider both possibilities: P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W). Since the witness is 20% likely to misidentify a white person as black, P(E|W) = 0.2, and P(W) = 0.85. Plugging these values into the equation for P(E), we get P(E) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.21. Finally, we can calculate P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.879.}
