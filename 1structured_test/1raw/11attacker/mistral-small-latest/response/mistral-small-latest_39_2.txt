{probability: 0.864,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B).
2. We know that 15% of the population is black, so our initial probability is 0.15.
3. However, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
4. So, if the attacker was indeed black, the probability that the witness would correctly identify them as black is 0.8.
5. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker given that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
6. Now, we need to consider the possibility that the witness might incorrectly identify a white person as black. This happens 20% of the time when the person is actually white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
7. However, this does not mean that the attacker is definitely black. We need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony. The witness is twice as likely to correctly identify a black person than to incorrectly identify a white person (0.12 vs 0.17).
8. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.864.
