Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

We know from the information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Now we can calculate P(B|E):

P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.565

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.565.
