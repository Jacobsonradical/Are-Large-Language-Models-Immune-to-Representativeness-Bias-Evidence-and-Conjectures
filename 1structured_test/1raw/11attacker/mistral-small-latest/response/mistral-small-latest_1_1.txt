{probability: 0.64,

Explanation:
Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the information given, P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black), P(B) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white), and P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|not B) * 0.85.

We don't know P(W|not B) directly, but we know that the witness makes errors in 20% of cases, so P(W|not B) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.}
