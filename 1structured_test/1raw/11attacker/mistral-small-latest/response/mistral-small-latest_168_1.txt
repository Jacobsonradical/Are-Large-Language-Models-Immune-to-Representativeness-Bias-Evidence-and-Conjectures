{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is the prior probability of the attacker being white (0.85) multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error (0.2), which gives 0.17. So, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
