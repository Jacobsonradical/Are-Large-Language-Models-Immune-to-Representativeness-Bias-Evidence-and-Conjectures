{probability: 0.875}

Explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This is the prior probability.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. So, if the attacker was actually black, the probability that the witness would correctly identify them as black is 0.8.
3. However, there's also a chance that the witness could incorrectly identify a white person as black. This is 20% of the time (0.2), and since 85% of the population is white, this error would occur with a probability of 0.17 (0.2 * 0.85).
4. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) = 0.875.
