{probability: 0.855, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W). Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W). We know from the information that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black). According to the witness's accuracy, P(W|B) = 0.8 (80% of the time the witness correctly identifies a black person). To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker being black and the witness being correct, and the attacker being white and the witness making an error. So, P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21. Therefore, P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.855.}
