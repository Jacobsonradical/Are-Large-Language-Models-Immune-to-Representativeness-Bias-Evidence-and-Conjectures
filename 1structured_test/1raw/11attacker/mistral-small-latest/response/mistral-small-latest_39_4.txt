{probability: 0.72, given the information, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.72.}
