{probability: 0.752, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W). According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W). Here, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B), where P(not B) = 0.85, and P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.20 (20% error rate). Calculating P(W), we get 0.75. Therefore, P(B|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.75 â‰ˆ 0.752.}
