{probability: 0.42, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (given by information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (given by information a). So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.42.}
