{probability: 0.45, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness) where witness is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B)P(B)] / [P(witness|B)P(B) + P(witness|W)P(W)].

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person being black) and P(W) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person being white).

P(witness|B) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate for black people).

P(witness|W) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (the witness's error rate for white people).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get P(B|witness) â‰ˆ 0.45. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.45.}
