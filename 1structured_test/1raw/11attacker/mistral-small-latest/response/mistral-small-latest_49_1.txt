{probability: 0.57,
The problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black and W represent the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
P(W) = 0.85
P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race as black 20% of the time when the attacker is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values:
P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.57}
