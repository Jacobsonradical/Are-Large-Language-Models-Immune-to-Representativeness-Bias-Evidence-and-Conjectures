{probability: 0.54,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve it. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), where "witness" is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / P(witness).

From the given information, P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

P(witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W), where P(W) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.54. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.54.}
