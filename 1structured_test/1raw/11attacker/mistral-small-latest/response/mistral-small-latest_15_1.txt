{probability: 0.65}

This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

According to the information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
- P(W) = 0.85
- P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values: P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.65
