{probability: 0.592,

Explanation: This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

We know that P(B) = 0.15 (from information b), and P(W) = 0.85.

We also know that P(witness|B) = 0.8 (from information a), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.

Similarly, P(witness|W) = 0.2, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|witness) as follows:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / (P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.592

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.592.}
