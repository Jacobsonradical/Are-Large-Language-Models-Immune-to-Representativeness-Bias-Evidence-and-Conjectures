{probability: 0.704, This is calculated by first considering the base rate of black people in the city (0.15). Then, we factor in the witness's accuracy in identifying race (0.8) and their error rate (0.2). The probability that the witness correctly identified a black person is then 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or approximately 0.704 when considered as a proportion of the total population.}
