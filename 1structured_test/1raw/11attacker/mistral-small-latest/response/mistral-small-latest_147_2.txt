{probability: 0.58, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We are given that P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city) and P(W) = 0.85. We also know that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(witness says black | B) = 0.8. Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(witness says black | W) = 0.2. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B | witness says black) = [P(B) * P(witness says black | B)] / [P(B) * P(witness says black | B) + P(W) * P(witness says black | W)] = (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)] = 0.58.}
