{probability: 0.636, explanation: This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics, is 0.15. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black, which is approximately 0.636.}
