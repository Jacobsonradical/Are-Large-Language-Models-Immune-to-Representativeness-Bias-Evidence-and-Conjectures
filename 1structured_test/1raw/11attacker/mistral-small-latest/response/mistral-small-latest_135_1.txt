{probability: 0.64, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. The witness's accuracy doesn't change the overall population distribution, but it does give us an estimate of the likelihood of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%). Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.64.}
