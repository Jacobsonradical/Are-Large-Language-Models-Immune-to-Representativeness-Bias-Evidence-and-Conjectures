{probability: 0.57, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of a random person in the city being black is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (since they misidentify in 20% of cases). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.57.}
