{probability: 0.55, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.2 * 0.85).}
