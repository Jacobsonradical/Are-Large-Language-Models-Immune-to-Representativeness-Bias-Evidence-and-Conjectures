{probability: 0.56, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony can be calculated as follows: P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]. Here, P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 according to the given information. P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8. P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85). Substituting these values into the formula, we get P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.56.}
