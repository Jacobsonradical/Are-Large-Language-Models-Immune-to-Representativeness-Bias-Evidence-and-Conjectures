{probability: 0.68, The estimate is based on applying Bayes' theorem to the given information. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (80% accuracy). Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.68 or 68%.}
