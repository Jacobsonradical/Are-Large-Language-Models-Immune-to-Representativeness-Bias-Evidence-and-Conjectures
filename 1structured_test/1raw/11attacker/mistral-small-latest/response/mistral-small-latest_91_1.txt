{probability: 0.545, This calculation is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from information b) that the attacker is black is 0.15. The likelihood (from information a) that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8, and the likelihood that the witness would identify a white person as black is 0.2. The posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement) is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)), which is approximately 0.545.}
