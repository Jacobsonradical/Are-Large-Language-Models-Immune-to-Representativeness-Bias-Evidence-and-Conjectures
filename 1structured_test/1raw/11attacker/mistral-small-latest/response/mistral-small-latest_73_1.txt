{probability: 0.46, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The witness identified the attacker as black, and based on their accuracy, there's an 80% chance they're correct. However, we also need to consider the base rate, which is the proportion of black people in the city (15%). So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85), which equals approximately 0.46 or 46%.}
