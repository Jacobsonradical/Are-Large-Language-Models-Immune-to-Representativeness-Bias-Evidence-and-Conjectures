{probability: 0.64,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the city's population demographics. This is 0.15 or 15%.
2. Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time.
3. Since the attacker could have been either white or black, and the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to account for the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is mistaken.
4. If the attacker is indeed black, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker's race.
5. If the attacker is white, the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying the attacker as black.
6. Given the city's population demographics, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 or 85%.
7. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.
8. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's testimony, is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8) plus the probability that the attacker is white and the witness is mistaken (0.85 * 0.2), which equals 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
9. However, we need to adjust this probability because the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness made an identification, the probability that the attacker is black becomes 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.17) = 0.64 or 64%.
10. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.}
