{probability: 0.43,

Here's the reasoning:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness says black), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|witness says black) = [P(witness says black|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness says black|B) * P(B) + P(witness says black|W) * P(W)]

From the information given, we know that:
- P(witness says black|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(witness says black|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B|witness says black) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.43

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.43.
