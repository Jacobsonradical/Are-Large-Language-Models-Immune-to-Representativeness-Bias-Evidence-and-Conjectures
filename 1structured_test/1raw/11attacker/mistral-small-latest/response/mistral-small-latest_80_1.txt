{probability: 0.64, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black is around 0.64. The calculation involves the prior probability (0.15), the witness's accuracy (0.8) and error rate (0.2), and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (true positive rate) and a white person as black (false positive rate).}
