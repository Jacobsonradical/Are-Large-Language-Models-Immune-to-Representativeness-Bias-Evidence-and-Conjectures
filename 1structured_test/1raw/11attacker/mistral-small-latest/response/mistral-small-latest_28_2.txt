{probability: 0.89,

Explanation: We use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We are given:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Let E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We are also given:

P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       â‰ˆ 0.89

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.89.}
