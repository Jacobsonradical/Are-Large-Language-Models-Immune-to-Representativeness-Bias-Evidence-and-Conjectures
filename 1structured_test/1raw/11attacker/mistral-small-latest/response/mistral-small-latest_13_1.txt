{probability: 0.68,

Explanation: This is a classic problem of conditional probability. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the information given:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

Assuming the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the population, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85
Assuming the witness makes errors at random, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is P(W|not B) = 0.1 (20% error rate).

So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Therefore, P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.68

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.68.}
