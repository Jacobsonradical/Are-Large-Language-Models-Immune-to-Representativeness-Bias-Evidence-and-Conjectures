{probability: 0.72, Your estimate is that there is a 72% probability that the attacker is black.}

This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

First, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Second, we know that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8. Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 10% of the time (since half of the 20% errors were identifying black people as white), so P(witness|W) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85]
