{probability: 0.755,

This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the attacker is white.

We know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, so we can say that P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8. Similarly, P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2, because the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B | witness says black) = P(witness says black | B) * P(B) / [P(witness says black | B) * P(B) + P(witness says black | W) * P(W)].

Substituting the values, we get P(B | witness says black) â‰ˆ 0.755, which is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.}
