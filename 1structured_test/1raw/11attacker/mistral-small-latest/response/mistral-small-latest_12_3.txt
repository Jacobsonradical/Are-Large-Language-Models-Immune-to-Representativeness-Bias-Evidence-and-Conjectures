{probability: 0.64, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black). P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

P(E|W) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). So, P(E|W) = 0.2.

P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.22.

So, P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.64. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.}
