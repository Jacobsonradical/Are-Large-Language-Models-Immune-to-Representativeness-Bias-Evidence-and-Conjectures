{probability: 0.68, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.80 * 0.15) by the probability of the witness making a correct identification, and then dividing by the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85).}
