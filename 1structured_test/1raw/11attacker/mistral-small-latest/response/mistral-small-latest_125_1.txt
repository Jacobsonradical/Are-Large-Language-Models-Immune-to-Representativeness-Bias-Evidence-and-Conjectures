{probability: 0.52,
This is a problem of conditional probability, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Given the witness's accuracy rate and the population distribution, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the problem, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

P(witness|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(witness|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.52 (rounded to two decimal places)}
