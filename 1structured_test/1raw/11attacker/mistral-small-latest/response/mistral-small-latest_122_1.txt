{probability: 0.47, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), where the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15, P(W) = 0.85, P(witness|B) = 0.8, and P(witness|W) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(B|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.47}
