{probability: 0.55, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate). So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)) = 0.55.}
