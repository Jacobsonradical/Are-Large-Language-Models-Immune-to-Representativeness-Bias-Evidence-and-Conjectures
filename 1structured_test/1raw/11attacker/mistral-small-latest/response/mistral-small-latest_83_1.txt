{probability: 0.4909,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(witness|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(witness|W) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4909

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4909 or 49.09%.}
