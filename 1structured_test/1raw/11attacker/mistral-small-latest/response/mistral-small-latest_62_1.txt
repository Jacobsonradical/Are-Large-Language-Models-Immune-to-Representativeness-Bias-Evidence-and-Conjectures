{probability: 0.86, based on Bayes' theorem and the given information.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white.
2. We have prior probabilities P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
3. Let E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
4. Given the witness's accuracy, we have P(E|B) = 0.8 and P(E|W) = 0.2.
5. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]
7. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.86.
8. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.86.
