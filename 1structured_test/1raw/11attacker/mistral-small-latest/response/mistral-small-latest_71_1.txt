{probability: 0.61, The estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability (information b), the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black (80% from information a), and the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are white (20% error rate from information a).}
