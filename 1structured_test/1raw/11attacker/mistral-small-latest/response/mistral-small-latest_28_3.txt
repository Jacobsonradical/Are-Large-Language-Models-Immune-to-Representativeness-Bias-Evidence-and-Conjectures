{probability: 0.79, Given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability (P(B)) of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black (P(W|B)) is 0.8 (80% accuracy). And the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (P(W|not B)) is 0.1 (20% error rate multiplied by the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85). Therefore, the posterior probability (P(B|W)) that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.79.}
