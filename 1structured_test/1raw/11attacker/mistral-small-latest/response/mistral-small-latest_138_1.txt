{probability: 0.5385, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given data, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black),
P(W) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white),
P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time),
P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.5385}
