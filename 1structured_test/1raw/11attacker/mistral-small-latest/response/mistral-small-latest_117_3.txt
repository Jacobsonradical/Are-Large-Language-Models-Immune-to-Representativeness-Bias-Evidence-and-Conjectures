{probability: 0.752, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% of the population is black). The likelihood is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.752.}
