{probability: 0.76, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification and the population distribution. The prior probability (P(B)) that the attacker is black is 0.15. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (P(W|B)) is 0.8. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (P(W|not B)) is (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.1. Therefore, the posterior probability (P(B|W)) that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is calculated as follows: P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.76.}
