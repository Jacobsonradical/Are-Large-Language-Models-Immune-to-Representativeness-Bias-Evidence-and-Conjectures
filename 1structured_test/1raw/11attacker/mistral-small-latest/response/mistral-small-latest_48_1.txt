{probability: 0.63,

Here's the reasoning:

1. The base rate of black people in the city is 15%.
2. The witness is correct in identifying race 80% of the time.
3. So, if the attacker were black, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as black.
4. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
5. However, the witness could also identify a white person as black. This happens 20% of the time given a sample of people that is half white and half black.
6. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is therefore 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.
7. So, the total probability that the witness identified a black person (either correctly or incorrectly) is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22.
8. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can now use this probability to estimate the likelihood that the attacker is actually black.
9. This is done by dividing the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.12) by the total probability of the witness identifying a black person (0.22).
10. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 / 0.22 = 0.63 or 63%.
