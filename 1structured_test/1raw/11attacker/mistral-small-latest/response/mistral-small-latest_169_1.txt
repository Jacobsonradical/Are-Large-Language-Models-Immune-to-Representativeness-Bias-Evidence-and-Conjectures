{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. The witness's accuracy in identifying a person's race is 80%, so the probability that the witness correctly identified the black attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Taking into account the possibility of misidentifying a white person as black (20% error rate for the 85% white population), we get 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives us a total probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, this is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, not the probability that the attacker is actually black. To find that, we need to divide by the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, whether they are black or white: 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.71 * 0.2) = 0.64. This is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.}
