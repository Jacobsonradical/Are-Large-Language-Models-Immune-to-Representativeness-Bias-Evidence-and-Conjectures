{probability: 0.891, given the witness's accuracy and the racial composition of the city}

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. We start with the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
2. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person and a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying a white person as black.
3. So, if the attacker were actually black, there is an 0.80 probability that the witness would correctly identify them as such.
4. If the attacker were white, there is a 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 probability that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.
5. Therefore, the total probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.03 = 0.12 + 0.025 = 0.145.
6. However, this is the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black. We want the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem.
7. Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. Similarly, let P(W|not B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.
8. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
9. P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.0255 = 0.1455
10. Therefore, P(B|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.1455 â‰ˆ 0.891

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.891.
