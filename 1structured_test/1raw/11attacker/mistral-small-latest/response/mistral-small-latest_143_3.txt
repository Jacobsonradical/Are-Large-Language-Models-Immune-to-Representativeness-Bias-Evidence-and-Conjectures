{probability: 0.566, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (the base rate of blacks in the population) is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is black is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is white is the error rate, 0.2. So, the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's observation) is approximately 0.566.}
