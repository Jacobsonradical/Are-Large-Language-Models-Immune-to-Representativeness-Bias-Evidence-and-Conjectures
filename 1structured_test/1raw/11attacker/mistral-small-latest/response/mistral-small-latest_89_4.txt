{probability: 0.53, explanation: This is a probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the witness correctly identified the race. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as such.

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|B^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, since there are only two races in this case)
P(B) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
P(B^c) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|B^c) * P(B^c)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.53}
