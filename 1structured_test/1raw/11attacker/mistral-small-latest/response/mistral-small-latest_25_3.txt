{probability: 0.69, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). And the likelihood that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.69.}
