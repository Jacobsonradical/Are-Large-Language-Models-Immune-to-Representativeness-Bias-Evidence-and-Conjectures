{probability: 0.64, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Let's break it down:

1. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, given the racial distribution in the city.
2. The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
4. However, the witness could also have mistakenly identified a white person as black. The probability of this is 0.2 (20%) times the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85. So, 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
5. Therefore, the total probability that the witness identified a black person (either correctly or mistakenly) is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
6. To find the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
7. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
