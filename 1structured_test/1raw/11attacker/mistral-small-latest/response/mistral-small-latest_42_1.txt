{probability: 0.53, Given the witness's accuracy and the racial distribution of the city, the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% black population). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.53.}
