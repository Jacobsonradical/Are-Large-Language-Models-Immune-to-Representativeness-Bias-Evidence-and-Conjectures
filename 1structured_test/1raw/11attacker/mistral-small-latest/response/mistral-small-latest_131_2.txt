{probability: 0.88, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is calculated as follows:
P(black|witness_says_black) = [P(witness_says_black|black) * P(black)] / [P(witness_says_black|black) * P(black) + P(witness_says_black|white) * P(white)]
Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies black people: P(witness_says_black|black) = 0.8
The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black, so P(black) = 0.15 and P(white) = 0.85
We need to find P(witness_says_black|white), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, and half of the mistakes are likely to be identifying white people as black: P(witness_says_black|white) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1
Plugging these values into the formula, we get: P(black|witness_says_black) â‰ˆ 0.88}
