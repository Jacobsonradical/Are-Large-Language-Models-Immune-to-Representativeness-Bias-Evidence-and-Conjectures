{probability: 0.625,

Explanation: This is a classic problem in probability theory, specifically related to Bayes' theorem.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)].

From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

We also know that P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.625.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.625.
