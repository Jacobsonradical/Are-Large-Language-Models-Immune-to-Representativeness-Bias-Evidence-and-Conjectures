{probability: 0.877, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is calculated as follows: P(Black|Witness) = [P(Witness|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness|Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness|White) * P(White)]. Here, P(Black) = 0.15, P(White) = 0.85, P(Witness|Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), and P(Witness|White) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time). Substituting these values, we get P(Black|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.877.}
