{probability: 0.64, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony. The prior probability (P(B)) that the attacker is black is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (P(W|B)) is 0.8. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (P(W|not B)) is 0.1 (since half of the errors are made in this direction). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)) = 0.64}
