{probability: 0.64, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness might have incorrectly identified a white person as black. The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20% error rate) and the prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85% of the population). So, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black (either correctly identified or misidentified) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, since the question asks for the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to divide this by the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This includes correctly identifying a black person as black (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12) and incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17), which adds up to 0.29. So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.64 or 64%.}
