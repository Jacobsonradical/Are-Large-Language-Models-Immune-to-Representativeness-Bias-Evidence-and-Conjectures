{probability: 0.864, explanation: This is a Bayes' Theorem problem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

From the problem, P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time when the person is black), and P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness made an error 20% of the time when the person is white).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.864}
