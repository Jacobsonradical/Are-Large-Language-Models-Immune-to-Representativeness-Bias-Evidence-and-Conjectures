{probability: 0.64,

This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E).

We're given that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

We're also given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when it's black, so P(E|B) = 0.8. If the attacker is white, the witness will identify them as black with a 20% error rate, so P(E|W) = 0.2.

P(E) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28.

So, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.64.
