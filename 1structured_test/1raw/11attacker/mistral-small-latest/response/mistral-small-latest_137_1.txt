{probability: 0.784, The probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' Theorem. Given the witness's accuracy, the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%), and the prior probability of the attacker being white (85%), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.784 or 78.4%.}
