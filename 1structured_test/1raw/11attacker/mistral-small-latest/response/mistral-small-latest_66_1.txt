Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem: P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

From the information:
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying white people as black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city)

To calculate P(E), we need to use the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

So, P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.47}.
