{probability: 0.59,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem, where we want to find P(attacker is black | witness identified attacker as black). We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

where:
B = event that the attacker is black
W = event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know from the problem that P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).
We also know from the problem that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is black or the attacker is white.

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

We know P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. We also know that P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white). Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black in 20% of cases, P(W|not B) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, substituting into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.59

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.59.
