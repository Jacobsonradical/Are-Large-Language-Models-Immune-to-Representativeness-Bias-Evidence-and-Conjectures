{probability: 0.55, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 due to the population distribution (b). The likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (a). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.55}
