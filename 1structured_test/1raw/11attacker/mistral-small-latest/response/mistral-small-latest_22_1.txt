{probability: 0.45, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem and the given information. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80% correct identification rate). Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as such, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.45.}
