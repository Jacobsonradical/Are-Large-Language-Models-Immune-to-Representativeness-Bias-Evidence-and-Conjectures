{probability: 0.46, The witness identified the attacker as black, but they have a 20% error rate in identifying race. Given that 15% of the population in the city is black, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. The calculation is as follows: (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.46. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.46.}
