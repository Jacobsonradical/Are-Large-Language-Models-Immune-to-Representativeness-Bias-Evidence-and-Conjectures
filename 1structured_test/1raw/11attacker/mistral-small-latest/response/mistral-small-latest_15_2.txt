{probability: 0.59, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). So, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the person is black, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.04 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people). So, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.04 = 0.034. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.034) = 0.59.}
