{probability: 0.73, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time. So, if the attacker was black, there is an 80% chance the witness would identify them correctly. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness could incorrectly identify a white person as black. Given that 85% of the population is white, there is a 17% chance (0.85 * 0.20) that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.73 or 73%.}
