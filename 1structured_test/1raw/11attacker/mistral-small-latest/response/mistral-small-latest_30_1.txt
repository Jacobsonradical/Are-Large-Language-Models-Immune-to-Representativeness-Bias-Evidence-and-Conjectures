{probability: 0.57, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20% error). So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.57. This means there is a 57% chance that the attacker is black.}
