{probability: 0.84,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know from the problem that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The problem also states that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, P(W|not B) = 0.2. And since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.84}
