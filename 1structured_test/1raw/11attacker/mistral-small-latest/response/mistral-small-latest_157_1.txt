{probability: 0.56, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = [P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / P(Witness says black)

P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy in identifying race)
P(Attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the population distribution in the city)
P(Witness says black) = [P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] + [P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) = 1 - P(Witness says white | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases)
P(Attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the population distribution in the city)

So, P(Witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56}
