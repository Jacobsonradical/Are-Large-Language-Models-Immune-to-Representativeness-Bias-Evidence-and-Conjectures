Based on the information provided and using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the attacker is white.
2. We know prior probabilities: P(B) = 0.15 (from information b) and P(W) = 0.85.
3. Let's denote E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
4. We know conditional probabilities: P(E | B) = 0.8 (from information a) and P(E | W) = 0.2 (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time).
5. Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(B | E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
   P(B | E) = P(E | B) * P(B) / (P(E | B) * P(B) + P(E | W) * P(W))

Calculating the values:
P(B | E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B | E) ≈ 0.52 or 52%

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.52}
