{probability: 0.76, Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8 (80%). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.76.}
