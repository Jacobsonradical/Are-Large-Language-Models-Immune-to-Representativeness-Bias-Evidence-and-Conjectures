{probability: 0.52, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is indeed black if the witness says so is 0.8.
2. However, since the witness can also mistakenly identify a white person as black with a probability of 0.1 (20% error rate in identifying black people out of a sample that is half white and half black), we need to account for this possibility as well.
3. The probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes a mistake is 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.085, where 0.85 is the proportion of the white population in the city.
4. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the witness is correct (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12), and the probability that the attacker is white but the witness makes a mistake (0.085).
5. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.52.
