{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15. The probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)), which is approximately 0.54.}
