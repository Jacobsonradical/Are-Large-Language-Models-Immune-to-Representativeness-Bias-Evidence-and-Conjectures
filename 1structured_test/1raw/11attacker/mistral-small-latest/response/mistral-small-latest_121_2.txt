{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from information b) that the attacker is black is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56.}
