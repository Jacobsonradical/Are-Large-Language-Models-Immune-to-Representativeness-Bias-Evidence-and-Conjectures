{probability: 0.76, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (based on the population) is 0.15, and the likelihood (based on the witness's accuracy) is 0.8. So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, plus the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white, gives the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This total probability is 0.12 + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.76.}
