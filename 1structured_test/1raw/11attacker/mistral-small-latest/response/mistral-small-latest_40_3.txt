Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Here's the calculation:

1. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the attacker is white.
2. We know P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
3. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is P(E|B) = 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is P(E|W) = 0.1 (since the errors are evenly distributed).
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony: P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]
5. Plugging in the values, we get: P(B|E) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] ≈ 0.64

So, your estimate is: {probability: 0.64}
