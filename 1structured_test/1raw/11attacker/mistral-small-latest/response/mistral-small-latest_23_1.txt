{probability: 0.68, based on Bayes' theorem calculation}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We know from the information given that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
2. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
3. We need to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.
4. By Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]
5. P(E|B) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%) from the given information.
6. P(E|W) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%) * 0.5 (the probability that a random person is white) = 0.1.
7. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.68.
