{probability: 0.72, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (before considering the witness's statement) that the attacker is black is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (their accuracy rate). So, the posterior probability (after considering the witness's statement) that the attacker is black is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.72.}
