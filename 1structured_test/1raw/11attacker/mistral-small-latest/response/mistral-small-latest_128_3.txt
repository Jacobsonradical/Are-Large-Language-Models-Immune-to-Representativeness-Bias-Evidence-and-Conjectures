{probability: 0.904, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W). Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W). We know P(B) = 0.15 from the city demographics. From the witness's accuracy, P(W|B) = 0.8. The total probability of the witness identifying a person as black is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.904.}
