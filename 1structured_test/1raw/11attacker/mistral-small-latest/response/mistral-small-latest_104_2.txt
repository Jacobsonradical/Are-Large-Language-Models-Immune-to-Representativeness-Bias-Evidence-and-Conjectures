Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

From the information, we know that:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is white)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4615

So, your estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4615.
