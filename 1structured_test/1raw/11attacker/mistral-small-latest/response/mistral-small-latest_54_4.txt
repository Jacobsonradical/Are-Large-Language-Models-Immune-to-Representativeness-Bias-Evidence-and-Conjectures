{probability: 0.45, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of a randomly selected person being black in the city is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is white is 0.2. So, the posterior probability that the attacker is black is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.45}
