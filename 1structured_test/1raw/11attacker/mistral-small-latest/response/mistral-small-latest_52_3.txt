{probability: 0.68, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood that the witness correctly identified a black person is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.68.}
