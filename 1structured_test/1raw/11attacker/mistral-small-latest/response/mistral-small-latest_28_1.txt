{probability: 0.88, Your estimate is 0.88 or 88%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
2. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
3. We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black.
4. Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
5. From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
6. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black, so P(W|B) = 0.8
7. To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker being black and the attacker being white. Using the law of total probability, P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
8. The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so when the attacker is white (which happens with probability 0.85), the witness will incorrectly identify them as black with probability 0.2. Therefore, P(W|not B) = 0.2
9. Substituting values into the equation, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.21
10. Finally, using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 ≈ 0.88

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.88 or 88%.
