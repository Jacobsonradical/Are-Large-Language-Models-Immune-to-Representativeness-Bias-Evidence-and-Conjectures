{probability: 0.69, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8. The probability that the witness would identify a white person as black is 0.1 (since there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, and the witness makes errors 20% of the time). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.69.}
