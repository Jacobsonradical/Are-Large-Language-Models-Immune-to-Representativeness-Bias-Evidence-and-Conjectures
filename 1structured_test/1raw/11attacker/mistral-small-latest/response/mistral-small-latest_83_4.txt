{probability: 0.512,

This is a problem of conditional probability. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

Let's denote:
B = the event that the attacker is black
W = the event that the attacker is white
I = the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are looking for P(B|I), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / P(I)

From the information given:
P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

To find P(I), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is black or the attacker is white.

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(I|W) = 0.2 (this is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

P(W) = 0.85 (since the majority of the population is white)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(I) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(B|I) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.512

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.512.}
