{probability: 0.684, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate * 0.5, assuming half of the errors are identifying white people as black). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.684.}
