{probability: 0.55,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

We know that P(B) = 0.15 (from information b), P(W) = 0.85, P(witness|B) = 0.8 (from information a), and P(witness|W) = 0.2 (from information a).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)].

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.55.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.55.}
