{probability: 0.72,

This is a problem of conditional probability, often referred to as Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know the base rates: P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(witness|W) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
â‰ˆ 0.72

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.72 or 72%.
