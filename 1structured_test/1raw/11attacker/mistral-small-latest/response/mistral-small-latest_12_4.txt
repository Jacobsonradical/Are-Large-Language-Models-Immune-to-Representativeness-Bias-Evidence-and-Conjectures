{probability: 0.74, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15) and the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (0.80). The calculation is: (0.15 * 0.80) / [(0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20)] = 0.74}
