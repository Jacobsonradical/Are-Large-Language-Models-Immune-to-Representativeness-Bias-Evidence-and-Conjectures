Justification: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

P(witness|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is 0.8 according to the witness's accuracy.

P(witness|W) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white. This is 0.2, the error rate of the witness.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.467}
