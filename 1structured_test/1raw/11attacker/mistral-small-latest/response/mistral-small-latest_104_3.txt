{probability: 0.625, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / P(witness). We know from information "a" that P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and from information "b" that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black). We also need to find P(witness), which can be calculated using the total probability law: P(witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W). Since 85% of the population is white, P(W) = 0.85. And given that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, P(witness|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (since half of the witness's errors would be identifying white people as black). Substituting these values, we get: P(witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205. Finally, P(B|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.625.}
