{probability: 0.61,
Explanation: This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)].

From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white). We also know that P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time) and P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.61. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.61.}
