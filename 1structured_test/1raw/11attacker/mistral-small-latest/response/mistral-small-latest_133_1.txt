{probability: 0.69,

The calculation is based on Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

P(B) = 0.15 (the percentage of black people in the city)
P(not B) = 0.85

The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 10% of the time (since there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample), so P(witness|not B) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|witness) as follows:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|not B) * P(not B)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85]
