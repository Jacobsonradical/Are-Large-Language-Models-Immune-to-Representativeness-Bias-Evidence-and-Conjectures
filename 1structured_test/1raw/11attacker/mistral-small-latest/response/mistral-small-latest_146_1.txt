Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We also have E, the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E).

From the data:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
