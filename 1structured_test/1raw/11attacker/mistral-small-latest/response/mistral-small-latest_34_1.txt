{probability: 0.64,
Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]
P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|witness) â‰ˆ 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.64.}
