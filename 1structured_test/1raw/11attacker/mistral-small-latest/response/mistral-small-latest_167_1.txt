{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we calculate the prior probability that the attacker is black given the population demographics (b), which is 0.15. Then we calculate the likelihood that the witness would say the attacker is black if he is indeed black, which is 0.8. We also calculate the likelihood that the witness would say the attacker is black if he is actually white, which is 0.2 (the error rate). Finally, we multiply these probabilities together and normalize to get the posterior probability, which is approximately 0.54.}
