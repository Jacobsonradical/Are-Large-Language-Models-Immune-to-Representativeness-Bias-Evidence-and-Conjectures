{probability: 0.68, based on the given information and assuming the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the actual race distribution in the city}

Explanation:
1. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W). Given information "a", P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
2. According to the witness identification ability in information "b", there is an 80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, and a 20% chance they incorrectly identify a black person as white.
3. Similarly, there is a 20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, and a 80% chance they correctly identify a white person as white.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we want to find P(B|witness says black), where P(B|witness says black) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|witness says black) = [P(witness says black|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness says black|B) * P(B) + P(witness says black|W) * P(W)]
6. P(witness says black|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person), and P(witness says black|W) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).
7. Plugging in the values, P(B|witness says black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.68

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.68.
