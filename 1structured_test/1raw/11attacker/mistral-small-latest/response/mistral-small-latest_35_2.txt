{probability: 0.72, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified him as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W), where P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15), P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (0.8, from the given data), and P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black.

P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B), where P(not B) is 0.85, and P(W|not B) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.72}
