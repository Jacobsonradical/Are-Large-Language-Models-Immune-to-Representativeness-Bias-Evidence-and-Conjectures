{probability: 0.46, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the attacker being black has a prior probability of 0.15 (from the population statistics), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.46.}
