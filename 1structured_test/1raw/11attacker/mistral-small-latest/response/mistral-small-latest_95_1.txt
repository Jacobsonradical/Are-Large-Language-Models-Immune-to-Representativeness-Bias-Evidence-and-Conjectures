{probability: 0.46, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (based on city population) is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (false positive rate). The posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.46.}
