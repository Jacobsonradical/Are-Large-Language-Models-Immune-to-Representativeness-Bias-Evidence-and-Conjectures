{probability: 0.73, The attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, the witness's accuracy in identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the witness's accuracy in identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (since there's a 20% error rate and only half the errors would be misidentifying a white person as black). So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.73.}
