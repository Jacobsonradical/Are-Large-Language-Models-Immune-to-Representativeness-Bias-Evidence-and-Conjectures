{probability: 0.64, Based on Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.64. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of a black attacker (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8), and dividing by the sum of the products of the prior probabilities and the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying them.}
