{probability: 0.525, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (given by the population distribution). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (given by the witness's accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (the witness's error rate applied to the white population). The posterior probability of the attacker being black is therefore (0.8*0.15) / ((0.8*0.15) + (0.1*0.85)) = 0.525.}
