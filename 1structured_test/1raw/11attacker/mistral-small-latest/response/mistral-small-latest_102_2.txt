{probability: 0.44, explanation: This is a classic problem of Bayesian inference. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, W as the event that the attacker is white, and E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)].

From the problem, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.
P(E|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8.
P(E|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.1 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the error rate is 20%, and half of that is misidentifying a white person as black).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.44.}
