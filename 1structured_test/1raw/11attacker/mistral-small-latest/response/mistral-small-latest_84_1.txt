{probability: 0.73, explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We know that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85 from information "a". Let's denote E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. Given information "b", we have P(E|B) = 0.8 and P(E|W) = 0.2. Now, we want to find P(B|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.73}
