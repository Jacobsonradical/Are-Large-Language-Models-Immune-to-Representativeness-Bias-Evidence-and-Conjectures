{probability: 0.7333, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.7333 or 73.33%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let B be the event that the attacker is black.
2. We know that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
3. Let W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black. Given that the attacker is black, the probability of the witness being correct is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
4. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
5. Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
6. Calculate P(W): P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
    - P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
    - P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).
    - So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.253
7. Now, P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.253 ≈ 0.7333
