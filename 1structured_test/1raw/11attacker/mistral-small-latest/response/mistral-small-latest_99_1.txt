Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote:

- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the attacker is white
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85 (from information "a").
We also know that P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, from information "b").
We can assume P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time).

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34.

Answer: {probability: 0.34}
