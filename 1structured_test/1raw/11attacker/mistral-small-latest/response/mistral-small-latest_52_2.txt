{probability: 0.76,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first consider the witness's accuracy without any other information. If the attacker's race was chosen at random, 85% of the time the attacker would be white and 15% of the time the attacker would be black. Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying race, we would expect them to correctly identify a white attacker 68% of the time (0.85 * 0.8) and a black attacker 12% of the time (0.15 * 0.8).

2. However, the witness identified the attacker as black. We need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. There's a 20% chance the witness would misidentify a white person as black, which occurs 17% of the time (0.85 * 0.2).

3. The total probability that the attacker is black, considering both the witness's correct identification and the possibility of a mistake, is 12% (correct identification) + 17% (misidentification) = 29%.

4. However, we also need to normalize this probability since there are only two possibilities for the attacker's race. So, the final probability that the attacker is black is 29 / (29 + 68) = 0.76. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.76.
