{probability: 0.69, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.8, and the likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.1 (since the sample is half white and half black, and the witness makes mistakes in 20% of the cases). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.69.}
