{probability: 0.68, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the witness is correct. We want to find P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W).

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is black is P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B). Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85.

The probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is white is P(W|not B) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 (the witness makes an error 20% of the time, and half of these errors would be identifying a white person as black).

Plugging these values into the equation, we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.4 * 0.85 = 0.52.

Finally, P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.52 â‰ˆ 0.68.}
