{probability: 0.64, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's assume B is the event that the attacker is black, and W is the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

First, we know from the data that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

Then, we know from the witness's performance that P(witness|B) = 0.8 and P(witness|W) = 0.2.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|witness):

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.64}
