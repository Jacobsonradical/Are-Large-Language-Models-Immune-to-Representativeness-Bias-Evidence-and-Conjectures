{probability: 0.615,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability and can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the given information, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white). The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(witness|W) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.615

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.615.}
