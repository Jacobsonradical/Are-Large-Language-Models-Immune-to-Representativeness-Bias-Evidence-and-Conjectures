{probability: 0.636, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement can be calculated. The prior probability of a random person being black is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.8*0.15) / ((0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)) = 0.636.}
