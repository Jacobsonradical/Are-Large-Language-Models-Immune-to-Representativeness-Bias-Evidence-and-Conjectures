{probability: 0.75,

Explanation:

1. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B and the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as W.
2. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W).
4. P(B), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 based on the population distribution.
5. P(W|B), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
6. To find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B).
7. P(not B) is 0.85, the probability that the attacker is not black.
8. P(W|not B) is 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white.
9. Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22.
10. Finally, we can calculate P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.75.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.75.}
