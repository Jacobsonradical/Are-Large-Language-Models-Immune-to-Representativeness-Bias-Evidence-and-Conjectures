{probability: 0.636,
Explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can assume that they are 80% likely to correctly identify a black person as black. Thus, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8.

However, we also need to account for the fact that there might be a white attacker. Since 85% of the population is white, the prior probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. Even though the witness incorrectly identifies race in 20% of cases, this error rate applies to both races. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such is:

(Probability of witness correctly identifying a black attacker) * (Prior probability of attacker being black) + (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.636}
