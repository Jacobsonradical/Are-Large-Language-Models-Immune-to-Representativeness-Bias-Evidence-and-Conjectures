{probability: 0.89, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is calculated as follows: P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]. Here, B is the event that the attacker is black, W is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(B) = 0.15, P(not B) = 0.85, P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness is correct when the attacker is black), and P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error when the attacker is not black). Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.89.}
