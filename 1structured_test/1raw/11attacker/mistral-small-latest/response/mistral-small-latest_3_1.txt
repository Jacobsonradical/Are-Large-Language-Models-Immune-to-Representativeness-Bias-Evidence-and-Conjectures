{probability: 0.784, Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time under similar conditions, and the actual probability of a black attacker is 15% due to the population demographics, the probability of the attacker being black can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The resulting probability is approximately 0.784 or 78.4%.}
