{probability: 0.89,

This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote our events as follows:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We know the prior probability P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

We also know the conditional probability P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. This can be calculated using the total probability law:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85. We also know that when the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, substituting P(B) and the other known values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.89

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.89.}
