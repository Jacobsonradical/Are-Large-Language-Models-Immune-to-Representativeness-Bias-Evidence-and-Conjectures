Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:

B: The event that the attacker is black
W: The event that the attacker is white
T: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(T|B) = 0.8 (80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(T|W) = 0.2 (20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(B|T) = [P(T|B) * P(B)] / [P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|T) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives approximately 0.45 or 45%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.45}.
