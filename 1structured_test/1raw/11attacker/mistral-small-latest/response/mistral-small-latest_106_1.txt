{probability: 0.88, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.88. The calculation is as follows:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (population distribution in the city)
P(witness says black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] + [P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]
P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black)
P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (population distribution in the city)

P(witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.22

So, P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.88}
