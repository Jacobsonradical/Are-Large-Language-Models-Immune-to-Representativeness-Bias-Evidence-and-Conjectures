{probability: 0.6667, or approximately 66.67%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let's assume that the witness is equally likely to encounter a white or black person in the city due to the population distribution (85% white, 15% black).
2. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person and a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a white person as black.
3. Given the population distribution, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
5. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both scenarios: the witness correctly identified a black person or incorrectly identified a white person.
6. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these probabilities: 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.6667 or approximately 66.67%.
