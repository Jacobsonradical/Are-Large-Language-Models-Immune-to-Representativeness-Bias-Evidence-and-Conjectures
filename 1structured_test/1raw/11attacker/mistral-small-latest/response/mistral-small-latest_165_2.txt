Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know that:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3. To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is black and where the attacker is white.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is white as P(W), which is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

P(B|W) represents the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases, and in this case, the error would be to identify a white person as black, P(B|W) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.52

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.52.
