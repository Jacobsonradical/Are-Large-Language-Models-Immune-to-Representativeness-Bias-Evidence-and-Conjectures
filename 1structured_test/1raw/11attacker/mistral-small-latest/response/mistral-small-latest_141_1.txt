{probability: 0.69, This is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (b). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (a). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time). Using Bayes' theorem, we get 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2), which is approximately 0.69.}
