{probability: 0.43, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's assume that there is an equal chance of the attacker being white or black, since we don't have any other information.
2. Given the witness's accuracy rate, if the attacker is black, there is an 80% chance that the witness will identify them correctly.
3. However, if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as black.
4. Since 85% of the population is white, it's more likely that the attacker is white. So, we need to take that into account.
5. The probability of the witness identifying a white attacker as black is 0.15 (85% of 20% error rate).
6. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.15 (15% of the population) * 0.8 (80% accuracy rate).
7. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.15) = 0.43 (rounded to two decimal places).
