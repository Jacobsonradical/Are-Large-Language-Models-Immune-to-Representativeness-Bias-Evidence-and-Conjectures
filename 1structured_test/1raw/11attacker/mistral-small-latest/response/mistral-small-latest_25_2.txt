{probability: 0.54, Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.54.}

Explanation:
This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they also make errors 20% of the time. So, P(W|not B) = 0.2.
P(not B) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city)

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

Finally, substituting P(W) into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.54
