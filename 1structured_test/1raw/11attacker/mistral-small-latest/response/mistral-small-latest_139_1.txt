{probability: 0.778,

This is a Bayesian probability question. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, so P(B) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.

P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness correctly identifies race in 80% of cases, they incorrectly identify race in 20% of cases. So, P(W|not B) = 0.2.

P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.778 (rounded to three decimal places).
