{probability: 0.88, explanation: Given that the attacker is either white or black with probabilities 0.85 and 0.15, respectively, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white, P(T|B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, and P(T|W) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white. We can calculate P(T|B) = 0.8 and P(T|W) = 0.2. Bayes' theorem gives us P(B|T) = P(T|B) * P(B) / [P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)]. Plugging in the numbers, we get P(B|T) â‰ˆ 0.88.}
