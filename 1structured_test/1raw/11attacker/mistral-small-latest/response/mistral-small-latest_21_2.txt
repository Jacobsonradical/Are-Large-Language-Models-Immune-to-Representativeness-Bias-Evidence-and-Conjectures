{probability: 0.84, The probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the attacker is white. We know that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. Let's also denote E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are given that P(E|B) = 0.8 and P(E|W) = 0.2. We want to find P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B)P(B) / [P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W)]. Plugging in the values, we get P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.84.}
