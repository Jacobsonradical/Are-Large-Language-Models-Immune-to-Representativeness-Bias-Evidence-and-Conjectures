{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the attacker's race is a random variable, with a prior probability of 0.85 for being white and 0.15 for being black, based on the demographics of the city.
2. The witness's testimony can be considered as evidence. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.10 (20% error rate on half of the sample).
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:
   P(Black|Testimony) = [P(Testimony|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Testimony|Black) * P(Black) + P(Testimony|White) * P(White)]
4. Plugging in the values:
   P(Black|Testimony) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.
