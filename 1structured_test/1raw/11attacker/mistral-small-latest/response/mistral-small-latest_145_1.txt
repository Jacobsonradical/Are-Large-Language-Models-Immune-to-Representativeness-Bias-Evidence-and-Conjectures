{probability: 0.47, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (P(B)) that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood (P(W|B)) that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that they are black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that they are white is 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such is (0.15*0.8) / ((0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2)) = 0.47.}
