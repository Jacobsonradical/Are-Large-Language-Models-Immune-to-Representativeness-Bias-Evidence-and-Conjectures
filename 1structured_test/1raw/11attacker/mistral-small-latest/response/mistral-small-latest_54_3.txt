{probability: 0.44, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let T be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|T), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|T) = [P(T|B) * P(B)] / [P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)].

From the information provided, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. The probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time), so P(T|B) = 0.8. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases), so P(T|W) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get P(B|T) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.44.}
