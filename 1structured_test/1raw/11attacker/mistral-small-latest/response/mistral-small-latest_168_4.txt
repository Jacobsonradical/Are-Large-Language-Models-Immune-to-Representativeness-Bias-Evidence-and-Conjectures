{probability: 0.72, Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We are looking for the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), which can be calculated as P(B) * P(W|B) / P(W). P(B) is given as 0.15 (15% of the population is black). P(W|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is given as 0.8 (80% of the time). P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which can be calculated as P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B), where P(not B) is 0.85 and P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20% of the time). Calculating P(W) gives us 0.252. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives us P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.72.}
