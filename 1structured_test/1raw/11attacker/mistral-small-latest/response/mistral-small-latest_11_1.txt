{probability: 0.64, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:
1. Prior probability (P(B)): Given that 15% of the population is black, P(B) = 0.15.
2. Probability of evidence given the attacker is black (P(W|B)): The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.
3. Probability of evidence given the attacker is white (P(W|not B)): The witness correctly identifies a white person half of the time since there are equal numbers of whites and blacks in the sample. So P(W|not B) = 0.5.
4. Prior probability of the attacker being white (P(not B)): Given that 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black: P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.64.}
