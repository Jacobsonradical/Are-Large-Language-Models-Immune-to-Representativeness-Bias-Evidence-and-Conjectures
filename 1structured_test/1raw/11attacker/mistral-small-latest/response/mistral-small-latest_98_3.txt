{probability: 0.67, based on Bayes' theorem, the prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15% of the population), the likelihood that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy), and the likelihood that the witness would identify a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places).}
