{probability: 0.55, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (given by information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (given by information a). Therefore, the posterior probability, or the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.55.}
