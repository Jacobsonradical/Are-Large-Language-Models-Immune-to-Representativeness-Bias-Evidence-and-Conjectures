{probability: 0.44,

Explanation: This is a probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the attacker is white. We are given P(B)=0.15 (from b), P(correct identification|B) = 0.8 (from a), and P(correct identification|W) = 0.2 (from a). We want to find P(B|correct identification).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|correct identification) = [P(correct identification|B) * P(B)] / [P(correct identification|B) * P(B) + P(correct identification|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the given probabilities, we get:

P(B|correct identification) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.44

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.44.}
