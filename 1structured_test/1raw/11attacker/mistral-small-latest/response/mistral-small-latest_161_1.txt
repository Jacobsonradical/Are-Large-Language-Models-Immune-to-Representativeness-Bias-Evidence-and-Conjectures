{probability: 0.852,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the race. We want to find P(B|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W), where P(W|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the race of the attacker.

From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time), and P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time).

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B), where P(not B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.852.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.852, or 85.2%.
