{probability: 0.86, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the witness's accuracy rate, the prior probability of a black attacker due to the city demographics, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black, the posterior probability of the attacker being black is approximately 0.86.}
