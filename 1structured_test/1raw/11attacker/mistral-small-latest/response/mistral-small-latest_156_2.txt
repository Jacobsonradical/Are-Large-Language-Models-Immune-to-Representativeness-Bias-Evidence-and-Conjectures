{probability: 0.59, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) is 0.15 that the attacker is black. The likelihood (a) is 0.8 that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. So, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.59.}
