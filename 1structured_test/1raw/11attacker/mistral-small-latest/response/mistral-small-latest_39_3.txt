{probability: 0.78, explanation: We can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Prior probability: P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Likelihood: The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8. The witness may also incorrectly identify a white person as black, so P(witness|W) = 0.1 (20% error rate when the person is actually white).

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values: P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.78 or 78%.}
