{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as black, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness's identification is correct. Given the population distribution, there is a 0.15 probability that a random person in the city is black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(black|identified as black) = [P(identified as black|black) * P(black)] / P(identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.64}
