{probability: 0.84, The probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability (85% white and 15% black in the city), and the witness's accuracy rate (80% correct in identifying race under similar conditions), the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.84 or 84%.}
