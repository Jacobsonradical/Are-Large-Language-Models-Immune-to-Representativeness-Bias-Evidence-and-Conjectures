{probability: 0.72, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We are given that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E).

We know P(B) = 0.15. P(E|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is given as 0.8 (80%).

P(E|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%) times the proportion of white people, so P(E|W) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.233.

So, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.233 â‰ˆ 0.72.}
