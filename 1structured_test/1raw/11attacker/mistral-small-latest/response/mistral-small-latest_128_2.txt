{probability: 0.76, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We know P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85 from information a. Let E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We know P(E|B) = 0.8 and P(E|W) = 0.2 from information b. We want to find P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]. Plugging in the values, P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.76.}
