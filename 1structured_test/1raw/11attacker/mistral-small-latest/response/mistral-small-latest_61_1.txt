{probability: 0.46, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the city's demographics, is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness would identify a black person as black is 0.8. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)], which is approximately 0.46.}
