Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E)

From the information:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person is black)
P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is white)

P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

So, P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.545.

Answer: {probability: 0.545}
