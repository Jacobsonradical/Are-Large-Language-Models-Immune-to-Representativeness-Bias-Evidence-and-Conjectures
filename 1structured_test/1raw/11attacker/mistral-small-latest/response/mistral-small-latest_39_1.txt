{probability: 0.78, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Given information "a":
P(B) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black)
P(not B) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is not black)

Given information "b":
P(W|B) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(not W|B) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as not black)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)
P(not W|not B) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a non-black person as not black)

Now we need to find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.78}
