{probability: 0.68, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of a random person being black in the city is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (the 20% error rate). So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.68.}
