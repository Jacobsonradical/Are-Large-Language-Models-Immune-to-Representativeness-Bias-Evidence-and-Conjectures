Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
B = the event that the attacker is black
W = the event that the attacker is white
P(B) = prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (from information b)
P(W) = prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (from information b)
P(E|B) = probability of witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from information a)
P(E|W) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.1 (from information a, as the witness makes errors in 20% of cases and half of those are incorrectly identifying white people as black)
E = the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|E) = P(E|B)P(B) / [P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)] = 0.52 or 52%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.52.
