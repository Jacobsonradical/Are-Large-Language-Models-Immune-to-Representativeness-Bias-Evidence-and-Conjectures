{probability: 0.78, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black without considering the witness's testimony. This is 0.15. However, the witness identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness is correct in this instance is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. To account for the possibility that the attacker is indeed black but the witness mistakenly identified him as white, we also need to consider the 15% of the population that is black and the 20% error rate. This gives us a probability of 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15. However, this is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker or made an error about a white attacker. Since there are more white people in the population, we need to normalize this probability with respect to the total population. So, the final estimate is 0.15 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.78.}
