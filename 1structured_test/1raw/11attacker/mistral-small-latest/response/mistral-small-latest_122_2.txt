{probability: 0.73, The estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability that a correct identification is of a black person. This is 15% (black population) * 80% (correct identification) = 0.12. The total probability of a correct identification is 0.8 (overall accuracy) * 0.85 (white population) + 0.12 (correct black identification) = 0.704. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the correct identification, is 0.12 / 0.704 = approximately 0.73 or 73%.}
