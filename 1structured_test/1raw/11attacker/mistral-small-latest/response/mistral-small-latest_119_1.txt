{probability: 0.845, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate). So, the calculation would be: (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.845}
