{probability: 0.5625}

This is a classic problem of conditional probability, often referred to as the "Problem of the Two Doors and a Guard."

Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the information provided:

1. P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
2. P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black)
3. P(witness|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
4. P(W) = 0.85 (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is white)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.5625

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.5625.
