{probability: 0.72, explanation: This is a probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80%). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get a probability of approximately 0.72 that the attacker is black.}
