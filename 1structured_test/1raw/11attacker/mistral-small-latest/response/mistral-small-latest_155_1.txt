{probability: 0.84}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the witness is equally likely to encounter a white or black person in the city (85% white, 15% black). This is our prior probability.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time.
3. We can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as follows: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (80% of the time correct for 15% of the population).
4. Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate for 85% of the population).
5. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct (0.12) divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct about a black person and making an error about a white person (0.12 + 0.17).
6. So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.84.
