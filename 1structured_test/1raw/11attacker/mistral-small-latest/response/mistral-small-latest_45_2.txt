{probability: 0.72, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the city's population demographics, is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness would identify a black attacker correctly is 0.8 (80%). The probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is black is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. The probability that the witness is incorrect given that the attacker is white is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.72.}
