{probability: 0.74}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We start with the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15, based on the population distribution in the city.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time. Given that the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is 0.80.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
   P(black | witness says black) = [P(black) * P(witness says black | black)] / P(witness says black)
4. To calculate P(witness says black), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the race, as well as the attacker being white and the witness making a mistake.
   P(witness says black) = P(black) * P(witness says black | black) + P(white) * P(witness says black | white)
5. Since the population is 85% white, P(white) = 0.85. Also, given that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(witness says black | white) = 0.20.
6. Plugging in the values, we get:
   P(black | witness says black) = [0.15 * 0.80] / [0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20] â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.74.
