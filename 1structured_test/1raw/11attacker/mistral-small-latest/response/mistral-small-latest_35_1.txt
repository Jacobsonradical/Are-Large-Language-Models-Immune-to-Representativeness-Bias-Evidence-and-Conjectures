{probability: 0.84, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. We can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we get: P(Black|Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black|Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness says Black). We know from the information that P(Black) = 0.15 (15% of the population). P(Witness says Black|Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time). P(Witness says Black) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness saying black given that the person is black and the witness saying black given that the person is white: P(Witness says Black) = P(Witness says Black|Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness says Black|White) * P(White). We know P(White) = 0.85, and P(Witness says Black|White) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time). Therefore, P(Witness says Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get P(Black|Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.84.}
