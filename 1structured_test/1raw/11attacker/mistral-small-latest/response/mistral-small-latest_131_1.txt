{probability: 0.73, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability. The witness correctly identified the race in 80% of cases. However, only 15% of the population is black, so there's a 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 probability that the witness correctly identified a black person. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, this is the probability that the witness identified a black person, not that the attacker was actually black. To get this, we can divide the probability of the witness being correct (0.12) by the total probability of the witness identifying a black person (0.29). This gives us a probability of approximately 0.73 that the attacker is black.}
