{probability: 0.69, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 due to the population demographics. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate on the half of the sample that is white). So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.69.}
