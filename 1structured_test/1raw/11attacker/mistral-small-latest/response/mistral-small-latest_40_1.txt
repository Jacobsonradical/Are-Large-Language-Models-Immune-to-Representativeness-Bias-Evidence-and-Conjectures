{probability: 0.704, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W). Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W). We know from the problem that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black). From the witness's performance, we have P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time). To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B). Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.85. Assuming the witness has the same error rate for white people, P(W|not B) = 0.2. Plugging these values into the equation for P(W), we get P(W) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.23. Finally, we can find P(B|W) by dividing P(W|B) * P(B) by P(W): 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.704.}
