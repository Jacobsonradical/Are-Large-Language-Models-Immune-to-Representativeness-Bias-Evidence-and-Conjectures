{probability: 0.54,

Explanation: This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

From the information given:
P(witness correctly identifies B) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(witness makes mistake on W) = 0.2 (probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black)
P(B) = 0.15 (probability that a randomly selected person from the city is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (probability that a randomly selected person from the city is white)

Now, we can calculate the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem:
P(witness|B) = P(witness correctly identifies B) = 0.8
P(witness|W) = P(witness makes mistake on W) = 0.2

Plugging in the values:
P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.54

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.54.}
