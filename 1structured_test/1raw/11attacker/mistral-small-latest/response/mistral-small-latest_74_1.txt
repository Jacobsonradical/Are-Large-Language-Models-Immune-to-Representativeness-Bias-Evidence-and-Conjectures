{probability: 0.875}

This is a Bayesian probability problem. We are trying to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know from the problem statement that P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The problem also states that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when given a sample of people, half white and half black. So, P(W|B) = 0.8.

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(W|not B) = 0.2. We also know that P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.875.
