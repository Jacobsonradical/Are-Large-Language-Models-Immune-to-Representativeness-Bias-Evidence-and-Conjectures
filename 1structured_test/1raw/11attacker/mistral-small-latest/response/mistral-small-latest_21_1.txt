{probability: 0.68, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification can be calculated as follows: P(Black|Identified as Black) = [P(Identified as Black|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Identified as Black|Black) * P(Black) + P(Identified as Black|White) * P(White)]. Given that P(Black) = 0.15, P(White) = 0.85, P(Identified as Black|Black) = 0.8, and P(Identified as Black|White) = 0.2, the probability is approximately 0.68.}
