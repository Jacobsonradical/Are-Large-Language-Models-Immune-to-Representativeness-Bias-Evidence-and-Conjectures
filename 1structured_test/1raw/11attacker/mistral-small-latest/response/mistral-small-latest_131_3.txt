{probability: 0.54, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification can be calculated as follows: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]. Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We know P(A) = 0.15, P(not A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases). So, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.54.}
