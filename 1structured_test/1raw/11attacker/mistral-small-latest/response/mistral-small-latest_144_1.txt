{probability: 0.74, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability question. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. Given the population distribution, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. The witness correctly identified a black person as black with probability 0.8 (since they erred in 20% of cases), so P(witness says black | B) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identified a white person as black with probability 0.1 (since they erred in 20% of cases), so P(witness says black | W) = 0.1. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B | witness says black) = P(witness says black | B) * P(B) / P(witness says black). P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | B) * P(B) + P(witness says black | W) * P(W) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.1 = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205. So, P(B | witness says black) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.74.}
