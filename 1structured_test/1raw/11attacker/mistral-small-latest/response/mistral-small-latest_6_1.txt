{probability: 0.58, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability, based on the city's demographics, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate), and the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Multiplying these together and adjusting for the total likelihood gives an estimated probability of 0.58 that the attacker is black.}
