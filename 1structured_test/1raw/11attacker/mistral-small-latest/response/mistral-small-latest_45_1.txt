{probability: 0.66, explanation: This is a classic problem of Bayesian probability. Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black, and W as the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) * P(B) / (P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)).

We know from the problem that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85. We also know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, so P(witness|B) = 0.8.

However, we need to find P(witness|W), the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Given the witness's overall error rate of 20%, and assuming the errors are equally distributed between white and black misidentifications, P(witness|W) = 0.1 (10% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)) = 0.66. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.66.}
