{probability: 0.765,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability and can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the attacker is white. We want to find P(B|witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

We are given:
- P(witness|B) = 0.8 (probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
- P(witness|W) = 0.2 (probability that the witness identifies a white person as black)
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|witness) = [P(witness|B) * P(B)] / [P(witness|B) * P(B) + P(witness|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values: P(B|witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.765}
