{probability: 0.65, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.1 (20% error rate out of the 50% white sample). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.65.}
