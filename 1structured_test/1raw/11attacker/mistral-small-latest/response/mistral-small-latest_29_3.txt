{probability: 0.739,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Let's denote the event that the attacker is black as B and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black as W. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W).

From the information given in "a", P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

From the information given in "b", P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B).

From the information given in "a", P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

From the information given in "b", P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, substituting into Bayes' theorem, we get P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.739.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.739.
