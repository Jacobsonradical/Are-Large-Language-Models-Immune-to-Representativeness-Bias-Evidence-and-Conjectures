To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief with new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population demographics (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness's identification (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

Let's denote:
B as the event that the attacker is black
W as the event that the attacker is white
E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We have:
P(B) = 0.15 (probability that a random person is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (probability that a random person is white)

The witness's accuracy is given as:
P(E|B) = 0.80 (probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(E|W) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|E) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating the values:

P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
