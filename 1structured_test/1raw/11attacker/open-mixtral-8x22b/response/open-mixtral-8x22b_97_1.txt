To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (updated probability based on evidence) is proportional to the likelihood (probability of evidence given the hypothesis) times the prior probability (initial probability of the hypothesis).

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

We know that P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black).

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating:
P(B|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
