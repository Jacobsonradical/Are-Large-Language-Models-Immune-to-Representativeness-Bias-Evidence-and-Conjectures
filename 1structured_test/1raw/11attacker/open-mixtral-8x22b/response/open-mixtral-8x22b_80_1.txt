To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black as P(B|A), and the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black as P(B).

According to the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which is 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

Since 85% of the population is white, P(A') = 0.85, where A' is the event "the attacker is white".

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
