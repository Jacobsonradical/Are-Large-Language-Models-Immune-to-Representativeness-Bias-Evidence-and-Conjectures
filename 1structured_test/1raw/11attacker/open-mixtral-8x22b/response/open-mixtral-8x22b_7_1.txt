To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used when we want to update our prior beliefs based on some observed data. Here, our prior belief is the distribution of races in the city, and our observed data is the witness identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B). This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black. This is 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. This is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, either correctly or incorrectly. This can be calculated by considering both the true positive rate (when the witness correctly identifies a black person) and the false positive rate (when the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black (in this case, white). This is 20%.
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.3966

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.3966 or 39.66%.
