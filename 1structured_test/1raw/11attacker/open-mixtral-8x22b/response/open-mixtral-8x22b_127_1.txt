To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to the information provided:
- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are indeed black, is 0.8 (80% of the time).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are not black (i.e., they are white), is 0.2 (20% of the time).
- P(~A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., they are white), is 0.85 (85% of the population).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.
