To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities from the problem:
- P(A): The probability that any person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(A'): The probability that any person in the city is not black (i.e., white), which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|A'): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time) or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (P(A|B)) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3478

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3478.

In the requested dictionary format:
{
  "probability": 0.3478,
  "explanation": "The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.3478."
