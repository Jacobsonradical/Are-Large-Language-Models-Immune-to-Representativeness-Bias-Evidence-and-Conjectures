To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's define:
H: The attacker is black
E: The witness identified the attacker as black
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black
P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
P(E|~H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

From the information given, we have:
P(H) = 0.15 (The population is 15% black)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, mistaking a non-black person for black)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.41

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
