To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our initial belief is the racial composition of the city, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

First, let's calculate P(B), the prior probability that the attacker is black:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

Next, let's calculate P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

Now let's calculate P(W|~B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black (i.e., they are white):
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate P(~B), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (white):
P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.41.
