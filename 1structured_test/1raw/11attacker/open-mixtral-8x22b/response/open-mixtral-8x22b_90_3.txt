To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black". We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So we have:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.23

And thus:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.23 = 0.52

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.52 (52%).

So the final answer is: {probability: 0.52}
