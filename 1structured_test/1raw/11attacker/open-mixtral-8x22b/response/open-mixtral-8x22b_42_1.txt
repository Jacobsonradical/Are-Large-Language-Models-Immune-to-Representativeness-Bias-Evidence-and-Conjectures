To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is black = 0.80
P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black = 0.20

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substitute the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculate the values:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
