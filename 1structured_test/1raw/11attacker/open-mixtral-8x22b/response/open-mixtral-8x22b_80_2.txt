To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (in this case, the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (in this case, the probability of an individual being black in the city)
- P(B) is the probability of B (in this case, the probability that the witness identifies someone as black regardless of their actual race)

Let's plug in the numbers from the problem into the formula:

P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is black, and the witness is correct (with probability P(B|A) * P(A)) and the attacker is white, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as black (with probability P(B|not A) * P(not A)). Given that 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85. We are told that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
