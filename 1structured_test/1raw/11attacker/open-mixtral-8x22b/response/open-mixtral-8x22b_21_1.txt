To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful for updating our beliefs after considering new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- Event A as "the witness identified the attacker as black"
- Event B as "the attacker is actually black"
- Event B' as "the attacker is actually white"

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population)
- P(B') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is the same as the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(A|B') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness misidentifies a white person as black, which is the same as the witness's error rate in identifying white people)

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(B|A) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
