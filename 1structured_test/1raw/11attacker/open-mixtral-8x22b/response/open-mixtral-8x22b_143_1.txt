To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)
- P(I|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(I|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substitute the given probabilities:
P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
