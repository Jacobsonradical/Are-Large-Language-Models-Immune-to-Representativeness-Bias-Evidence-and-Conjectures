To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

In this case, let's denote:

- H: The attacker is black.
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, let's calculate P(E|H), which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information provided, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time:

P(E|H) = 0.80

Now, we need to calculate P(E), which is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race. To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Where P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that the individual is not black (i.e., white), and P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is white.

From the information provided, the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. However, since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is higher than incorrectly identifying a black person as white. Therefore, we can approximate P(E|~H) as follows:

P(E|~H) = 0.20 * (0.85 / 0.15) ≈ 1.13

This approximation assumes that the witness's errors are uniformly distributed across both races. However, this is not strictly accurate, as the witness's errors could be biased towards one race or the other. Nevertheless, we'll use this approximation for the sake of simplicity.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 1.13 * 0.85
     ≈ 0.12 + 0.96
     ≈ 1.08

Note that the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H) exceeds 1, which is not possible in a strict probabilistic sense. However, this reflects the approximation we made earlier.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
       = 0.80 * 0.15 / 1.08
       ≈ 0.111

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.111 or 11.1%.
