To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the process of updating beliefs based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- B: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the attacker is white.
- E: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
