To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimates when new information is introduced. In this case, the new information is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's break it down:

1. We know that 15% of the population is black. This is our prior probability, P(Black), before considering the witness's statement.
2. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying the race.
3. We want to find the posterior probability, P(Black|Witness), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Black|Witness) = P(Witness|Black) * P(Black) / P(Witness)

P(Witness|Black) is the probability of the witness identifying the person as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 80%.

P(Black) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15%.

P(Witness) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This can be calculated by considering both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

P(Witness) = P(Witness|Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness|White) * P(White)

P(Witness|White) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 20%.

P(White) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85%.

Now, let's calculate:

P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we calculate the posterior probability:

P(Black|Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.
