To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that helps us update our beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the city's population demographic.
- P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%).
- P(I|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(I|W) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are actually white, which is 0.2 (20%) because the witness made errors in 20% of the cases.

We are interested in finding the posterior probability, P(B|I), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B|I) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
