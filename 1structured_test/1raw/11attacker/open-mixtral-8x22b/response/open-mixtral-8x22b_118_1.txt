To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A as "The attacker is black"
- Event B as "The witness identified the attacker as black"

Given the information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (The probability that a random person in the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know that P(~A), the probability that a random person in the city is not black, is 0.85. We also know that P(B|~A), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, is 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4348

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4348 or 43.48%.
