To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. In this case, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)

To find P(W), we need to consider the probabilities that the witness identifies both black and white people as black:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W') * P(W')

Where:
- P(W') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(W|W') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now we can compute the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.23

Finally, we can compute the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.5217

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5217, or 52.17%.
