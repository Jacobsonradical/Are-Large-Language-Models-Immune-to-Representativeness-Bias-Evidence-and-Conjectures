To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We know the following probabilities from the given information:

P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15
P(not A): The prior probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85
P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is actually black = 0.80
P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black = 0.20

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black, P(A|B), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
