To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:

- P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(W|~B) = 0.20 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases when the person is not black)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.4118

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4118.
