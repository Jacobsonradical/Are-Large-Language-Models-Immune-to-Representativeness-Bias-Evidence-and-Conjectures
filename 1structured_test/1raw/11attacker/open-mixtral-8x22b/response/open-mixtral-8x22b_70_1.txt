To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A and divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

The probability of event A (P(A)) is given as 15% or 0.15.
The probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) is given as 80% or 0.8, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
The probability of event B (P(B)), however, needs to be calculated based on the given information. It is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, whether they are actually black or not.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
Where P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (20%) and P(~A) is the probability that the person is not black (85%).

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here is the answer in the requested dictionary format:
{probability: 0.41}
