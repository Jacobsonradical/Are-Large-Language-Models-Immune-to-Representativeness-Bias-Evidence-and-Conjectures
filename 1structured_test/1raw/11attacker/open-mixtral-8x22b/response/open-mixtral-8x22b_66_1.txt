To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial probability estimate (prior probability) with new evidence (likelihood) to get a new and improved estimate (posterior probability).

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability that the attacker is black (P(B)) is given as 15%. Conversely, the prior probability that the attacker is white (P(W)) is 85%.

According to the information provided:
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is 80%)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 20%)

Bayes' theorem for calculating the posterior probability that the attacker is black (P(B|I)) is:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.46 or 46%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 46%.
