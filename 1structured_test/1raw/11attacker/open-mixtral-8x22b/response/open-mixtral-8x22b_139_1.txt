To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the racial demographics of the city, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, i.e., the error rate)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.424

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.424 or 42.4%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
