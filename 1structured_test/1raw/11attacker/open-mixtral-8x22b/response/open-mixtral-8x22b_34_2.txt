To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial composition of the city.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black.
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)

To find P(B|W), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

We know P(W|B) and P(B), but we also need to know P(W|not B) and P(not B).

- P(not B) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).
- P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black, which is the error rate of the witness, 0.20.

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

P(B|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.4667.
