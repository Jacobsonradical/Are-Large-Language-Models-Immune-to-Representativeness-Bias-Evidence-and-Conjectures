To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. In this case, let's denote:

- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in finding P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

We have the following probabilities:

- P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. From the information given, this is 80%.
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black).
- P(E): The overall probability of the witness identifying a person as black, regardless of their actual race. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We know that P(E|H) is 80% (0.8), P(H) is 15% (0.15), and P(not H) is 85% (0.85). To find P(E|not H), we need the probability of the witness falsely identifying a white person as black. Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, and half of the sample is white, the probability of the witness falsely identifying a white person as black is 10% (0.1).

Now, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205] â‰ˆ 0.585

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.585.
