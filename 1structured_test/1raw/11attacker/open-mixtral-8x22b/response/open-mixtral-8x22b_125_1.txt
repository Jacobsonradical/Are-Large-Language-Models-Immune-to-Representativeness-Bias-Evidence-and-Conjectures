To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black
- P(E|~H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

From the information provided:
- P(H) = 0.15 (Since 15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so 20% of the time a non-black person will be identified as black)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E), which is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Where ~H is the event that the attacker is not black, and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (Since 85% of the population is white).

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4193548387

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.419 (rounded to three decimal places).
