Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

First, let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the attacker is white,
- C as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the problem, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black),
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white),
- P(C|B) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black),
- P(C|W) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black).

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black is:

P(B|C) = P(C|B) \* P(B) / [P(C|B) \* P(B) + P(C|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the value:

P(B|C) â‰ˆ 0.514

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.514.
