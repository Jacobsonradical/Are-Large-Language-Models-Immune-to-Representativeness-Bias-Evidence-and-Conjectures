To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior knowledge with new evidence to get a posterior probability.

First, let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the demographic information.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We know that P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85, so:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now, let's calculate the value:

P(B|W) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, given the witness's identification and the demographic information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
