To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

From the given information, we have:

- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is white)
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(B|I) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|I) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.41

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41. Here is the dictionary format:

{probability: 0.41}
