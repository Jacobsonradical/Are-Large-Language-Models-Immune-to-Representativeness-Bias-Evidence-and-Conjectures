To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (from b)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (from a)
- P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2 (since the witness is equally likely to misidentify the attacker's race)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
