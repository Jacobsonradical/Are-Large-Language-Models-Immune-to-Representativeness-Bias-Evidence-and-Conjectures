To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the information given about the demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race.

1. The base rate probability of the attacker being black is 15%, given that 15% of the city's population is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.

To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness says black)

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = 0.12 / 0.23

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) â‰ˆ 0.5217

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5217.
