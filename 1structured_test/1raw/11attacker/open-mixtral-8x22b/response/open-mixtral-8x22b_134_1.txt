To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial distribution of the city's population, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15).
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (0.80).
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (0.20).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|W) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Now, let's calculate the value:
P(B|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41379

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41379 or 41.379%.
