To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge related to the event. In this case, the prior knowledge is the witness's ability to identify the race of a person and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- IB as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- IW as the event that the witness identified the attacker as white.

From the given information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)
- P(IB|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(IW|W) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white)
- P(IW|B) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white)
- P(IB|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|IB), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|IB) = P(IB|B) * P(B) / [P(IB|B) * P(B) + P(IB|W) * P(W)]

Now, let's calculate P(B|IB):

P(B|IB) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(B|IB) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|IB) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|IB) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
