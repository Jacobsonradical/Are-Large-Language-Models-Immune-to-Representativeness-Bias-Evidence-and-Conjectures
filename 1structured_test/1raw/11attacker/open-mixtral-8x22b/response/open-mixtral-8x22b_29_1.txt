To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event A given event B is equal to the prior probability of A multiplied by the likelihood of B given A, divided by the prior probability of B.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

The prior probability of A (P(A)), which is the probability that the attacker is black without any additional information, is given by the population demographics, which is 15%.

The likelihood of B given A (P(B|A)), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black, is 80% according to the witness's accuracy rate.

The prior probability of B (P(B)), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black without any additional information, can be calculated by considering both the probability that the attacker is black and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8) and the probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes an error (0.85 * 0.2).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of A given B (P(A|B)), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41379310344827586

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

  "probability": 0.414
