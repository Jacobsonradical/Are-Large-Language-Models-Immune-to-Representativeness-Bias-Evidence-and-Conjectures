To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimates when we have new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's race.

Let's denote:
- B as "the attacker is black"
- W as "the witness identifies the attacker as black"

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We have the following information:
- P(B), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (from information b)
- P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, is 0.8 (from information a)
- P(W), the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black, can be calculated by conditioning on the attacker's race:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases when identifying a white person)

Now we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.3103

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.3103.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
{probability: 0.3103}
