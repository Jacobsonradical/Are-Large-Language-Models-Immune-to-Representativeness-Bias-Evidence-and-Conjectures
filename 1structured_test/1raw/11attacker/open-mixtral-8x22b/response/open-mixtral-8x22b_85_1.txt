To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that helps us update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Let's denote:
B: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the attacker is white
E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population distribution)
P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
P(E|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(E|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:
P(B|E) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating the above expression, we get:
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 35.7%.

Here's the dictionary format:
