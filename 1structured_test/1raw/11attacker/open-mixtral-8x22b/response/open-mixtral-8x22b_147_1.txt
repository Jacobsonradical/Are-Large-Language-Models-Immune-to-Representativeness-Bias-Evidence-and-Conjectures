To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) and P(WB) as the prior probabilities of B and W given B, respectively.

From the information provided:
- P(B) = 0.15 (The probability that a random individual is black)
- P(WB) = 0.80 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black individual)
- P(WB') = 0.20 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black individual as black)

We want to calculate the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(WB) * P(B) / [P(WB) * P(B) + P(WB') * P(B')]

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black:
- P(B') = 0.85 (The probability that a random individual is not black)

Now, plug the values into the formula:

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4348

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4348 or 43.48%.

Here's the final answer in the requested format:
