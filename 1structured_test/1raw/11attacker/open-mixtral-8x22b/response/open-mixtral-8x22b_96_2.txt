To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

In this case, the hypotheses are:
H1: The attacker is black.
H2: The attacker is white.

The evidence (E) is: "A witness identified the attacker as black."

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities of the hypotheses:
P(H1) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(H2) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods of the evidence given each hypothesis:
P(E|H1) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(E|H2) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:
P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)]
P(H1|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.47

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.47.
