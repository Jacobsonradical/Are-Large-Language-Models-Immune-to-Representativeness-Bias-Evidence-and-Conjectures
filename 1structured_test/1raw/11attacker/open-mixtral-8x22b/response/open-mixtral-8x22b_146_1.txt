To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, times the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. So, we want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.47.
