To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or evidence related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 according to the population demographics
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 according to the witness's accuracy
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white), which is 0.2 according to the witness's error rate

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(B|W) is given by:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) \* P(B)] / [P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the probability:

P(B|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the population demographics is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the final answer in the requested dictionary format:
