To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A) given the witness's testimony (W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know the following:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the racial composition of the city)

To find P(W), we need to consider both the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (P(W|A) * P(A)) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (P(W|~A) * P(~A)):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

We know that P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black) and P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white, given the racial composition of the city).

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41379310344827586

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
