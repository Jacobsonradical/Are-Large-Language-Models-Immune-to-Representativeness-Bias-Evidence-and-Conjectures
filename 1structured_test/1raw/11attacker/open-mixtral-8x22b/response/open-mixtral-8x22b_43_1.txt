To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, all divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black)

We can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Let's compute the values:
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
