To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that describes the process of refining the probabilities of hypotheses as more evidence becomes available.

In this case, the hypotheses are:
H1: The attacker is black.
H2: The attacker is white.

The evidence is the witness identification.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities based on the racial composition of the city:
P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(H2) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Next, we'll compute the likelihoods based on the witness's accuracy:
P(E|H1) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(E|H2) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:
P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)]
P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.341 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.341 or 34.1%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
{
  "probability": 0.341,
  "answer": "The estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.341 or 34.1%."
