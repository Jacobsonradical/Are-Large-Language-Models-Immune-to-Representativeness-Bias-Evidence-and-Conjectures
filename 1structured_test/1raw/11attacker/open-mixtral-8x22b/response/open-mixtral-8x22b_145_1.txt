To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We have the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial composition of the city)
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|~A)P(~A) (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race)

We also know that:

P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white, based on the racial composition of the city)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|~A)P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
