To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|I), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives:

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.419

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.419.
