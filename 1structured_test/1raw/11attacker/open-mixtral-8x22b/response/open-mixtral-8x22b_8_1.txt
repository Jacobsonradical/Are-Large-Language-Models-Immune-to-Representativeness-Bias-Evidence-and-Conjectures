Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given that:
- P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black, is 15% or 0.15, based on the racial demographics of the city.

We also need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, regardless of their actual race. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate this as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2. And P(not A), the prior probability of the attacker being white, is 85% or 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379.

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41379.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
