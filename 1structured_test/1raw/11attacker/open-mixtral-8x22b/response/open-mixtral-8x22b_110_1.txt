To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(B|W) is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

From the information given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
