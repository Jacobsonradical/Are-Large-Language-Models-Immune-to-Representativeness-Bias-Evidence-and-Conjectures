To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is equal to the prior probability of the event times the likelihood of the observed evidence given that event, divided by the prior probability of the observed evidence.

In this case, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- ~A as the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).
- B as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15, the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(~A) = 0.85, the prior probability that the attacker is not black (white).
- P(B|A) = 0.80, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(B|~A) = 0.20, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.
