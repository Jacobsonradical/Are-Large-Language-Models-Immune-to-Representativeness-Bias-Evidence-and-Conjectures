To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker is black
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population demographics
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which is 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy
- P(E|not H): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), which is 0.20 based on the witness's error rate
- P(not H): the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 based on the population demographics

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.387 or 38.7%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 38.7%.

Here's the answer in the required format:
