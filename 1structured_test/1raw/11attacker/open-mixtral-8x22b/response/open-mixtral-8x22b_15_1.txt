To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update probabilities based on the observation of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- I as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:
P(B|I) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
