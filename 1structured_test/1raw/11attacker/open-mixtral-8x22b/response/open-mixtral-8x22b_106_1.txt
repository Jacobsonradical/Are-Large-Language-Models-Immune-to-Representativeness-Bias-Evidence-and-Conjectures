To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / (P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W))

Now, let's plug in the given values:

P(B|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.4118

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4118.
