To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in statistics that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

Let B represent the event that the attacker is black, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(W|B) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black)
P(B) = 0.15 (The probability that a random person is black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (The probability that a random person is not black)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After performing the calculations, we get:
P(B|W) = 0.43478 (rounded to five decimal places)

This is the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the information provided.

Answer: {probability: 0.43478}
