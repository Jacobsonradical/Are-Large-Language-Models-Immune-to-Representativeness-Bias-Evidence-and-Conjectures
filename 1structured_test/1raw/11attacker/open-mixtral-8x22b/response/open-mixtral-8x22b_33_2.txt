To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used when we want to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- Hypothesis H: The attacker is black.
- Evidence E: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)

We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. So, given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness will mistakenly identify a person as black is:
- P(E|~H) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 17% of the time)

The total probability of the evidence P(E) is the sum of the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the probability of the evidence given not the hypothesis:
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us approximately:
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.39

So, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.39.
