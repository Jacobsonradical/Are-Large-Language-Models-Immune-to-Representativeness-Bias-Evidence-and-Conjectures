To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15.
- P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are indeed black, which is 0.80.
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are not black, which is 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
