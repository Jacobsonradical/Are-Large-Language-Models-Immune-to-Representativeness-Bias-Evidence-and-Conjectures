To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, all divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
A = Attacker is black
B = Witness identified the attacker as black

From the information given, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is an error)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white), so we can substitute these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.462

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.462 or 46.2%.

Here's the result in the requested format:
