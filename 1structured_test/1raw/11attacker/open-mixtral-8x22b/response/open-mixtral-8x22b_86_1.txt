To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

First, let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the population demographics.
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 based on the population demographics.
- P(I|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black, which is 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy.
- P(I|W) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are actually white, which is 0.20 (the witness's error rate).

We are interested in finding P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|I) = P(I|B)P(B) / [P(I|B)P(B) + P(I|W)P(W)].

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.38

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.38 (or 38%).

Here's the dictionary format:
