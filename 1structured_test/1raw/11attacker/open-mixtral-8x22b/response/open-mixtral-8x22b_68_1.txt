To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black = 0.15
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is indeed black = 0.8
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black = 0.2

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Since ~A (not A) means that the attacker is white, we can find P(~A) as follows:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
