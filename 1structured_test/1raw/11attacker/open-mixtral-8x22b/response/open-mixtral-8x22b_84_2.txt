To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It's stated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability, which is the probability of hypothesis A given evidence B.
- P(B|A) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing evidence B given hypothesis A.
- P(A) is the prior probability, which is the initial probability of hypothesis A.
- P(B) is the marginal likelihood, which is the total probability of observing evidence B.

In this case, let's define:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (given that the attacker is black, the witness correctly identifies them as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the city's population)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white, given the city's population)

To calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), we also need to know P(B|~A) and P(B):
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (given that the attacker is white, the witness incorrectly identifies them as black 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
