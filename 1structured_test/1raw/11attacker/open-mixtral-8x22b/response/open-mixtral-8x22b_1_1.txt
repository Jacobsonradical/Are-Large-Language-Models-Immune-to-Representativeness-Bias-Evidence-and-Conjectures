To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

We know the following:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black)

P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black, i.e., they are white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Let's compute the values:

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
