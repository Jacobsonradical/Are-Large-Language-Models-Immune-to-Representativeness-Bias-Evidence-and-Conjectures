To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, all divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the above expression gives:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.476

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.476, or 47.6%.
