To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black

From the information given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is not black)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the known values:
P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here is the answer in the requested dictionary format:
{probability: 0.41}
