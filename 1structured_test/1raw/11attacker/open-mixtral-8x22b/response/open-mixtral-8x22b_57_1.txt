To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial demographics of the city, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's race.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is black. Based on the population demographics, P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. According to the given information, P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% of the time).
- P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, and there are only two races considered, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (20% of the time).
- P(¬A) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substitute the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now calculate the value:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
