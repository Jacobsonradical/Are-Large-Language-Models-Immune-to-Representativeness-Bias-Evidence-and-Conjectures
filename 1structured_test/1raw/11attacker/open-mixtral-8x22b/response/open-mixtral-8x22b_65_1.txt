To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote B as the event that the attacker is black and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Where:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. From the information provided, this is 0.80 (80%).
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the information provided, this is 0.15 (15%).
- P(W|~B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white). This is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.20 (20%).
- P(~B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black. Since the population is 85% white, this is 0.85 (85%).

Now, let's plug in these values:

P(B|W) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
