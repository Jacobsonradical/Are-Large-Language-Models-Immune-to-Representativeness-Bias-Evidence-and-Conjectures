To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in statistics that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge. In this case, we have prior knowledge about the racial distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying people's race.

Bayes' theorem can be stated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that any given person in the city is black)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that a witness identifies someone as black regardless of their actual race)

Given the information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)
- To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the person is not black. Since 85% of the city's population is white, P(~A) = 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.365.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.365 = 0.329

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 32.9%.

Answer: {probability: 0.329}
