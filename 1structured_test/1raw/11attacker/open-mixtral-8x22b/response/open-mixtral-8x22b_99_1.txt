To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness identification.

Let B be the event that the attacker is black, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Where P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, and P(W|~B) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black.

From the given information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] = 0.4118 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4118.

Final answer:
{
  "probability": 0.4118
