To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness identification (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

Let's denote:
P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15)
P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white (0.85)
P(C|B) as the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (0.80)
P(E|B) as the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white (0.20)
P(C|W) as the probability the witness correctly identifies a white person as white (0.80)
P(E|W) as the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (0.20)

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|C), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / (P(C|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:
P(B|C) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

Calculating the numerator:
0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Calculating the denominator:
(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate P(B|C):
P(B|C) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
