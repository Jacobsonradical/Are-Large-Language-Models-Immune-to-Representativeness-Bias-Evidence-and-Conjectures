To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is black"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black"

Here are the probabilities we have:
- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (from the population distribution)
- P(B|A), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- P(B|~A), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), is 0.2 (from the witness's error rate)
- P(~A), the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), is 0.85 (from the population distribution)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Here's the answer in dictionary format:
