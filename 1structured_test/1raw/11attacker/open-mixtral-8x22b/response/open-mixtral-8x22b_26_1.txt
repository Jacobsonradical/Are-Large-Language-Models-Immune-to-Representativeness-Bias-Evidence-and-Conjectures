To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is black.
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).
- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, which can be found by adding the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified them as black, and the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identified them as black:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

After calculating, the result is approximately 0.4615.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.4615.
