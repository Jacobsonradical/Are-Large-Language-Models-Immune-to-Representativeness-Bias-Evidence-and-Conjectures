To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B): the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population distribution
- P(W|B): the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%) based on the witness's accuracy
- P(W|~B): the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), which is 0.2 (20%) based on the witness's error rate

Now, we want to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now, let's compute the probability:

P(B|W) = [0.12] / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41379 (41.379%).

Here's the answer in the requested format:
