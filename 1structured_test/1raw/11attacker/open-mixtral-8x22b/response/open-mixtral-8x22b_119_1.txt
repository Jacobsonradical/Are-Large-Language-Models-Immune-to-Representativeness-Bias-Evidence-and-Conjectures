To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now we need to find P(B), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black, whether they are actually black or not. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where P(~A) is the probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 0.85.

So,

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.5217

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5217.

Answer: {probability: 0.5217}
