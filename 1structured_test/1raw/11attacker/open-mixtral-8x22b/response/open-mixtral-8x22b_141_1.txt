To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

We know that the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, given that 15% of the population is black. Let's denote this prior probability as P(Black).

The witness identified the attacker as black, which we'll denote as E (evidence).

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, P(E|Black). According to the information provided, this is 0.80.

We also need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, P(E|White). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, this probability is 0.20.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Black|E) = [P(E|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(E|Black) * P(Black) + P(E|White) * P(White)]

P(Black|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(Black|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(Black|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Black|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
