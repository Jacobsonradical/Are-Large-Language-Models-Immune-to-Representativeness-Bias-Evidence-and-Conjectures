To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to calculate conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is black.
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as black, given that the person is indeed black.
- P(A) = 0.15, which is the prior probability of a person being black, based on the city's demographics.
- P(B|~A) = 0.2, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black, given that the person is not black (i.e., white).
- P(~A) = 0.85, which is the prior probability of a person being not black (i.e., white), based on the city's demographics.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the given information, and real-life scenarios may involve additional factors that could influence the probability.

Here is the dictionary format:
