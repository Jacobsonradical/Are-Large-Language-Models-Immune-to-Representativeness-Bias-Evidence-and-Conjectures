To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H (hypothesis) as the event that the attacker is black.
- E (evidence) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given:

- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black)

We need to find P(E), which includes two possibilities:

1. The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identifies them as black.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

We know:

- P(~H) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(E) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
