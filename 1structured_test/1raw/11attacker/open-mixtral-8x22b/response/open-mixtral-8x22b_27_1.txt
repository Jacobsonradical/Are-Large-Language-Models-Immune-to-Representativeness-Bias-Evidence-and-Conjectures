To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(B|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information and using Bayes' theorem, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
