To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now, let's compute the value:

P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
