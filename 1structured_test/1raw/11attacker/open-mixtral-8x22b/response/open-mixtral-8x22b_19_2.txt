To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful in situations where we have prior knowledge about a population and new information from evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the city's population demographics.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as white given that they are black, which is 0.20 (20% error rate).
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black, which is what we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W) as follows:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W)]

Here, P(W|W) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as white given that they are white, which is 0.80 (80% accuracy rate). P(W) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 based on the city's population demographics.

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.20 * 0.15] / [0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85]

After computing the above fraction, we find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification to be approximately 0.154.

So, the final answer is: {probability: 0.154}
