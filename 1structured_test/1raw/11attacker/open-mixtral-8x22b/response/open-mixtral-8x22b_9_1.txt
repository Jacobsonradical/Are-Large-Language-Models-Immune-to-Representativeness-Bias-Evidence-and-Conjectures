To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the prior probability that a random person is black)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the prior probability that the witness identifies a person as black)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To find P(B), we need to consider the witness's accuracy for both black and white people. The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Since 85% of the population is white, the witness will correctly identify a white person as white 80% of the time. However, the witness will incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. So, the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as black, regardless of their actual race, is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black (in this case, white)
- P(~A) is the prior probability that a random person is not black (in this case, white)

We know that:
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

So:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
