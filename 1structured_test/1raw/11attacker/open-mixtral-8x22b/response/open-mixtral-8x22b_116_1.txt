To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population in the city is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

where ~B denotes the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white), and P(W|~B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(W|~B) = 0.2. Also, P(~B) = 0.85, since 85% of the population in the city is white.

So,

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.42857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.42857 (or 42.857%).
