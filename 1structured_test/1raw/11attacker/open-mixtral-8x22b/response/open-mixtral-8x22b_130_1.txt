To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

B: the event that the attacker is black
W: the event that the attacker is white
E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We have the following probabilities from the given information:

P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that a random person is white)

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's race:

P(E|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(E|W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Now, let's calculate the value:

P(B|E) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
