To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the conditional probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W)

From the information given:

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)

However, we don't have the value for P(W). P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of whether the attacker is actually black. To calculate P(W), we would need to consider both the possibility of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying him as such, and the possibility of the attacker being white and the witness mistakenly identifying him as black.

P(W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B)

Where ~B denotes the event that the attacker is not black.

P(~B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.28

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.28 = 0.42857

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black is approximately 0.429.

Answer: {probability: 0.429}
