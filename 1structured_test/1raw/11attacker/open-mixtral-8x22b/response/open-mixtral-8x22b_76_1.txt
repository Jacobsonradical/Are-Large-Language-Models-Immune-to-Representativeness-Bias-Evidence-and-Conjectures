To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4138.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
