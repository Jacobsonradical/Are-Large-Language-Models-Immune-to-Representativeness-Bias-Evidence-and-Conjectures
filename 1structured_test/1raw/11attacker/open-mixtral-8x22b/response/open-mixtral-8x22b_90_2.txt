To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge related to the event.

In this case, let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

From the given information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can substitute these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(B|I) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

By calculating the above expression, we find:

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.519

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.519 or 51.9%.
