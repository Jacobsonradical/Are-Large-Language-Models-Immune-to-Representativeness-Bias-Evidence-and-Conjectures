Given the information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case:
- Event A is "The attacker is black"
- Event B is "The witness identified the attacker as black"

The probability of event A (attacker is black) is 0.15, as given by the population statistics.

The probability of event B (witness identified as black) given event A (attacker is black) is 0.8, as given by the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

The probability of event B (witness identified as black) is the sum of the probability of event B given event A and the probability of event B given event A does not occur (attacker is white), which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of event A given event B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black) is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36 or 36%.

Answer: {probability: 0.36}
