To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H (hypothesis) as the event that the attacker is black.
- E (evidence) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Where:
- P(not H) is the probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(E|not H) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person as black given that the person is not black, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now, let's compute:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
