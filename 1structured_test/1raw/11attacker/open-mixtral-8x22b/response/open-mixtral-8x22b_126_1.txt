Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is equal to the prior probability of the event times the likelihood of the evidence given the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

In this case, the prior probability that the attacker is black (P(B)) is 0.15, as 15% of the population is black. The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black (P(E|B)) is 0.80, as the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. The total probability of the witness identifying a person as black (P(E)) is the sum of the probability that the person is black and the witness correctly identifies them as black, and the probability that the person is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(E) = P(B) * P(E|B) + P(W) * P(E|W)

where P(W) is the prior probability that the attacker is white (0.85, as 85% of the population is white) and P(E|W) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.20).

Substituting the given values:

P(E) = 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (P(B|E)):

P(B|E) = P(B) * P(E|B) / P(E) = 0.15 * 0.80 / 0.29 = 0.3931

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3931 or 39.31%.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information, and there are many factors that could affect the accuracy of this estimate.

Here's the answer in the required format:
