To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful when we want to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We're given the following probabilities:

P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is black, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black, which is 20% or 0.2.
P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.

Now, we want to find the posterior probability P(A|B): the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Since P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) or 0.85.

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
