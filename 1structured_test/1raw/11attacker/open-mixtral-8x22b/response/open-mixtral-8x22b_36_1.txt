To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Let's compute each term:

- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black is 15% or 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black).
- P(~A): The prior probability that the attacker is not black is 85% or 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white).
- P(W|A): The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is 80% or 0.80 (given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).
- P(W|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black is 20% or 0.20 (given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time).

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(A|W) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(A|W) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
