To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is equal to the prior probability of the event times the likelihood of the event given the observed evidence, normalized by the prior probability of the evidence.

In this case, let's denote:

- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a non-black person as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
