To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the initial probability that the attacker is black) with new information (the witness's testimony) to obtain a posterior probability.

1. Prior probability (P(Black)): The probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial demographics, is 15%.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify them as black 80% of the time. However, when the attacker is white, the witness will mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Now let's apply Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability (P(Black|Witness)) = [P(Witness|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness|Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness|White) * P(White)]

Where:
- P(Witness|Black) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black)
- P(Black) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(Witness|White) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white)
- P(White) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability (P(Black|Witness)) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.46

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46 or 46%.
