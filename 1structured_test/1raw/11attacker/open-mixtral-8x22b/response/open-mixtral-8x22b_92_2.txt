To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

First, let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white,
- P(B|I) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (I),
- P(I|B) as the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black,
- P(I|W) as the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is white.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black),
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white),
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time),
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|I):

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|I) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
