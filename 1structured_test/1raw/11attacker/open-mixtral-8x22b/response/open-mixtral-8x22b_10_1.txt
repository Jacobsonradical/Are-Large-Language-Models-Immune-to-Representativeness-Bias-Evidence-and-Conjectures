To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

In this case, we have the following information:

- P(B) = 0.15: The prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial demographics of the city.
- P(W) = 0.85: The prior probability that the attacker is white.
- P(E|B) = 0.8: The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
- P(E|W) = 0.2: The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
