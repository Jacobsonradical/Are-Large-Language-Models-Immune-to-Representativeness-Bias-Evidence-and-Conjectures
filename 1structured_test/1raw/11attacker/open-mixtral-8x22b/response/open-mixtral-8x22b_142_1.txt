To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black. From the given information, we know that 15% of the city's population is black, so P(B) = 0.15.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. From the given information, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white). The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so P(W|~B) = 0.2.
- P(~B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white). Since 85% of the city's population is white, P(~B) = 0.85.

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer: {probability: 0.4138}
