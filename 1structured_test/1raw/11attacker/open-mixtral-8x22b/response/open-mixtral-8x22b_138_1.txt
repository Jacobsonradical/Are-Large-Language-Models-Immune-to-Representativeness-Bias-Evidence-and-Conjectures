To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, let's define:
- Event A as the attacker being black.
- Event B as the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black, is 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, is 0.20 (the witness makes errors 20% of the time, so they will incorrectly identify a white person as black in 20% of cases).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

P(~A), the probability that the attacker is not black, is 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white).

Let's calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
