Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is equal to the product of the prior probability of the event and the likelihood of the evidence given the event, divided by the prior probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.80 (the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.20 (the likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values:
P(B|E) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating this gives:
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.357 or 35.7%.
