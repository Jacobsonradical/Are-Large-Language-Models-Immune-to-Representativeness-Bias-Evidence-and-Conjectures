To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A_b), given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W_b).

First, let's denote the prior probability of the attacker being black as P(A_b) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black). The prior probability of the attacker being white is then P(A_w) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black, P(W_b|A_b) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time). Similarly, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is P(W_b|A_w) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A_b|W_b) = P(W_b|A_b) \* P(A_b) / [P(W_b|A_b) \* P(A_b) + P(W_b|A_w) \* P(A_w)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A_b|W_b) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A_b|W_b) â‰ˆ 0.3846

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3846 or 38.46%.
