To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, P(Black | Witness ID).

Let's denote the following events:
B: The attacker is black.
W: The attacker is white.
I: The witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

The witness identification probabilities:
P(I | B) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(I | W) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(B | I):

P(B | I) = [P(I | B) * P(B)] / [P(I | B) * P(B) + P(I | W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B | I) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(B | I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B | I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B | I) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, given the witness's identification.

Final answer in the requested format:
{
  "probability": 0.41
