To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 0.80 (given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black, which is 0.20 (given that the witness makes an error 20% of the time)
- P(~B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(B|W) that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Now, let's compute the value:

P(B|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
