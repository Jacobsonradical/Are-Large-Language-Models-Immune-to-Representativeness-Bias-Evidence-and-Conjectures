To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(B|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
