To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- I as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white)
- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(W) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is white)

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(B|I) = 0.12 / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
