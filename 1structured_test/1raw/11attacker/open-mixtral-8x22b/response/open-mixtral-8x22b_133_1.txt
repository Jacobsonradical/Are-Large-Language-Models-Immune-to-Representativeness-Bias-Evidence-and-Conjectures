To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the attacker is white
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.80 (80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|W) = 0.20 (20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|E) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.46 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46 or 46%.
