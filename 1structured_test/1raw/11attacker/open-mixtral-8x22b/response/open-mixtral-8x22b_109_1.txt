  "explanation": "To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the Bayes' theorem. Let's denote: P(A) as the probability of the attacker being black, P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, and P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. We know that P(A) = 0.15 (from the fact that 15% of the population is black), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy in identifying race). We also need to know P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2. The probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black, P(B), can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26. Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 ≈ 0.4667."
