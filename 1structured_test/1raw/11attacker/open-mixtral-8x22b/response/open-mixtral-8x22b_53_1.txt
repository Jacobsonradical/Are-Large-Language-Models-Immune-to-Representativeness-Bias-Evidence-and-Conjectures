To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) is given by:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Since 85% of the population is white, it follows that:
- P(~B) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
