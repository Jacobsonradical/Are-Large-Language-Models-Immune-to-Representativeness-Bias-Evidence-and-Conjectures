To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the racial demographics of the city, and the new evidence is the witness identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black
- P(~B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black (which is 1 - P(B) since these are the only two possibilities)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (since the witness erroneously identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the witness identification and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Here is the dictionary format:
