To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case states:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identifies as black)

From the information given:
- P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)

To find P(witness identifies as black), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identifies as black) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

From the information given:
- P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases and identifies a white person as black)
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white)

Now we can compute the probabilities:

P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
P(witness identifies as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.31

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.387 or 38.7%.
