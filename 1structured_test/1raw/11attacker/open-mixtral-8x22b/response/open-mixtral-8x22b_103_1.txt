To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 0.2 (20%)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified him as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We can find P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

Since ~B (the attacker is not black) is the complement of B, P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (85%).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.31

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387 (38.7%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.387.

Answer: {probability: 0.387}
