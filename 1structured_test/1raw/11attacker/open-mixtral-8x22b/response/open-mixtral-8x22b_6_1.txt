To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black (i.e., white), which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute this as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now, we can plug in the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).

Here's the answer in the requested format:
