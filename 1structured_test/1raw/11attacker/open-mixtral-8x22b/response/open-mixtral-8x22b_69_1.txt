To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used when we want to update our belief or hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on some observed evidence (the witness identification).

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identifies a person as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person is black (0.15 in this case)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is actually black (0.80 in this case)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black (0.20 in this case)
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (the probability we want to find)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41.
