To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that deals with conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We know the following:
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black. This is 80%, or 0.8, based on the witness's accuracy in identifying race.
- P(B) is the prior probability that a random individual in the city is black. This is 15%, or 0.15, based on the city's demographics.
- P(W) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W)

Here, P(W|W) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are white, which is the error rate of 20%, or 0.2. P(W) is the prior probability that a random individual in the city is white, which is 85%, or 0.85.

Now, let's calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
