To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful when we want to update our understanding of a situation based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black,
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, given by the city's population (15%),
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black (80% based on the given information),
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a non-black person as black (20% of the time since the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases),
- P(~B) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black (85%).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
