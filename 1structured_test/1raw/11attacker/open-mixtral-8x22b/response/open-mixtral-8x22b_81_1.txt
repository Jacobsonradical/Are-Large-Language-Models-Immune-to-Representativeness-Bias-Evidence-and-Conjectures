To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful in this case as we have prior probabilities and likelihoods.

The prior probability (P(B)) that the attacker is black is 15%, or 0.15, based on the population demographics.

The likelihood (P(W|B)) that the witness would identify a black person as black is 80%, or 0.8, based on the witness's accuracy.

The likelihood (P(W|~B)) that the witness would incorrectly identify a non-black person as black is 20%, or 0.2, based on the witness's error rate.

The prior probability (P(~B)) that the attacker is not black is 85%, or 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability (P(B|W)) that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as such:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
