Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black".

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is not black, i.e. is white).

Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4348

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4348 or 43.48%.

Here's the answer in dictionary format:
{
  "probability": 0.4348,
  "explanation": "Using Bayes' theorem, we calculated the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black."
