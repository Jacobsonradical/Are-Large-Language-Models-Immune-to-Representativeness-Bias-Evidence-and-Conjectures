To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black".

The probability of A (the attacker being black) is given as 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black).

The probability of B given A (the witness identifying a black person as black) is 0.8 (80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a person's race).

The probability of B (the witness identifying a person as black) is a bit more complex to calculate. It depends on both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (0.15 * 0.8) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.85 * 0.2).

So, the probability of B is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.215.

Now we can calculate the probability of A given B (the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.215 = 0.558.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.558, or 55.8%.

Here is the answer in the requested dictionary format:
