To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "The attacker is black" and event B is "The witness identified the attacker as black".

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (which is 0.15 based on the population statistics)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black (which is 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is 0.20 based on the witness's error rate)
- P(~A) as the prior probability that the attacker is not black (which is 0.85 based on the population statistics)

By applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.357.

Here's the answer in the required format:
