To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H (Hypothesis) as the event that the attacker is black.
- ¬H as the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., white).
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using the given information, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is white)

P(E|H) = 0.80 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(E|¬H) = 0.20 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.5294

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.5294 or 52.94%.
