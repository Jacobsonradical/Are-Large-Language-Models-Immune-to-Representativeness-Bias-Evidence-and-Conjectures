To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's define the events as follows:
A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We know the following probabilities:
P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is black, which is 80% or 0.80.
P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is not black (i.e., white), which is 20% or 0.20, as the witness makes an error in 20% of cases.

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41. This means that there is a 41% chance that the attacker is black.
