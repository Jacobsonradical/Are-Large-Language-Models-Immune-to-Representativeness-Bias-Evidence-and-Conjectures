To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for updating our beliefs in light of new evidence.

First, let's denote some probabilities:
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 according to the population distribution.
- P(W) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 according to the population distribution.
- P(I|B) is the probability of identifying someone as black given that they are black, which is 0.80 according to the witness's accuracy.
- P(I|W) is the probability of identifying someone as black given that they are white, which is 0.20 (1 - 0.80) according to the witness's accuracy.

We want to find P(B|I), the probability of the attacker being black given that they were identified as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|I) = P(I|B) * P(B) / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|I) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Simplifying the expression:

P(B|I) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, based on the witness's identification and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.41}
