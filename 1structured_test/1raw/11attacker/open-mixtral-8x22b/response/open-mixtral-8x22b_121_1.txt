To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black (B) given the witness identification (W) as follows:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|!B) * P(!B)]

Where:
- P(B|W) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification.
- P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is indeed black.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black).
- P(W|!B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black (i.e., white).
- P(!B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is white).

From the provided information, we know that P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time) and P(W|!B) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying race).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

By performing the calculations, we find that:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.38

So, given the witness identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.38 or 38%.
