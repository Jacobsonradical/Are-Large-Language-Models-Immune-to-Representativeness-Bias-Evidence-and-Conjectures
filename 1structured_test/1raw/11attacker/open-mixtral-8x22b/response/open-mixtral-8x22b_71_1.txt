To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, our initial belief is the population distribution (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness identification (80% accurate).

Let's define the events as follows:
B: The attacker is black.
W: The attacker is white.
E: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black, based on population distribution)
P(W) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is white, based on population distribution)
P(E|B) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
P(E|W) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(B|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the given values:
P(B|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result:
P(B|E) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
