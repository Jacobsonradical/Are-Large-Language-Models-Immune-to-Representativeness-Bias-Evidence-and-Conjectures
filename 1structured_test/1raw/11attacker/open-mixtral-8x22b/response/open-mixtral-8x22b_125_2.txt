To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(B): the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(W|B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that he is black, which is 80% or 0.80
- P(W): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(B) * P(W|B) + P(!B) * P(W|!B)

Here, P(!B) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 85% or 0.85, and P(W|!B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that he is not black, which is 20% or 0.20 (the witness's error rate).

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(B) * P(W|B)] / P(W)
P(B|W) = (0.15 * 0.80) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.
