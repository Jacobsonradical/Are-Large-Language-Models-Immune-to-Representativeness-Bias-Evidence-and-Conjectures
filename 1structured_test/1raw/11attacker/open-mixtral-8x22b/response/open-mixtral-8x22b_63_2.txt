To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It provides a way to update our understanding of probabilities based on the occurrence of new events.

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (WB). This can be written as P(B|WB).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|WB) = [P(WB|B) * P(B)] / P(WB).

We know the following:
- P(WB|B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is indeed black. According to the given information, this is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the racial distribution of the city population.
- To find P(WB), we need to consider the probabilities of both white and black people being identified as black by the witness. This can be calculated as P(WB) = P(WB|B) * P(B) + P(WB|W) * P(W).
    * P(WB|W) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is white. This is the error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(W) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:
- P(WB) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.255.

Now we can calculate P(B|WB):
- P(B|WB) = [P(WB|B) * P(B)] / P(WB) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.470588.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.470588 or 47.0588%.

Answer in the required format:

  probability: 0.470588
