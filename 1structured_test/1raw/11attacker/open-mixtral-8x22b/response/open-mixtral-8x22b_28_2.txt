To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, let's define:
- Event A as "the attacker is black"
- Event B as "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker (black or white):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Now, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

The answer in the requested dictionary format is:
