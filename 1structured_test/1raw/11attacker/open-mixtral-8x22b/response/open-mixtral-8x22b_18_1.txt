To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that there is an 85% chance the attacker is white and a 15% chance the attacker is black (based on the racial composition of the city). The new evidence is the witness testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event A given an event B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B) is the marginal probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, regardless of the person's actual race)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% chance the attacker is white)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

First, we need to calculate P(B), the marginal probability of the witness identifying a person as black. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29 (or 29%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (or 41.38%)

So, given the witness testimony, the updated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.38%. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different due to various factors not accounted for in this calculation.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
