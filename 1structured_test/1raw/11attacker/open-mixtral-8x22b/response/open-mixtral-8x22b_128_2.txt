To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial composition of the city, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)

We also know that the witness can make mistakes and incorrectly identify race 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is:

P(W|not B) = 0.2 (since the witness is equally likely to make an error regardless of race)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

We know that:
- P(not B) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(B|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the dictionary format:
