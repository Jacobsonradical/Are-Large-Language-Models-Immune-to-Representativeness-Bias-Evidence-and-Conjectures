To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

In this case, let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which is 80% or 0.8 (based on the witness's accuracy).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, which is 20% or 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Since P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, and the population is 85% white, P(~A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is 0.5 or 50%.
