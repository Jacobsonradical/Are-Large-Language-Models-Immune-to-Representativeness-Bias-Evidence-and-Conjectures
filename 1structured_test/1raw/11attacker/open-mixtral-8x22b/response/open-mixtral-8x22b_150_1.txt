To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 0.15 based on the given information.
- P(W) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is white, which is 0.85 based on the given information.
- P(C|B) as the probability that the witness would identify a person as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 0.80 based on the given information.
- P(C|W) as the probability that the witness would identify a person as black given that the person is actually white, which is 0.20 based on the given information (20% error rate).

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|C), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / (P(C|B) * P(B) + P(C|W) * P(W))

Substituting the given values:

P(B|C) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

Now, let's compute the values:

P(B|C) = (0.12) / ((0.12) + (0.17))
P(B|C) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|C) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.

In the required dictionary format:
