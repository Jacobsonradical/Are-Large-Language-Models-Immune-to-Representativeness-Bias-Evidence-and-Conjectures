To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- E: the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 based on the racial composition of the city
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that the person is not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.3478

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is approximately 0.3478.

Answer: {probability: 0.3478}
