To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E).

We know the following from the problem statement:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(E|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(E|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we need to find P(E), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This can be calculated as:

P(E) = P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) * P(B) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
