To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that calculates the probability of an event based on its prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness identification (with an 80% accuracy rate).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (0.15)
- P(W) as the prior probability that the attacker is white (0.85)
- P(I|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black (0.8)
- P(I|W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white (0.2)

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|I) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.68

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.68 or 68%.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.68}
