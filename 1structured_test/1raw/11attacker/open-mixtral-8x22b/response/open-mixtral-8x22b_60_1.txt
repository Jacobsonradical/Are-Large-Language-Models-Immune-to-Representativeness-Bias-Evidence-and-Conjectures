To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial distribution of the city's population (P(Black) = 0.15), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the following:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We know the following:
P(B) = 0.15 (from the city's population distribution)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Since 85% of the population is white:
P(not B) = 0.85

The witness makes errors 20% of the time, so:
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
