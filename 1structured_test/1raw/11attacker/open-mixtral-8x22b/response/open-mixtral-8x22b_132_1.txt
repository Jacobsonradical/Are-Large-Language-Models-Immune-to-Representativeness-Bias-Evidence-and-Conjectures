To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H (hypothesis) as the event that the attacker is black
- E (evidence) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

We know:
- P(E|H) (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black) = 80% = 0.8
- P(H) (the prior probability that the attacker is black) = 15% = 0.15

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

We know:
- P(not H) (the prior probability that the attacker is not black) = 85% = 0.85

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can say that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, P(E|not H), is 20% of the probability that the person is white, which is 20% \* 85% = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we have all the components to calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4537

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4537.
