To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs or hypotheses based on new evidence or data.

In this case, we have two pieces of evidence or data:

1. The prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial demographics of the city, is 15%.
2. The likelihood that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is 80%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony as follows:

P(Attacker is black | Witness testimony) = [P(Witness testimony | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness testimony)]

We know that:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.15

P(Witness testimony | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time)

P(Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness testimony | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)

We also know that:

P(Attacker is white) = 0.85

P(Witness testimony | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness testimony) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.4737

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4737 or 47.37%.

Final answer in dictionary format:

  "probability": 0.4737
