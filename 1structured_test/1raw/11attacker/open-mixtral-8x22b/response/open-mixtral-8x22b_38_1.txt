To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is the product of the prior probability of the event and the likelihood of the evidence given the event, divided by the prior probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B), is given as 15% or 0.15. The prior probability of the attacker being white, P(W), is given as 85% or 0.85.

The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black, P(E|B), is given as 80% or 0.8. The likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black, P(E|W), is the error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

The probability of the evidence, P(E), is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a black person as black and a white person as black:

P(E) = P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|W)P(W) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|E) = P(E|B)P(B) / P(E) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.29 = 0.393

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.393 or 39.3%.

Here is the answer in the requested dictionary format:
