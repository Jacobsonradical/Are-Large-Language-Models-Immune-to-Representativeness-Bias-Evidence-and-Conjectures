To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial distribution of the city's population, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We know the following probabilities from the given information:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is black, given the city's population distribution, is 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Since P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3171

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 31.71%.
