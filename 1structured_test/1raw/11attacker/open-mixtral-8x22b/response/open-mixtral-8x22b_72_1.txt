To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability, or the probability that the hypothesis is true given the evidence. This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood, or the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, it's the probability that the witness would identify someone as black given that they are indeed black.
- P(H) is the prior probability, or the initial probability that the hypothesis is true before considering the evidence. In this case, it's the probability that a random person from the population is black.
- P(E) is the evidence, or the overall probability of the evidence.

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

We need to find P(E), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This can be calculated by considering both the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that they are incorrect:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Where:
- P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2.
- P(~H) is the probability that a random person from the population is not black, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

So:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
