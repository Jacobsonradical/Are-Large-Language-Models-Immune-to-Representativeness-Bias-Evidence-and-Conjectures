To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a useful tool for calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (A_B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (W_B).

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (P(W_B|A_W)). Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, we can assume that they are equally likely to misidentify a white person as black or a black person as white. Therefore, the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is 10% (i.e., 20% / 2).

Now we have the following probabilities:
- P(A_B): the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% (or 0.15)
- P(W_B|A_B): the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 80% (or 0.8)
- P(W_B|A_W): the probability that the witness misidentifies a white person as black, which is 10% (or 0.1)
- P(A_W): the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% (or 0.85)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A_B|W_B) = P(W_B|A_B) \* P(A_B) / (P(W_B|A_B) \* P(A_B) + P(W_B|A_W) \* P(A_W))

Substituting the values:

P(A_B|W_B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85)
P(A_B|W_B) â‰ˆ 0.67

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.67.

Answer: {probability: 0.67}
