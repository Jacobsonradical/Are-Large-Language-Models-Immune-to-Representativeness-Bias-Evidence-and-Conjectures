To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B: the event that the attacker is black
- W: the event that the attacker is white
- I_B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

According to the information given:

- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(I_B | B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black)
- P(I_B | W) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, i.e., the error rate)

We want to find P(B | I_B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B | I_B) = P(I_B | B) * P(B) / [P(I_B | B) * P(B) + P(I_B | W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B | I_B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(B | I_B) â‰ˆ 0.5714

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5714.

Here is the answer in the required format:
