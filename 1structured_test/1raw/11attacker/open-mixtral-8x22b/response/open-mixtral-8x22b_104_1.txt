To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the problem, we know the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15, the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) = 0.85, the prior probability that the attacker is white
- P(E|B) = 0.8, the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(E|W) = 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

By applying Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|E) = P(E|B) \* P(B) / [P(E|B) \* P(B) + P(E|W) \* P(W)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.393

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.393, or 39.3%.
