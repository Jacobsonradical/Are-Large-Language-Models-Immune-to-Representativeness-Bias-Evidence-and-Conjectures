To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

In this case, we have the following information:

- P(Black|Identified as Black) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. This is the probability we want to calculate.
- P(Identified as Black|Black) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is indeed black. According to the information, this probability is 80% or 0.8.
- P(Identified as Black|White) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they make mistakes 20% of the time, so this probability is 20% or 0.2.
- P(Black) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is black. According to the information, this probability is 15% or 0.15.
- P(White) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is white. According to the information, this probability is 85% or 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(Black|Identified as Black) as follows:

P(Black|Identified as Black) = [P(Identified as Black|Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Identified as Black|Black) * P(Black) + P(Identified as Black|White) * P(White)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Black|Identified as Black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.3

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.3 or 30%.

Here is the dictionary format:
