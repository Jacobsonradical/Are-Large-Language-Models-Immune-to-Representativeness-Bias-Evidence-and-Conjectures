To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
- Event A as the attacker being black.
- Event B as the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, is 0.2 (the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases).

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can use the following form of Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Since ~A (not A) means that the attacker is white:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379

So the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.41379 (or 41.379%).
