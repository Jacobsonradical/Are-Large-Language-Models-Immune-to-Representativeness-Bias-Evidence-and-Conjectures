To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, let's define event A as the attacker being black, and event B as the witness identifying the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black.
- P(A) = 0.15, the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial composition of the city.
- P(B|~A) = 0.2, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black.
- P(~A) = 0.85, the prior probability that the attacker is white, based on the racial composition of the city.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the numerator:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Calculating the denominator:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.

Here is the dictionary format with the estimated probability:
