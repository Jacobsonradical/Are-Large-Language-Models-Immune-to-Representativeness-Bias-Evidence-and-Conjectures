To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using the given information, we can compute:

1. P(B), the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
2. P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is indeed black, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
3. P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black regardless of the person's actual race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(B) * P(W|B) + P(not B) * P(W|not B).
4. P(not B), the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).
5. P(W|not B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that the person is not black, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now, we can compute P(W):

P(W) = P(B) * P(W|B) + P(not B) * P(W|not B)
     = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
        â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is approximately 0.4138.
