To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some observed data (the witness's identification) is equal to the probability of the observed data given the event, times the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the observed data.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (as 15% of the population in the city is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (P(B|W)):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Here, P(~B) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
