To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, let event A be "the attacker is black" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Using the information given:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a non-black person as black)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

We can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.326 (rounded to three decimal places)

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.326, or 32.6%.
