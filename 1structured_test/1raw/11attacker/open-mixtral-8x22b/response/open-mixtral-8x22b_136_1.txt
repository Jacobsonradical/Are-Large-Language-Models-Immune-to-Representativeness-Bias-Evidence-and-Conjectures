Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is black, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are given:

- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black, is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is indeed black, is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black (i.e., white), is 0.2 (20%).

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Final answer: {probability: 0.4138}
