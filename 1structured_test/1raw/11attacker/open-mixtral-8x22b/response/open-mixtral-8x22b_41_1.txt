To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

First, let's calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)):
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as black given that the person is actually black (P(B|A)):
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as black regardless of their actual race (P(B)):
- P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
- We know that P(B|A) = 0.80 and P(A) = 0.15.
- Let's denote ~A as "the attacker is not black," which means the attacker is white. So, P(~A) = 0.85.
- Now we need to find P(B|~A), which is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black given that the person is actually white. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time and there are two races, we can assume that the errors are equally distributed between misidentifying whites as blacks and blacks as whites. So, P(B|~A) = 0.10.
- P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.10 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Finally, let's calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black (P(A|B)):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
- P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.585

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.585.
