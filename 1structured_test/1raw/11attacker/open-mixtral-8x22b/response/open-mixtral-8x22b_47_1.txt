To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

We know that:
- P(W|B), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are actually black, is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B), the probability that a random person in the city is black, is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies a person as black regardless of their actual race, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

where P(not B) is the probability that a person is not black, which is 85% or 0.85, and P(W|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that they are actually not black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time when identifying race:

P(W|not B) = 20% or 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here's the result in the requested dictionary format:
