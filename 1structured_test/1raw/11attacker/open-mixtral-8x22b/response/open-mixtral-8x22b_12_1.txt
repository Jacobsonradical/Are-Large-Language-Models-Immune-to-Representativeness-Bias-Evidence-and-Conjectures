To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- B as the event that the attacker is actually black.

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial makeup of the city)

To find P(A), the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, we need to consider both the true positive rate (when the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) and the false positive rate (when the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)

We already know P(A|B) and P(B). We also know that:
- P(not B) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white)
- P(A|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
