To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the population demographics of the city, and the new evidence is the witness identification.

Let A be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, and let B be the event that the attacker is indeed black. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We know that:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the population demographics.

To find P(A), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is black (B) or the attacker is white (W). We can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|W) * P(W)

We know that:
- P(A|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2 (the error rate).
- P(W) is the prior probability that the attacker is white, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the population demographics.

Now we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
