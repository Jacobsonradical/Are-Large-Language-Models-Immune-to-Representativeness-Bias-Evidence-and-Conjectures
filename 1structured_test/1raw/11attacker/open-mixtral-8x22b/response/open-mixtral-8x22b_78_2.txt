To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the attacker is white
- Witness as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(Witness | B) = 0.80 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(Witness | W) = 0.20 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now, we want to find P(B | Witness), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. Bayes' theorem tells us:

P(B | Witness) = [P(Witness | B) * P(B)] / [P(Witness | B) * P(B) + P(Witness | W) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B | Witness) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

After performing the calculation, we find:

P(B | Witness) â‰ˆ 0.5143

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5143.

Final answer in the required format:
