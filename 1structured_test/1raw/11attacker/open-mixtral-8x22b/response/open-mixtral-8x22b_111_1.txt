To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We also know that:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is equal to 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Here is the dictionary format:

  "probability": 0.4138
