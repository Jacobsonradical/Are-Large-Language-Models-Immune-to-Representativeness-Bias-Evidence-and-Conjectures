To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or beliefs. In this case, we have prior knowledge about the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial makeup of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 based on the city's population
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information and using Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
