To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs with new evidence. In this case, the initial belief is the racial distribution of the city (85% white, 15% black), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black)
- P(A) is the initial probability of A (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(B) is the initial probability of B (the probability of the witness's testimony)

In this case:
- P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (the probability that a random person is black)
- P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness's testimony, which can be calculated by considering both possibilities (witness correctly identifies a black person as black and witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black):
  P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
  P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
  P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's testimony and the city's racial distribution, is approximately 41%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
