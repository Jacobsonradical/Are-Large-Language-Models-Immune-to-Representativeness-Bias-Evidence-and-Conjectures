To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior knowledge with new evidence to get a posterior probability.

First, let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): The probability that a random person in the city is black, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Now, we need to find P(~A), which is the probability that a random person in the city is not black, which is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

To summarize the answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.41}
