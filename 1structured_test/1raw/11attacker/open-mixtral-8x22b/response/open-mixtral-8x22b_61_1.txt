To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we have prior knowledge of the racial distribution in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black.

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (since the witness is 80% accurate and makes errors 20% of the time)

We want to find the posterior probability P(B|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W). To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B), where P(~B) = 1 - P(B) is the probability that the attacker is not black (0.85 in this case).

Plugging in the given values:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

So, P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.4615, or 46.15%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
