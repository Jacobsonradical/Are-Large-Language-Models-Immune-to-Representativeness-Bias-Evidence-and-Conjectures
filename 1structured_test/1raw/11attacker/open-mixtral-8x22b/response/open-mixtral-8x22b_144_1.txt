To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- B as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the attacker is white.
- I_B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given that P(B) = 0.15, P(W) = 0.85, P(I_B | B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(I_B | W) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

We want to find P(B | I_B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(B | I_B) = P(I_B | B) * P(B) / (P(I_B | B) * P(B) + P(I_B | W) * P(W))

Substituting the given values:

P(B | I_B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

P(B | I_B) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.357.
