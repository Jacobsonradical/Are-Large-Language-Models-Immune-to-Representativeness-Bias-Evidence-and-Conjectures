To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we have prior knowledge about the population demographics and the witness's ability to identify race, and we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given this information.

Let's denote:
- B as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B) as the prior probability that a random person is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the given information:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W). By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)

Since 85% of the population is white:
- P(not B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black)

The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time:
- P(W|not B) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is approximately 0.4138.
