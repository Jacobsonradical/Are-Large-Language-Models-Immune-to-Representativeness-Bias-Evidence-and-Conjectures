To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (B) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (WB).

First, let's denote the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a black person as black as C_B. According to the information given, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so C_B = 0.8. Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is 1 - C_B = 0.2.

Second, let's denote the prior probability that any individual in the city is black as P(B). According to the information given, 15% of the population in the city is black, so P(B) = 0.15. Similarly, the prior probability that any individual in the city is white is P(W) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black:

P(B|WB) = P(WB|B) \* P(B) / P(WB)

We know that P(WB|B) = C_B = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. We can calculate P(WB) using the law of total probability:

P(WB) = P(WB|B) \* P(B) + P(WB|W) \* P(W)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2. Therefore, P(WB|W) = 0.2.

So, we have:

P(WB) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B|WB):

P(B|WB) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).

Final answer: {probability: 0.41}
