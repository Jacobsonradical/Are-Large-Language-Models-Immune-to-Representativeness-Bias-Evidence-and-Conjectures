To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the posterior probability of an event based on prior knowledge related to the event. In this case, we are looking for the probability that the attacker is black given that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white. We are given that P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

We are also given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. Let's denote P(Correct) as the probability that the witness is correct and P(Error) as the probability that the witness makes an error. We have P(Correct) = 0.8 and P(Error) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black, which we'll denote as P(Identified as B | B). Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, P(Identified as B | B) = 0.8.

Similarly, we can calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which we'll denote as P(Identified as B | W). Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(Identified as B | W) = 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B | Identified as B) = [P(Identified as B | B) * P(B)] / [P(Identified as B | B) * P(B) + P(Identified as B | W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(B | Identified as B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B | Identified as B) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.47 or 47%.
