A person was attacked from behind at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's race. Despite this, we have the following two pieces of information:

{
  "a": "85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.",
  "b": "A witness identified the attacker as black. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half white and half black, the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases."
}

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker is black?

First, feel free to reason and compute. And then please answer the question strictly in the following dictionary format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
