To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, which is 0.8 (80% of the time).
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.34

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.3529}
