To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5455

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.5455}
