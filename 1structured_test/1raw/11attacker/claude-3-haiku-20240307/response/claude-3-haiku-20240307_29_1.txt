To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black.
- The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% for both white and black individuals.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Calculating P(B):
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.34

Plugging the values into the Bayes' theorem equation:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3529}
