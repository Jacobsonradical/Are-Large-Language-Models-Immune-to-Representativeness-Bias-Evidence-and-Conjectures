To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification to the prior probability of the attacker being black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the population demographics)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being non-black, based on the population demographics)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4706}
