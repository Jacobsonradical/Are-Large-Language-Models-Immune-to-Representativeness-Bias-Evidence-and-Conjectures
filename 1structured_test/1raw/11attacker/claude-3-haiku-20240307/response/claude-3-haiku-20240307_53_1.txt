To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
