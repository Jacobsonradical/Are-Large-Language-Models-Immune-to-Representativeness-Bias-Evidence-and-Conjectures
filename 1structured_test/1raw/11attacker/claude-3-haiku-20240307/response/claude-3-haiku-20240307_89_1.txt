To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification to the prior probability of the attacker being black.

Let's define the following:
- A = the attacker is black
- B = the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black, based on the population demographics)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
