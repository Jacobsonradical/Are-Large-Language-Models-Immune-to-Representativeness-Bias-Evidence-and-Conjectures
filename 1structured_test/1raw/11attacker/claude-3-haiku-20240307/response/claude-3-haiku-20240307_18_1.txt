To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the population demographics.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the percentage of the population that is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness's correct identification rate when the attacker is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate when the attacker is not black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the percentage of the population that is not black, i.e., white)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
