To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

Calculating the probabilities:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.33
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.33 = 0.36

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.36}
