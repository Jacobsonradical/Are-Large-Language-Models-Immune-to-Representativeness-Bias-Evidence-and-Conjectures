To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.467

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.467}
