To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:

a) P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)
b) P(A) = 0.15 (the population in the city is 15% black)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
