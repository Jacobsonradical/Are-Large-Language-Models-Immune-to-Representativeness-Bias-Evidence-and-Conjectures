To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / 0.65
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.74}
