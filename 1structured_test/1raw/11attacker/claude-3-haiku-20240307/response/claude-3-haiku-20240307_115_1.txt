To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the demographic information)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not-A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2857}
