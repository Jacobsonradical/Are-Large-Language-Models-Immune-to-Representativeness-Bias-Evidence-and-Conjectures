To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being black and the likelihood of the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black attacker as black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker not being black)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41379}
