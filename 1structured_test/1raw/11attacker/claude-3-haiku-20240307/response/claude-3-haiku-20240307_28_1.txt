To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
