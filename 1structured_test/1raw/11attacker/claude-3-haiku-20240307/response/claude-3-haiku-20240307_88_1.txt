To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
