To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the population demographics.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
