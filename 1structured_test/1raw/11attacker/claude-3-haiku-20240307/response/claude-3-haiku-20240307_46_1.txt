To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the demographic information about the city.

Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(B) = 0.15 (from the information that 15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.429}
