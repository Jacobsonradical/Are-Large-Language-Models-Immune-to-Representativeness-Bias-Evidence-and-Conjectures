To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(black attacker | witness identification) = (P(witness identification | black attacker) * P(black attacker)) / P(witness identification)

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Step 1: Calculate P(black attacker)
P(black attacker) = 0.15 (from the given information)

Step 2: Calculate P(witness identification | black attacker)
P(witness identification | black attacker) = 0.8 (from the given information)

Step 3: Calculate P(witness identification)
P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | black attacker) * P(black attacker) + P(witness identification | white attacker) * P(white attacker)
P(witness identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Step 4: Calculate P(black attacker | witness identification)
P(black attacker | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 = 0.52

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.52}
