To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.34

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.3529}
