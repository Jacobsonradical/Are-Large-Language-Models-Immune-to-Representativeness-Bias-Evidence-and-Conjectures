To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
