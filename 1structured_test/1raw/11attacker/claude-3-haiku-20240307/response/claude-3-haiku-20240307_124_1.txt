To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which can be calculated based on the population demographics provided in the problem statement. The proportion of the black population is 15%, so P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 20% in the problem statement.
  P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2857}
