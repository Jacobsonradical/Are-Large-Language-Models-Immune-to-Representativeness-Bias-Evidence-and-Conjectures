To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
   - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black)
   - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, i.e., white)

Substituting the values:
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
