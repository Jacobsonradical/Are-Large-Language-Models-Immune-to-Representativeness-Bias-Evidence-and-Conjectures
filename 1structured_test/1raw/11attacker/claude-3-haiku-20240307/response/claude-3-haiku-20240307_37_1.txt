To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the proportion of non-black people in the population is 85%)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4706}
