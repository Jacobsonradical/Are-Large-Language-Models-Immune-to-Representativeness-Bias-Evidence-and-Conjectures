To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
