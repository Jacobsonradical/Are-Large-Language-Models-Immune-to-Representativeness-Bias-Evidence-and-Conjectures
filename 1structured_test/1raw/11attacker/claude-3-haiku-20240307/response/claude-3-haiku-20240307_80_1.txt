To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the population)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.44

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.44}
