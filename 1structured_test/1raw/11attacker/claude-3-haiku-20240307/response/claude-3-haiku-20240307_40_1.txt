To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Plugging the values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
