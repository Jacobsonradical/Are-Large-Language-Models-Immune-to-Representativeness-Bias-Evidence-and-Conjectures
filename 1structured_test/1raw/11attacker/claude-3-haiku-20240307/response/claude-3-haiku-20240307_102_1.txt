To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the population is 85%)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4375}
