To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given information:
a) 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
b) The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Calculating P(B):
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black)
P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging the values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
