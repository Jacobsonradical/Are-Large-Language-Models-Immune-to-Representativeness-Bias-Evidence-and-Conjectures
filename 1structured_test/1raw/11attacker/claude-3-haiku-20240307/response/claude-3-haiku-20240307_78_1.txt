To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(B) = the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) = the probability that the attacker is white
- P(ID|B) = the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black
- P(ID|W) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(ID|B) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(ID|W) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(B|ID) = (P(ID|B) * P(B)) / (P(ID|B) * P(B) + P(ID|W) * P(W))
P(B|ID) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(B|ID) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
