To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Step 1: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = Proportion of black people in the population = 0.15

Step 2: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black = 0.80

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.32

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
