To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability we want to find is P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
        = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
     = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
