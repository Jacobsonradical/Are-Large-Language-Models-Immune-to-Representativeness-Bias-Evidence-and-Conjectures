To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
