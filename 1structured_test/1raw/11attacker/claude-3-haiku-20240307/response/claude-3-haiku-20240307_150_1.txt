To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as black

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of non-black people in the population is 85%)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.45

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.45 = 0.2667

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2667}
