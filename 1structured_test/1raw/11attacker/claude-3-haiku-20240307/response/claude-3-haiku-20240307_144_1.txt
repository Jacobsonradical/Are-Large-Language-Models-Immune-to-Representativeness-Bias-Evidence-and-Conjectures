To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.4615.
