To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4286}
