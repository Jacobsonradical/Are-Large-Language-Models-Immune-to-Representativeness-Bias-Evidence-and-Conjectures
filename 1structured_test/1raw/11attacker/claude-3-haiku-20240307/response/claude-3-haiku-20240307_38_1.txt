To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706
