To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information, 15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is not black, i.e., white)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the attacker is not black, i.e., white)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.32

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.32}
