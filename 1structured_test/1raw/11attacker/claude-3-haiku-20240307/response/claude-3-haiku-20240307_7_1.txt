To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification, to the prior probability of the attacker being black.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(B) = the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(W|B) = the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, which is 0.8 (from the witness reliability information)
- P(W|W) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white, which is 0.2 (from the witness reliability information)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * (1 - P(B)))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
