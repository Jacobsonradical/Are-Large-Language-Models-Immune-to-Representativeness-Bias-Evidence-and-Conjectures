Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of non-black people in the population)

Plugging in the values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.286

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.286}
