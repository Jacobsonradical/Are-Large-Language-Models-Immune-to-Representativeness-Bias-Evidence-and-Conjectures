To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)

Step 2: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.36

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.36 = 0.33

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.33}
