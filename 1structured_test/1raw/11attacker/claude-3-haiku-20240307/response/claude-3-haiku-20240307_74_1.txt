To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker's race given the witness's identification to the prior probability of the attacker's race and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population composition)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
