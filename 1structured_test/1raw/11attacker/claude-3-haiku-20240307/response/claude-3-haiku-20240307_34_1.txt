To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (the attacker being black) and the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black).

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black is 15%)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black)

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.316}
