To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is not black)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.33

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.33 = 0.3636

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3636}
