To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the prior probabilities of the attacker's race in the population.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
        = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
        = 0.38

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3158}
