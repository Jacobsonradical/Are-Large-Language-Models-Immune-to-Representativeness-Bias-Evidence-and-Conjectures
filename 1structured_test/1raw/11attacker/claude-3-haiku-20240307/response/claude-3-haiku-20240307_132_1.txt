To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the percentage of the population that is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the percentage of the population that is white)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.32

Plugging the values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.375}
