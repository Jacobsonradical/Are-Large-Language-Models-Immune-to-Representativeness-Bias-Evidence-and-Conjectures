To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black, based on the population demographics)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.68

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.68}
