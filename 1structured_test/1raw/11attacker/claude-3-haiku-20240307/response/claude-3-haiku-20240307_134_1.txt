To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.467

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.467}
