To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.45 / (0.45 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.726

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.726}
