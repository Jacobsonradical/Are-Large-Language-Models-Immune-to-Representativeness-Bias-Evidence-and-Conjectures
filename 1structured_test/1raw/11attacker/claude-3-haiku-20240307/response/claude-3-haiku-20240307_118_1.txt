To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.27

Plugging the values into the Bayes' theorem equation:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.44

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.44}
