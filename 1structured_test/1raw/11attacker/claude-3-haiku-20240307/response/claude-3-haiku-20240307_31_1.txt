To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
