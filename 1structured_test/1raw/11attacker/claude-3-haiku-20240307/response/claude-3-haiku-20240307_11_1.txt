{probability: 0.5}

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.5

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.5 or 50%.
