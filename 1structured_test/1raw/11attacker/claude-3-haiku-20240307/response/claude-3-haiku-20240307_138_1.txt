To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the city's population is 85% white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
