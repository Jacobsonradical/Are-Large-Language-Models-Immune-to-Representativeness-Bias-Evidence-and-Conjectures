To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% black)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.365 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, calculated using the law of total probability)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.365 = 0.328

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.328}
