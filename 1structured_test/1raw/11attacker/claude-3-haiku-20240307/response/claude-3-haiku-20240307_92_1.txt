To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population distribution)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(W|not-B) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not-B) * P(not-B))
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
