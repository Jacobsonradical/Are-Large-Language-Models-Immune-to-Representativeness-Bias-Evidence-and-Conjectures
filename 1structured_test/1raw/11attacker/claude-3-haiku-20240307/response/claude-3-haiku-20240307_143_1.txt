To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.4706}
