To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification and the population demographics.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
      = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.41}
