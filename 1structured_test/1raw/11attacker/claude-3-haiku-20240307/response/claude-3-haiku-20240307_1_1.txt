To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are interested in the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the population statistics).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.37

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.324}
