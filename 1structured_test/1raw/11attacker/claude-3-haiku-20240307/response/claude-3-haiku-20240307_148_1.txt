To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness identification).

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15%).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.37

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.324}
