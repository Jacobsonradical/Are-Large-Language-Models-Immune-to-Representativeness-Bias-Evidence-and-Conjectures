To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
