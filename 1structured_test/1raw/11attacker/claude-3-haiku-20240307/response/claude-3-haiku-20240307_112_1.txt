To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4545

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.4545}
