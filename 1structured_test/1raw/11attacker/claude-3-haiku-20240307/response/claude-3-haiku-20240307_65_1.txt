To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the following events:
- B: The attacker is black.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

Substituting the values:
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42
P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.286}
