To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the events involved.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.444}
