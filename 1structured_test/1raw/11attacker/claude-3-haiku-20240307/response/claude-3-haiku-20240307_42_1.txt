To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The court assessed the witness's ability to correctly identify race as 80% (correct identification) and 20% (incorrect identification).

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified them as black, which is P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is 0.80 (the witness's correct identification rate).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (the population proportion of black people).
- P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.38

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is:

{probability: 0.316}
