To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the demographic information about the city.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4545 (or approximately 45.45%)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4545}
