To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness identification and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- B: the attacker is black
- W: the attacker is white
- I: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification:

P(B|I) = (P(I|B) * P(B)) / (P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W))

Given the information provided:
- P(I|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(I|W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
