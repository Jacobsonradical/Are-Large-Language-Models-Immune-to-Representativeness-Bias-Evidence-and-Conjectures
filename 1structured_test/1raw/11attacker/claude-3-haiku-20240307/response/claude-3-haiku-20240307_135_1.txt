To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
