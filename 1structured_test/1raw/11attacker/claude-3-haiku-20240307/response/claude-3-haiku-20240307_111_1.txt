To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.2927

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2927}
