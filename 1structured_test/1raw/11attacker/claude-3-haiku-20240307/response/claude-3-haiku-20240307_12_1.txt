Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is white)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2857}
