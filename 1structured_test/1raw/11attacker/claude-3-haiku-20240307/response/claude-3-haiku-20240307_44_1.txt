To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is white)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
