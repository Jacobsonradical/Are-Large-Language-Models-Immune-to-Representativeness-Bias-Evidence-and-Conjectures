To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to calculate the conditional probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge about the event.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, given the population distribution)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.429}
