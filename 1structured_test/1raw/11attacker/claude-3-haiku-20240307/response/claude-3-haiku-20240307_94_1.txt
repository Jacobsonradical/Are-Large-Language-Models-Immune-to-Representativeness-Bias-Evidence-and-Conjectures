To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the information that 15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given in the problem)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given in the problem)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, i.e., the attacker is white)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
