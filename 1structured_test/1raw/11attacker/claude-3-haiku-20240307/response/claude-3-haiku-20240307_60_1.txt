To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, given the population demographics)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.31

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.31 = 0.387

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.387 or 38.7%.
