To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (the attacker being black) and the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black).

Given information:
- The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (15%).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.34

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.3529}
