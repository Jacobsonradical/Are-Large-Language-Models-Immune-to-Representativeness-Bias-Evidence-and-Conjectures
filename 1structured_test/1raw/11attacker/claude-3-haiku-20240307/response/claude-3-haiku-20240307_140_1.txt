To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (the attacker being black) and the evidence (the witness's identification).

Given information:
- The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
         = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
