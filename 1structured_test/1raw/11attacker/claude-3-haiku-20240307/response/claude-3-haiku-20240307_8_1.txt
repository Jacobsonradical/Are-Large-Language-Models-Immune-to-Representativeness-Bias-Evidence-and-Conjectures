To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, based on the racial demographics of the city)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given in the problem statement)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given in the problem statement)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
