To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the population demographics.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness's accuracy in correctly identifying a black person)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate in incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker not being black, given the population demographics)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.41}
