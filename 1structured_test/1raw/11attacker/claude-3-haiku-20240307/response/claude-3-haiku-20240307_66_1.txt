Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80% correct identification).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (based on the population demographics).
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.38

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.3158}
