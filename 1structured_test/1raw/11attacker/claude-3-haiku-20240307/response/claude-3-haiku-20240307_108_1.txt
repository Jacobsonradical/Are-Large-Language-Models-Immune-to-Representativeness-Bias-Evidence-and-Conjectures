To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, based on the population demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.47.
