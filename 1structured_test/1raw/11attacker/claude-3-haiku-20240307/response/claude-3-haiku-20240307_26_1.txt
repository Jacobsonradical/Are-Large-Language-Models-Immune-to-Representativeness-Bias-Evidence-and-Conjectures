To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the population demographics)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4615}
