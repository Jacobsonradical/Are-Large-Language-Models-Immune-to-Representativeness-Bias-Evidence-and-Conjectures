To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black, and the court assessed the witness's ability to correctly identify race as 80% accurate.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is the percentage of the population that is black (15%).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, which we need to calculate.

We know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which is the percentage of the population that is white (85%).

We know that:
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.414}
