To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population is 15%)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of non-black people in the population is 85%)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4706

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4706}
