To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (attacker is black) and the evidence (witness identifies the attacker as black).

Given information:
- P(witness correctly identifies race) = 0.8
- P(witness incorrectly identifies race) = 0.2
- P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the population demographics)
- P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the population demographics)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = (P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)) / (P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identified as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white))

Plugging in the values:
P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = 0.45 / (0.45 + 0.17)
P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) â‰ˆ 0.73

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.73}
