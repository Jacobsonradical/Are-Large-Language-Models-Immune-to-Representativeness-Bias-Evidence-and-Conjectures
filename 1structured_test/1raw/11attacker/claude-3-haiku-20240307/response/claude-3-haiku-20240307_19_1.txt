To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is white)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.36 / 0.53
P(A|B) = 0.679

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.679}
