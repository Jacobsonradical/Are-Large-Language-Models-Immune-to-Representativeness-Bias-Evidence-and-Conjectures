To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black population in the city)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Calculating P(B):
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of white population in the city)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.2857}
