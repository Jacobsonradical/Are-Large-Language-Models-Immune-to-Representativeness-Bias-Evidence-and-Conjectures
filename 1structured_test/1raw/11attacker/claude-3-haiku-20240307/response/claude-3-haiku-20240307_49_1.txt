To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

According to the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the black population in the city)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the white population in the city)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.74.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.74}
