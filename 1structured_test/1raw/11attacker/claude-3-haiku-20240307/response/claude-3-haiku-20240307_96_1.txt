To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, in this case, the attacker's race and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified the race of the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identified the race of a person 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is 0.8, as the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 = 0.545

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.545}
