To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's race given the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- A witness identified the attacker as black.
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Plugging in the given values:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black is 15%)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.37 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black)

Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.324}
