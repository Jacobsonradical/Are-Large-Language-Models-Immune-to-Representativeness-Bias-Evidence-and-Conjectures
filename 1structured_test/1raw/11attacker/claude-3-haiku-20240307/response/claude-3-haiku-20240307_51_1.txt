To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black
B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4444}
