To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is black.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Given the information provided:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black individuals in the population)
P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of white individuals in the population)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / 0.65
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.74}
