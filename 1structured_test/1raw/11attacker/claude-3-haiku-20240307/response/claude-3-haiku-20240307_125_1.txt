To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the race as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the race as black 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.4138}
