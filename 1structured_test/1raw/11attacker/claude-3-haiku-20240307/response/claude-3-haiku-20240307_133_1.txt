To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker's race given the witness's identification, to the prior probability of the attacker's race and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

Let's define the following:
- A = the attacker is black
- B = the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given the population demographics)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is not black, given the population demographics)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.41}
