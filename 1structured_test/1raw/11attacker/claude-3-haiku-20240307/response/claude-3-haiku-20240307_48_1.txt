To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the conditional probability of an event (the attacker being black) given certain evidence (the witness's identification).

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
- The witness correctly identified the race of a person as black 80% of the time.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black)
  - P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
