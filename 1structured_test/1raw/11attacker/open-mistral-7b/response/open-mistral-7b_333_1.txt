Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have a witness statement that the attacker was identified as black with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the city's racial demographics and the witness's reliability.
4. Let's assume that if the attacker were white, the witness would incorrectly identify him as black 20% of the time.
5. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that the witness is incorrect when identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 (20%).
6. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of a random attacker being black is 0.15.
7. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is the product of the attacker being black and the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.
8. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black is the product of the attacker being white and the witness's error rate in identifying whites: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.
9. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the probability of the actual attacker being black is higher than the probability the witness made an error in identifying a white attacker as black.
10. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness statement is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a white attacker as black: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black based on the provided information is 29%.
