Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is either correct or an error.

Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, it would imply that a majority of the people the witness encounters are white. Therefore, the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a white person as black is higher than the probability of making a correct identification of a black person.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. Since we don't have any information to suggest that this identification is an error, we can only assume it's a correct identification. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's identification, is 1 (or 100%).

However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis and real-world situations can be much more complex. For a more accurate estimate, additional information such as the context of the attack, the reliability of the witness, or any other evidence would be necessary.
