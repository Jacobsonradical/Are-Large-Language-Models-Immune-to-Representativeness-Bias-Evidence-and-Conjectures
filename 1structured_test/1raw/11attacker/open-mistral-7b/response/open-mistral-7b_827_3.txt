To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races (which might not be the case, but it's a simplifying assumption for this problem), then the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 10% of the time (20% of errors).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that a random person is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.10 * 0.85 = 0.085 (or 8.5%).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 10% of the time and a white person as black 8.5% of the time, the probability that the witness is actually seeing a black person but identifies them as white is 0.10 - 0.085 = 0.015 (or 1.5%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 1 - 0.015 = 0.985 (or 98.5%).

Therefore, based on this information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.985}. This estimate assumes that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races, which might not be the case in reality.
