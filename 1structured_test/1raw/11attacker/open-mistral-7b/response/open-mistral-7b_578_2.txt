Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define some events:

- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being black (given in the question as 15%)
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black, given that the attacker is black (given in the question as 0.8)
- P(W|~A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race as black, given that the attacker is not black (given in the question as 1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(~A): Probability of the attacker not being black (given in the question as 1 - P(A) = 0.85)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|W) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.226

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22.6%.
