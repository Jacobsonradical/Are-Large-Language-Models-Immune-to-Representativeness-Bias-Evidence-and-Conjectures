To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Since we don't have information about the attacker's race being incorrect, we can assume that the 20% error rate applies to identifying whites as blacks.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying an attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies blacks 80% of the time. Since 15% of the city's population is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying an actual black attacker is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

However, due to the witness's mistake in identifying whites as blacks, we need to adjust this probability. Since the witness incorrectly identifies whites as blacks 17% of the time, the actual probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker when the attacker is white is 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1469 (14.69%).

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black) = [P(Witness says attacker is black and attacker is black) / P(Witness says attacker is black)]

P(Witness says attacker is black and attacker is black) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness correctly identifies black) + P(Attacker is not black and witness mistakenly identifies as black) * P(Witness mistakenly identifies black)

= P(Attacker is black) * 0.12 + P(Attacker is not black) * 0.1469

We know that P(Attacker is not black) = 1 - P(Attacker is black) = 0.15 (15%), so we can rewrite the equation as:

P(Attacker is black) * 0.12 = P(Attacker is black) * 0.12 + 0.15 * 0.1469

Solving for P(Attacker is black) gives us an estimate of 0.61 (61%).

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 61%.
