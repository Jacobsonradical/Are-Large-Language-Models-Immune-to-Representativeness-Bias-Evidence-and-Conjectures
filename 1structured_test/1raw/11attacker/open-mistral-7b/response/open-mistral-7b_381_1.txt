Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- Θ: The race of the population (85% white, 15% black)
- E: The witness's statement (the witness identified the attacker as black)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

P(E|H): Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is given to us as 0.8.
P(H): Probability of the attacker being black. According to the population statistics, this is 0.15.
P(E): Probability of the witness making the statement (identifying a black person as black) regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)
Where ¬H means not black (white in this case). P(E|¬H) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which we don't have information about. However, since we know that the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases, we can assume that P(E|¬H) = 0.2

To calculate P(¬H), we can subtract P(H) from 1, so P(¬H) = 0.85

Using these values, we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.483

So our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.483 or 48.3%.
