The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to correctly identify race was 80% and they erred 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black based on their ability to correctly identify race.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is 1 - P(black).

We are given that the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time. So, we can write an equation:

20% = 1 - P(black)

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.80 or 80%.
