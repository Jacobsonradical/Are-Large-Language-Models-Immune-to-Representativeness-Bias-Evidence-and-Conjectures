To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to combine the information about the city's population and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white).

We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities: the attacker is black or the attacker is white).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black has a probability of P(witness said black | attacker is black) = 1 (since the witness is correct when the attacker is black). The probability of the witness saying black when the attacker is white is P(witness said black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability).

Given the population distribution, we can calculate the likelihood of the witness making the observation given the attacker's race:

P(witness said black) = P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

We know that P(witness said black | attacker is black) = 1, so we can write the equation as:

P(witness said black) = P(attacker is black) + 0.2 * P(attacker is white)

Now, we can use the given population proportions to express P(attacker is white) in terms of P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black)

Substituting this into our equation, we get:

P(witness said black) = P(attacker is black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(attacker is black))

Solving for P(attacker is black), we get:

P(attacker is black) = (P(witness said black) - 0.2) / 0.8

Using the information given in the witness statement (P(witness said black) = 0.8), we can calculate:

P(attacker is black) = 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.6. This means that based on the given information, there is a 60% chance that the attacker is black and a 40% chance that the attacker is white.
