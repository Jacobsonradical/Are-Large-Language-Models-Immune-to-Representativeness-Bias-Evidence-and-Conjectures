To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the attacker is either black or white (the two possible races). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy for identifying blacks), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is 0.15 * 0.2 (the probability of the attacker being white * the witness's error rate for identifying whites as black).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker as white is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (the probability of the attacker being black * the witness's error rate for identifying whites as black).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the ratio of the probability of the witness's correct identification to the sum of the probabilities of the correct identification and the incorrect identification.

The probability of the attacker being black is:

{probability: 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.03), probability: 0.8 / 0.83 â‰ˆ 0.962}

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.962 or 96.2%.
