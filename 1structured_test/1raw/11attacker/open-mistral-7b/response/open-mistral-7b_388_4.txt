To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the overall racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that when the witness thinks they are seeing a black person, they are actually seeing a black person 80% of the time.

The witness in this case identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information because we do not know whether the witness was correct or not. To account for this uncertainty, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the attacker's race based on the witness's identification. The theorem states that the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(black|identified as black)) is equal to the probability of the witness identifying someone as black if they are black (the prior probability, P(black)) times the likelihood of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is black (P(identified as black|black)), divided by the total probability of the witness's identification (P(identified as black)).

Let's denote the total population as N. Then, the total number of black people is 0.15N and the total number of white people is 0.85N.

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black if they are black is the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies black people, which is 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black if they are white is the proportion of times the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The total probability of the witness's identification is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(black|identified as black) = P(black) * P(identified as black|black) / P(identified as black)

P(black) = 0.15N / N = 0.15

P(identified as black|black) = 0.8

P(identified as black) = 0.97

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 / 0.97 = 0.82.
