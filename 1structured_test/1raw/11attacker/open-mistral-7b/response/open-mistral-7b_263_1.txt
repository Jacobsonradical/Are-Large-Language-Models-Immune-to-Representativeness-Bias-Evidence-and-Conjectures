The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's observation is independent of the actual race of the attacker (which is a simplification and may not hold in reality), we can use the Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), P(A) = p (unknown probability of the attacker being black), and P(B) = 0.8*p + 0.2*(1-p) (the probability of the witness making this observation).

So, the probability that the attacker is black (p) can be estimated by solving the equation for p:

p = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

p = (0.8 * p) / (0.8*p + 0.2*(1-p))

Solving this equation numerically, we find that p â‰ˆ 0.195.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 19.5%.
