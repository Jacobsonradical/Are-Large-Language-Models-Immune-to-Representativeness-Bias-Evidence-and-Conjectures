Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume the true race of the attacker is W (white) or B (black). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as W or B, given the true race, is as follows:

- For a white attacker (W): P(Witness sees W and identifies W) = 0.8 (probability of not erring) * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) + 0.2 (probability of erring) * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) = 0.70 + 0.02 = 0.72
- For a black attacker (B): P(Witness sees B and identifies B) = 0.8 (probability of not erring) * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) + 0.2 (probability of erring) * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) = 0.02 + 0.17 = 0.19

Now, we have two probabilities: one for a white attacker (0.72) and one for a black attacker (0.19). The witness claimed that the attacker was black, so we should consider these probabilities in the context of a conditional probability.

The probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness saw someone black, is:

P(Attacker is black | Witness sees black) = P(Attacker is black) / [P(Attacker is black) + P(Attacker is white | Witness sees black)] = 0.19 / (0.19 + 0.72) = 0.19 / 0.91 â‰ˆ 0.21

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information, is approximately 0.21. This means that, based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, the attacker is likely to be black 21% of the time.
