To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The attack occurred in a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily reliable. The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness's error occurred in this case (identifying a white person as black), we need to account for both possibilities: the witness correctly identified a black attacker and the witness erroneously identified a white attacker as black.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. The probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white attacker as black is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 85%, multiplied by the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.15 (or 15%), and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since we don't know which of these two scenarios occurred, we should consider both as equally likely. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, or 32%}

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 32%.
