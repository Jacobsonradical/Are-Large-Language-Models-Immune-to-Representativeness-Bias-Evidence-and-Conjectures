To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error was misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa, we'll assume that these errors are balanced (50% each).

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black attacker as white is 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is the probability of correctly identifying a black person (0.8) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white (0.85), which is 0.68.

The total probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as the opposite race is the sum of the probabilities of incorrectly identifying a black attacker as white and incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black: 0.2 + 0.68 = 0.88.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness making this mistake given that the attacker is black, divided by the total probability of making a mistake:

P(black) = P(witness incorrectly identifies black attacker as black) / P(witness makes a mistake) = 0.2 / 0.88 â‰ˆ 0.225

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.225 or 22.5%.
