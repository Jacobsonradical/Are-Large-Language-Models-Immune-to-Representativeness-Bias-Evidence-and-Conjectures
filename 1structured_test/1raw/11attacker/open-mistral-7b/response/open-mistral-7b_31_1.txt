Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, whose ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the witness's reliability.

The witness's incorrect identification rate (20%) is effectively a type I error in statistical terms. If we consider the entire population, there's a 20% chance that a white person would be mistakenly identified as black by the witness.

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the probability of both events A and not A given event B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we've established to be 15%), and let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (which we've established to be 80%). Let P(B|not A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (which we've established to be 20%).

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.414 or 41.4%.
