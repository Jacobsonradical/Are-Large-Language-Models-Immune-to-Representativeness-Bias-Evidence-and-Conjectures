Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
3. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as black.

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct when they say "black" is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given that the city is 85% white, if the witness were guessing without any information, they would incorrectly identify a random attacker as black 15% of the time (the proportion of the black population). Therefore, the probability that the witness is guessing and is correct (i.e., the attacker is black) is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

However, the witness did not guess but made a statement based on their observation. Since the witness was wrong, the attacker must be white. The probability that the attacker is white is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Since the witness's statement led us to conclude that the attacker is white, the probability that the witness's statement is incorrect (i.e., the attacker is black) is the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's statement, divided by the actual probability that the attacker is white:

(0.85 * 0.20) / (0.85) = 0.17.

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.17.
