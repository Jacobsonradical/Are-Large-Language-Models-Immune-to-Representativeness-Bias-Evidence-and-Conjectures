To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given about the witness's ability to identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could be correct or an error. Let's represent the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(White).

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error is 0.20. This means the probability that the witness's identification is correct is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the event we're interested in is P(Black | Witness Identifies Black). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(Black | Witness Identifies Black) = [P(Witness Identifies Black | Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness Identifies Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness Identifies Black | White) * P(White)]

We're given that the witness identifies black people 80% of the time, so P(Witness Identifies Black | Black) = 0.80. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is their error rate, so P(Witness Identifies Black | White) = 0.20.

We're also given that 15% of the population is black, so P(Black) = 0.15. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black when they actually see a white person is their error rate, so P(Witness Identifies Black | White) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Black | Witness Identifies Black) = [(0.80) * (0.15)] / [(0.80) * (0.15) + (0.20) * (0.85)]

Calculating this probability, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
