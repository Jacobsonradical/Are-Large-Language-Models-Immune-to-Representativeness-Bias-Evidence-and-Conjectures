Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory describing the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and we have two pieces of prior information:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race (80%).
2. The distribution of races in the city (85% white, 15% black).

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this context:
- A is the attacker being black
- B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% in the information.
P(B) is the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1765 = 0.2965

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.2965) = 0.12 / 0.2965 â‰ˆ 0.403

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the distribution of races in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.403 or 40.3%.
