Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have specific numbers for how many times the witness identified a black person correctly or incorrectly. We only know that in a sample of people, half are white and half are black, and the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the population. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the witness would have seen more white people in their sample and therefore made more correct identifications of white people.

Let's denote:
- P(attacker is black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(witness correctly identifies black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(witness incorrectly identifies black) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person
- P(witness correctly identifies white) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person
- P(witness incorrectly identifies white) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person

We know that P(witness correctly identifies black) = 0.8 (from the information given)
We know that P(witness incorrectly identifies black) = 0.2 (from the information given)
We know that P(witness correctly identifies white) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 (since the witness has a higher chance of correctly identifying a white person due to their higher frequency in the population)
We know that P(witness incorrectly identifies white) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 (since the witness has a lower chance of incorrectly identifying a white person due to their lower frequency in the population)

However, we don't have enough information to calculate these probabilities directly. We can make an assumption that the witness's ability to correctly identify a race is independent of the actual race of the person, which means that P(witness correctly identifies black) / P(witness incorrectly identifies black) = P(witness correctly identifies white) / P(witness incorrectly identifies white).

With this assumption, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black by calculating P(witness correctly identifies black) / (P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness incorrectly identifies black)):

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 1

However, this result is not possible since the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1. This means that the assumption of independence is not correct, and we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is undefined, and more information would be required to make a reliable estimate.
