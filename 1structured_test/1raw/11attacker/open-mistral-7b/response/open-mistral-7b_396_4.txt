Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is only 80% accurate in identifying race erred in 20% of their judgements and identified the attacker as black. This suggests that while the majority of the population is white, there could be other factors at play that led the witness to mistakenly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time.

In order to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to account for both the composition of the population and the error rate of the witness. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

We know that the attacker is either black or white, so P(black) + P(white) = 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(black) given the witness's error rate and the population demographics. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(black | witnessed black) = [P(witnessed black | black) \* P(black)] / [P(witnessed black | black) \* P(black) + P(witnessed black | not black) \* P(not black)]

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as black, so P(witnessed black) = 1. Also, we know that the witness is 80% accurate in identifying race, so P(witnessed black | black) = 0.8. The population demographics tell us that the prior probability of the attacker being black is P(black) = 0.15.

Using these values, we can calculate P(black | witnessed black):

P(black | witnessed black) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(black | witnessed black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Calculating this fraction, we get:

P(black | witnessed black) = 0.12 / 0.23 = 0.5217

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error rate and the population demographics, is approximately 52.17%. This estimate takes into account both the composition of the population and the witness's error rate, suggesting that while the majority of the population is white, there is a non-negligible probability that the attacker is actually black. {probability: 0.5217}
