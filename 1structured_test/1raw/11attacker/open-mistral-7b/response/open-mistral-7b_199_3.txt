To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black in the general population is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, given the witness's error rate, we need to adjust this probability to account for the possibility that the witness made a mistake. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race (i.e., the attacker is actually black) is the product of the true population probability and the chance the witness gets it right:

0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12, or 12%.
