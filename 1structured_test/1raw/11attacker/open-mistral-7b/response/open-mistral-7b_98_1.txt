Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we are interested in is the attacker being black. The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the city's demographic data: 15% (or 0.15).

The likelihood of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is black, is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.8 (80%).

The likelihood of the witness's identification being incorrect, given that the attacker is black, is the witness's error rate: 0.2 (20%).

The prior probability of the attacker being white is 1 - the prior probability of the attacker being black: 0.85.

The likelihood of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is white, is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black: 0.2 * 0.5 (error rate * proportion of white people) = 0.1 (or 10%).

The likelihood of the witness's identification being incorrect, given that the attacker is white, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person: 0.8 * 0.5 (accuracy rate * proportion of white people) = 0.4 (or 40%).

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = [P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.145 â‰ˆ 0.822

So, based on the given information and Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.822 (or 82.2%).
