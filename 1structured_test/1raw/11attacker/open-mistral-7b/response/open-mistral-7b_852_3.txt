Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The accuracy of the witness's race identification: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if this identification was correct or an error. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(A), and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as P(B|A).

We also need to know the probability of the witness identifying a white person as P(B|~A), where ~A represents the attacker being white.

The probability of the witness making a random guess (not identifying the race) is P(B|~A) + P(B|A) - P(B|A) * P(A) - P(B|~A) * P(~A), where P(~A) is the probability of the attacker being white.

The total probability of the witness's identification is 1, so:

1 = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) + P(B|A) * P(~A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) - P(B|A) * P(A) * P(~A) - P(B|~A) * P(A) * P(~A)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1 = P(B|A) * P(A) + 2 * P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + 2 * (0.8) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.19

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 19%.
