The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness accuracy when the attacker is black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% white population, so 15% black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

First, let's calculate P(E | H):
Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the attacker is black, and errors 20% of the time, P(E | H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H):
As 85% of the population is white, 15% is black, so P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(E):
This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the actual race of the person. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is actually white, and correct 80% of the time when the person is black, the total probability of being identified as black, regardless of the actual race, is:

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.177
= 0.3

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3
= 0.12 / 0.3
= 0.4

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
