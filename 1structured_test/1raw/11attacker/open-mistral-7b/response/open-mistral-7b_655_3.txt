Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness is 80% accurate in identifying race, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know how many times the witness got it right or wrong in this specific case. We only know that the witness identified the attacker as black.

If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. If the witness is wrong, then the attacker is likely white (given that 85% of the population is white). But we can't quantify the exact probability of this error, as we don't have enough information.

Therefore, we can only base our estimate on the probability of the witness being correct, which is 80%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's accuracy in this specific case is the same as their average accuracy. Since we don't know if this is the case, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive answer.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the witness's average accuracy and not on the specific case}
