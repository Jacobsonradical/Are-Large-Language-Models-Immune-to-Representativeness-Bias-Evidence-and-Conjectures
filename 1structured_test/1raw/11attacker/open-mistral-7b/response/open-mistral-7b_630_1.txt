Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial makeup of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial makeup of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's identification is not entirely reliable. In this case, the witness reported that the attacker was black. But we don't have information about the actual race of the attacker.

Given the witness's reliability, we can calculate the probability that the witness is correct in their identification. This probability is 0.8 (80%).

But since we don't know if the witness is correct or not, we cannot use this probability directly to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report would be 100%.

If the witness is incorrect, then the attacker is white. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report would be 0%.

Since we don't know if the witness is correct or not, we cannot calculate a single probability for the attacker's race. Instead, we can calculate two probabilities, one for each possibility.

The probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report is 0.8 if the witness is correct and 0 if the witness is incorrect.

However, we cannot directly use these probabilities because they depend on the witness's reliability, which is not the probability we are interested in.

What we want is the probability that the attacker is black, independent of any witness's report.

Since the witness's report is unreliable, the best we can do is to use the racial makeup of the city as our best guess. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.
