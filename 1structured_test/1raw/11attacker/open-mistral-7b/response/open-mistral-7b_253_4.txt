Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the data, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% accurate when presented with a half-half mixture of whites and blacks, identified the attacker as black.

However, we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness was presented with a half-half mixture of people at the scene of the crime. If it was, then the witness's identification of the attacker as black would suggest that the attacker is indeed black, as the witness's error rate is only 20%.

If we assume that the witness was presented with a half-half mixture and use the witness's accuracy rate, our estimate would be:

{probability: 0.8, the attacker is likely black}

But if we cannot make that assumption, we must consider the overall population distribution. In this case, assuming no other information, the probability that the attacker is black would be:

{probability: 0.15, the attacker is less likely but still 15% black}
