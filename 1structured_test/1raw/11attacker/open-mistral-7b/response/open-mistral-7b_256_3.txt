Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. First, we know that the overall population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. Second, we know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
3. However, we also know that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness must have erred in identifying the attacker's race.
4. Given that the error rate is 20%, and the witness identified the attacker as black, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is likely among the 20% of people the witness incorrectly identified as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, would be the error rate of 20%. However, we need to adjust this probability to account for the fact that the overall population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's call P(B) the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's error. We can represent this probability as the ratio of the number of black people the witness incorrectly identifies to the total number of people the witness sees.

Since the witness sees half white and half black people, and makes an error 20% of the time, the number of black people the witness incorrectly identifies is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (or 10% of the total people the witness sees).

Given that the overall population is 85% white and 15% black, the number of black people in the city is 0.15 * total population. The number of white people is 0.85 * total population.

Therefore, the probability P(B) that the attacker is black given the witness's error is the ratio of the number of black people the witness incorrectly identifies to the total number of black people in the city:

P(B) = 0.1 / (0.15 * total population)

However, the total population is not provided in the information given. Without this information, it's not possible to calculate an exact probability. But we can express the probability as a function of the total population:

P(B) = 0.1 / (0.15 * total population)

This probability P(B) is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error and the overall population distribution. If you have the total population, you can calculate the exact probability.
