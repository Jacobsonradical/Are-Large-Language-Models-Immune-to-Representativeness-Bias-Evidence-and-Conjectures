To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can calculate from the city's demographics (15%)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is given in the information (80%)
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which we can calculate as 1 - P(E|H) (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not black)

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)], where ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 24%.
