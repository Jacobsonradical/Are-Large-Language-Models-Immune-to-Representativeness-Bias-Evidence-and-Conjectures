Given the information provided, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black with certainty. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%. The city's demographics indicate that 15% of the population is black.

If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the race of the person they are observing, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the complement of the probability of the witness making a mistake: 0.80 - 0.17 = 0.63 or 63%.

However, it's important to note that this is an approximation and assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the race of the person they are observing, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as a rough guideline rather than a definitive answer.
