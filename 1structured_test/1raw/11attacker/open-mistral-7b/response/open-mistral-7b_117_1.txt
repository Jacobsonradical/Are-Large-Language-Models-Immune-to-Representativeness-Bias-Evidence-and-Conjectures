Given the information provided, we have a witness who is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct evidence about the race of the attacker.

The witness's identification should be considered as an additional piece of evidence, but it's not conclusive proof. If we were to make an assumption based on the witness's identification, we would give more weight to their identification due to their high accuracy rate.

However, we also have demographic information about the city where the attack occurred. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This demographic information can be used to make a probability estimate.

Without knowing the exact amount of weight to give to the witness's identification versus the demographic information, it's difficult to provide a precise probability estimate. A strict mathematical calculation would require more information.

However, if we were to make a rough estimate, we could consider the demographic information as a baseline. Given that the witness's accuracy rate is 80%, they are likely to correctly identify the attacker's race more often than not, even if the attacker is from the demographic majority. But given that the demographic majority is 85%, it's still more likely that the attacker is white.

Based on this reasoning, a rough estimate would be that the attacker is white, with a probability of around 0.85. But this is a very rough estimate and should not be considered as a definitive answer. A full investigation would be needed to determine the attacker's race with certainty.

{probability: 0.85, please note that this is a rough estimate and should not be considered as a definitive answer}
