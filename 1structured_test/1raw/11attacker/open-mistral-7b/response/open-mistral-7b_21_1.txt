Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifying a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's identification being correct or incorrect), which can be calculated as the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H means not H (attacker being white).

First, let's calculate P(E|H):
P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifying a black person 80% of the time) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H):
P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of black people in the city)

Now let's calculate P(~H):
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (proportion of white people in the city)

Next, let's calculate P(E|~H):
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black 20% of the time)

Now let's calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
