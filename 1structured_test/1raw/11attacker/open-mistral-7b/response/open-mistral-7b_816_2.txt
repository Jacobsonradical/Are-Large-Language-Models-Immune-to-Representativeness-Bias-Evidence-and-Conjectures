Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the probability of event B given event A and the probability of event B given not event A.

In this case,
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The prior probability of event A (P(A)) is given in the first piece of information as 15%.

The probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) is the reliability of the witness, which is given as 80%.

The probability of event B given not event A (P(B|not A)) is the error rate of the witness, which is given as 20%.

The probability of not event A (P(not A)) is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Using the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2368

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23.68%.
