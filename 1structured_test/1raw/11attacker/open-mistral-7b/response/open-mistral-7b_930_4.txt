Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Assuming that the attacker could have been either white or black, and the witness's identification is independent of the attacker's actual race, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of A, P(B) is the probability of B, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A.

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability P(A) is the proportion of black people in the population, which is 15%. The probability of the witness making a correct identification P(B|A) is 80%. The probability of the witness making an error P(B|not A) is 20%, where not A means the attacker is white.

The probability P(B) is the sum of the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the probability of the witness making an error, which is 80% + 20% * (1 - 15%) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.856.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) as P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.856 â‰ˆ 0.158, or 15.8%.

However, the witness's identification is not independent of the attacker's actual race, as the witness is more likely to identify a black person as black than a white person as black. This means that the 20% error rate assumed in the calculation is likely an underestimate.

Therefore, while we cannot give a precise probability, it is safe to say that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, given the witness's identification.
