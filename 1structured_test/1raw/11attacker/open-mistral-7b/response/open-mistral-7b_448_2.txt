Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability (P(A)) is the probability that the attacker is black in the city, which we know to be 15%. The likelihood (P(B|A)) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. This value can be estimated using the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

The posterior probability (P(A|B)) is what we're interested in, which is the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony.

So, the Bayes' theorem formula would look like this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a black person as white, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when identifying race, and there are twice as many white people as black, we can assume that P(B|not A) is also 20%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.2) * (0.15) / ((0.2) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.35, or 35%.
