Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, but they also make errors 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the city's demographics and the witness's reliability.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could be due to two possible reasons:

a) The attacker is indeed black.
b) The witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black.

The probability of the first scenario (a) is the probability of the city's black population, which is 15%. The probability of the second scenario (b) is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 20% because the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.

However, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we know that the actual attacker cannot be white. So, the probability of the second scenario (b) is 0, as it's impossible for the witness to have identified a white person (who cannot be the actual attacker) as black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the probability of the first scenario (a), which is 15%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.15}
