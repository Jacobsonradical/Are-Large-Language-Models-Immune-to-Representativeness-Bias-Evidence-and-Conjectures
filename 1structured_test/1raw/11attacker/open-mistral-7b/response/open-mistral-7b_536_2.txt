The probability of the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying race when the attacker is black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the overall accuracy of the witness in identifying race)

Given the information in the problem statement, we have:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 (the overall accuracy of the witness in identifying race)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.5] = 0.12 / 0.4 = 0.3

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.3 or 30%.
