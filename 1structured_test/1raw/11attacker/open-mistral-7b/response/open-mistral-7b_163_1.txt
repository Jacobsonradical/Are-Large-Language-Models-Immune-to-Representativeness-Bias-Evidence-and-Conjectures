Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily reliable due to their error rate of 20%.

The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, but they also incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we can't simply use their racial demographic data to estimate the attacker's race.

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
