Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black,
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information),
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race when he/she is black (given in the second piece of information),
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race when he/she is not black (since we don't have this information directly, we can use the complementary probability of P(B|A) because there are only two options: white or black).

So, we have P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|~A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the required probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Since we don't have the prior probability for the attacker not being black (P(~A)), we can use the given prior probability of the attacker being white, P(A) = 0.15, and assume that P(~A) = 0.85 (since the sum of both probabilities should add up to 1).

So, the final calculation is:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.252 = 0.473

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.473 or 47.3%.
