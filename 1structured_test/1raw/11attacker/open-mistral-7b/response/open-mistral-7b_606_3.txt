Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated as follows:

1. The population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% under similar conditions, and the error rate is 20%.
3. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.
4. Therefore, the probability that the witness made an error (given that the attacker is white) is 20%.
5. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race (given that the attacker is black) is 80%.
6. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by considering the two possibilities: the attacker is black and the witness made an error, or the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race.
7. The probability of the attacker being black and the witness making an error is the probability of the attacker being white (15%) times the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white (20%). This probability is 0.015 * 0.2 = 0.003, or 0.3%.
8. The probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the race is the probability of the attacker being black (15%) times the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race given that the attacker is black (80%). This probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.
9. The total probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the two possibilities above. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.003 + 0.12 = 0.123, or 12.3%.
