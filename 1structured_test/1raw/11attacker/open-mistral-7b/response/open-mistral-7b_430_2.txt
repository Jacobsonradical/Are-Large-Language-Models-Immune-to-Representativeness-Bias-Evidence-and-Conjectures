To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E, P(H|E), is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H), multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(H), divided by the probability of the evidence, P(E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Let's break down each term:
- P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is black. We don't know this, but we have information from the city's population.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. This is given in the first piece of information as 0.8.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness's identification in general. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of identifying a black person correctly and identifying a white person incorrectly: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H).
- Here, P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is not black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(H).

Since we don't know the prior probability of the attacker being black, we can't provide a strict answer. However, we can calculate the estimate based on the given information about the city's population:

P(H) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information)
P(~H) = 0.85
P(E|H) = 0.8
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.182
P(E) = 0.302

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.302
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.232

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
