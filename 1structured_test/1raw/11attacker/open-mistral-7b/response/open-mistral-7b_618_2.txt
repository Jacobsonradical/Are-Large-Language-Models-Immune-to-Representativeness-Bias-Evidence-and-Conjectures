To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial makeup of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate. If we assume that the witness's observations are independent events, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as black, given that the attacker is actually black, as follows:

Probability of witness correctly identifying attacker as black = Witness's accuracy rate for black people
                                                                                          = 0.80

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white, as follows:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying attacker as black = Witness's error rate * Probability of attacker being white
                                                                                                 = 0.20 * 0.85
                                                                                                 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race, and then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Probability of witness identifying attacker as black = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying attacker as black
                                                                         + Probability of attacker being white * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying attacker as black
                                                                         = 0.15 * 0.80
                                                                         + 0.85 * 0.17
                                                                         = 0.12 + 0.1465
                                                                         = 0.2665

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

Probability of attacker being black | Witness identified as black = Probability of witness identifying attacker as black | Attacker is black
                                                                                                                                      * Probability of attacker being black
                                                                                                                                     -----------------------------------
                                                                                                                                     Probability of witness identifying attacker as black

Probability of attacker being black | Witness identified as black = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.2665
                                                                                           â‰ˆ 0.22

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
