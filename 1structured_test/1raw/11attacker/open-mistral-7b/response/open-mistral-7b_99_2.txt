The information given in point A states that 15% of the city's population is black. However, the witness's identification in point B is not necessarily accurate due to the error rate of 20%.

Given that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

1 - probability of correctly identifying white = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85. The probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is then 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, let's consider the opposite scenario, where the attacker is actually black. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so the probability of this happening with a black attacker is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

However, the witness also correctly identifies black people 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker correctly or incorrectly is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this is the probability we are interested in. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.
