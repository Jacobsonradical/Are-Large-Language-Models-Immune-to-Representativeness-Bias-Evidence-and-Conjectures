Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the witness misidentified the attacker's race, we should consider the error rate in our calculation. The error rate indicates that for every 100 people the witness encounters, they incorrectly identify the race of 20. This means that out of the 15% black population, the witness might erroneously attribute some of them to the white population.

Let's assume that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black (an error). If we know the actual race of the attacker, we can use the error rate to adjust our estimate. But since we don't have that information, we can make an educated guess based on the probability of the witness making such an error.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, there's a 20/100 or 0.2 chance that they made an error in this case. This means there's a 100% - 0.2 = 0.8 chance that the witness's identification was correct.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15.

However, we should account for the possibility of the witness's error. Since there's a 0.2 chance of an error, and if an error occurred, the attacker would actually be white, the probability of the attacker being black, considering both the witness's identification and the possibility of an error, is:

0.15 (probability of attacker being black given correct identification) * 0.8 (probability of correct identification) + 0 (probability of attacker being black given error, since in this case the attacker would actually be white) * 0.2 (probability of error) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, taking into account the witness's identification and the possibility of an error, is 0.12 or 12%.
