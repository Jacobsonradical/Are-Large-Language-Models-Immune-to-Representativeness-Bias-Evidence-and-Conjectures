Given the information provided, we can calculate the probabilities of the attacker being black or white based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (correctly):

P(Black | Witness's statement) = Number of true positives / (Number of true positives + Number of false negatives)

In this case, the number of true positives is the actual number of black attackers multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8). The number of false negatives is the actual number of black attackers multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person (0.2).

P(Black | Witness's statement) = (Number of black attackers * 0.8) / (Number of black attackers * 0.8 + Number of white attackers * 0.2)

Unfortunately, we don't have the actual number of black attackers. However, we can use the information about the racial distribution in the city to make an estimate. Since 15% of the population is black, we can assume that the same proportion of attacks are also perpetrated by blacks.

P(Black | Witness's statement) â‰ˆ (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)

After calculating, we obtain an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.44 or 44%.

{probability: 0.44}
