Based on the information provided, the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying races and a 20% error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we can assume that there was a 20% chance that the attacker was actually white (given the witness's error rate).

However, we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. Given that the witness made an error, it's more likely that the attacker was misidentified as black due to the city's demographic composition. Therefore, the actual probability of the attacker being black is lower than the 20% error rate.

Let's calculate this probability:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is the product of the witness's error rate and the proportion of white people in the city (0.2 * 0.85).

So, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.8 - (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.68 or 68%.

{probability: 0.68}
