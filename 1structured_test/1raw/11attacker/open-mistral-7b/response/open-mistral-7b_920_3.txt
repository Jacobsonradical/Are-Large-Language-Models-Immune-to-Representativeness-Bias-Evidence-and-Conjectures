To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black (P(white) = 0.85, P(black) = 0.15), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black:

P(witness identified black | attacker is black) = P(attacker is black | witness identified black) * P(witness identified black) / P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white | witness identified black) * P(attacker is white) * P(witness identified black)

P(attacker is black | witness identified black) is the reliability of the witness, which we know is 0.8.

P(witness identified black) is the probability that the witness makes a correct identification, which we know is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person:

P(witness identified black) = P(attacker is black | witness identified black) * P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white | witness identified black) * P(attacker is white)

Substituting the given values, we have:

P(witness identified black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.8 * 0.85) * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.105 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.09 = 0.33

Now, we can calculate P(attacker is black | witness identified black) using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness identified black) = P(witness identified black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identified black)

Substituting the values, we have:

P(attacker is black | witness identified black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.27

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.27. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's reliability remains constant in different situations. If the witness's reliability might have been lower at night, the probability of the attacker being black could be lower. Without more information, it's not possible to provide a more precise estimate.
