Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race. However, the witness's error rate is not directly applicable to this specific case, as we don't know if the witness made an error in this instance.

The witness stated that they identified the attacker as black. Since 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can consider this as a "success" for the witness in this case, as they identified the attacker's race as non-majority.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the proportion of the minority population in the city.

{probability: 0.15}
