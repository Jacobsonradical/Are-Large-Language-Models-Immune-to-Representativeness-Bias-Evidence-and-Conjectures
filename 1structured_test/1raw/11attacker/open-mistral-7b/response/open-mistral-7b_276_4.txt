To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that if the witness were making a random guess, they would be incorrect more often than not since they would be guessing against the majority population.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness was correct in this instance:

1. If the attacker was actually white, the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black is 0.2 (the error rate).
2. If the attacker was actually black, the probability that the witness would correctly identify them as black is 0.8 (the correct identification rate).

Since the city is 85% white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness was incorrect (i.e., the attacker is white) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).
