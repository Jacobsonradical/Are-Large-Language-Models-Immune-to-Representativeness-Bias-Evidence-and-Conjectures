To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If the attacker's race is actually black, the witness will correctly identify it as black 80% of the time. If the attacker's race is actually white, the witness will incorrectly identify it as black 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We can write two equations based on the information given:

1. P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 = 0.8 (This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, which is the observed probability in the given scenario.)
2. P(black) = 0.15 (This is the proportion of the population that is black.)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the probability that the attacker is black.

First, let's express the first equation in terms of P(black):

P(black) * 0.8 - 0.2 * P(black) = 0.8 - 0.2 * P(black)
0.6 * P(black) = 0.8
P(black) = 0.8 / 0.6
P(black) = 4/3

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 4/3, which is approximately 0.67. This means that there is a 67% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.
