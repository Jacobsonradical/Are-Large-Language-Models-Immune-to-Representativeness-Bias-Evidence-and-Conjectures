To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. However, we don't know if this error rate is the same for black people as it is for white people. Let's assume for now that the error rate is equal for both races.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white person as black = Error rate * Probability of encountering a white person
                                                                                             = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                                                             = 0.17

Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is:

Probability of witness correctly identifying white person = 1 - Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white person
                                                                                        = 1 - 0.17
                                                                                        = 0.83

The total probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person or incorrectly identifying a black person is:

0.83 (correctly identifying white) + 0.20 (incorrectly identifying black) * 0.15 (probability of encountering a black person)
= 0.83 + 0.03
= 0.86

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person or incorrectly identifying a white person is 0.86, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness correctly identifying black / (Probability of witness correctly identifying black + Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white)
                                                          = 0.20 / 0.86
                                                          â‰ˆ 0.23

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.23 (or 23%). This is a conditional probability, given the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population. If the error rate for identifying black people is higher or lower, or if the racial composition of the city is different, the probability would be different.
