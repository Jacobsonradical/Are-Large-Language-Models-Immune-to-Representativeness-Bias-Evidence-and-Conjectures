To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(H|E): The posterior probability of the attacker being black given the evidence
- P(E|~H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(~H) = 0.85
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (given that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (given that the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, given the evidence, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
