Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness is able to correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In this case, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, but we don't know the actual race of the attacker.
3. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can assume that the witness's error rate applies to both races (white and black) equally.
5. If the witness's error rate is 20%, then when the witness sees a white person, they will mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.
6. Since 85% of the population is white, the number of times the witness sees a white person and mistakenly identifies them as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.
7. Since the attacker was incorrectly identified as black, and this error occurs 17% of the time for white people, it suggests that the attacker might be white.
8. However, we must also consider the possibility that the attacker is black and the witness made an error.
9. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, and the city's population is 15% black, the number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.
10. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, is the ratio of the number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person to the total number of times the witness makes an error, which is 0.12 / (0.17 + 0.12) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41 or 41%.

Answer: {probability: 0.41, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
