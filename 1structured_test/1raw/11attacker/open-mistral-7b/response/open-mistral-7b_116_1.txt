Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts: the actual probability of the attacker being black in the city, and the probability of the witness misidentifying a white attacker as black.

1. The probability of the attacker being black in the city is:
   {probability: 0.15}

2. The probability of the witness misidentifying a white attacker as black is:
   Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, and half of the people are white, the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is:
   {probability: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1}

Now, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in this case. The witness identified the attacker as black, but if the attacker was actually white, there would be a 0.1 chance that the witness misidentifies him/her as black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white and the witness misidentified him/her as black is:
   {probability: 0.85 * 0.1 = 0.085}

The total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probability that the attacker is actually black and the probability that the attacker is white but misidentified as black:

   {probability: 0.15 + 0.085 = 0.235}

So, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23.5%. This estimate takes into account the witness's error rate and the racial distribution in the city.
