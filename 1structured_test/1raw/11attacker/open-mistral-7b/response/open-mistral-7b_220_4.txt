Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given by the witness's accuracy: 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (given by the witness's error rate: 0.2)
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (given by the city's demographics: 85% or 0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(A|B) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Performing the calculations, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
