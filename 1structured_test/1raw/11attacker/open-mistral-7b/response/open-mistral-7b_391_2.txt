To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a method for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E | H)):

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies races 20% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So, P(E | H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)):

From the given information, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the evidence (P(E)):

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8. And given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15. So, P(E) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(H | E)):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12 = 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.667 or 66.7%.
