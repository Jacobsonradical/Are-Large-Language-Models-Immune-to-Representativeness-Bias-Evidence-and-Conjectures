To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) and the probability of a false negative (identifying a black person as white).

The probability of a false positive is the probability of picking a white person and having the witness incorrectly identify them as black. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of picking a white person is 0.85. The probability of a false positive is then 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

The probability of a false negative is the probability of picking a black person and having the witness incorrectly identify them as white. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of picking a black person is 0.15. The probability of a false negative is then 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03.

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was actually white, this would be a false positive, which happens with a probability of 0.17. If the attacker was actually black, this would be a correct identification, which happens with a probability of 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a correct identification divided by the sum of the probabilities of a correct identification and a false positive: 0.97 / (0.97 + 0.17) = 0.84.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.84, or 84%.
