To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally likely to be either identifying a black person as white or a white person as black, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person. Since there are more whites in the city (85%), it's more likely that the witness's mistake would be misidentifying a black person as white.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is lower than 80%. To find this probability, we can subtract the probability of the witness's error from 1:

1 - probability of error = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

However, this does not take into account the racial composition of the city. Since 15% of the city's population is black, we would expect that about 15% of the people the witness sees would be black. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black should be closer to 15% than 80%.

So, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker is black would be somewhere between 15% and 80%, but closer to 15%.
