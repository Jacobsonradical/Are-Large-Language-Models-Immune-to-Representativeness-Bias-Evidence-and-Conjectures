To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black even if the attacker was white. We'll call this the "false positive" rate.

The witness incorrectly identifies someone as black 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. This is the "true positive" rate. Since the attacker's race is unknown, we can't directly calculate this probability. However, we do know that the population is 85% white and 15% black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is P(B) * 0.80.

Since the witness also incorrectly identifies someone as black 17% of the time, we can write the total probability of identifying someone as black (either correctly or incorrectly) as P(B) * 0.80 + 0.17.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, which is P(B) * 0.80.

We can write the equation for the total probability of identifying someone as black:

0.85 * 0.17 + P(B) * 0.80 = 0.15 (since the actual attacker is black 15% of the time)

Solving for P(B) gives us:

P(B) = (0.15 - 0.146) / 0.080 â‰ˆ 0.125 or 12.5%

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual attacker's race. If the witness is more likely to make an error when the attacker is white, this calculation may underestimate the probability that the attacker is black.

In summary, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12.5%. This estimate is sensitive to the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual attacker's race. If this assumption is not valid, the estimated probability may need to be adjusted accordingly.
