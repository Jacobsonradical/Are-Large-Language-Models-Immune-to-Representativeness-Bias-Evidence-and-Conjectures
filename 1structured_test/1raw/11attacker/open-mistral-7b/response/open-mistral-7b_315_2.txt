To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly by the victim, we can assume that the witness's identification is an error. The probability of this error being a misidentification of the attacker as black is the witness's error rate.

Given the racial composition of the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. The probability of the witness erring and misidentifying a white person as black is therefore 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness's error rate is higher for misidentifying whites as blacks than for misidentifying blacks as whites (given the racial composition of the city), the probability of the witness's error being a misidentification of the attacker as black is lower than 17%.

However, without more information, we cannot provide a precise estimate. A conservative estimate would be to assume that the probability of the witness's error being a misidentification of the attacker as black is equal to the witness's error rate for misidentifying whites as blacks, which is 0.17.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.17, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate for misidentifying blacks as whites is lower than 0.17, but without more information, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.
