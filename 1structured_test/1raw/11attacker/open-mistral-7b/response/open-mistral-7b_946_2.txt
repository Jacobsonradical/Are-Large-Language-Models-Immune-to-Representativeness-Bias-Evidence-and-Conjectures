To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's race when they are actually white is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, and the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's race when they are actually black is 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can construct a probability tree as follows:

- If the attacker is white, the probability of being misidentified as black is 0.2. The probability of this event is P(white) * 0.2.
- If the attacker is black, there is no error in identification. The probability of this event is P(black) * 1.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so we can equate the probabilities of these two events:

P(white) * 0.2 = P(black)

We know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85. Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17%.
