To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's description).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black,
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black,
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black,
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description, which is what we want to find,
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is not black given the witness's description.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B) = 0.15 (from part b)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (from part a)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (from part a)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.06)

Simplifying, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
