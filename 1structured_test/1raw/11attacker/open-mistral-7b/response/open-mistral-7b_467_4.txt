Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Given that we don't have information about the specific situation where the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that it was one of their correct identifications. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this is not the final probability of the attacker's race, as the witness's identification may not be entirely accurate due to the conditions at night. To obtain a more accurate estimate, we would need additional information, such as the probability of a black person being an attacker in the city, or any other factors that might influence the witness's identification.

Therefore, while the witness's identification that the attacker is black has a probability of 0.8, the final probability of the attacker being black would require more information.
