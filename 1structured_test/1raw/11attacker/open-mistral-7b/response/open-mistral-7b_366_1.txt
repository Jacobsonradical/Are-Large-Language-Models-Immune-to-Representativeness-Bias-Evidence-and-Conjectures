Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's define our events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:
- P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black) is unknown, but we can estimate it based on the city's demographics given in point b: P(A) = 0.15 (15%)
- P(B|A) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person) is given in point a: P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black) is also given in point a: P(B|~A) = 0.2
- P(~A) (the probability of the attacker being white, which is the complement of P(A)) is also given in point b: P(~A) = 0.85 (85%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.26

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 26%.
