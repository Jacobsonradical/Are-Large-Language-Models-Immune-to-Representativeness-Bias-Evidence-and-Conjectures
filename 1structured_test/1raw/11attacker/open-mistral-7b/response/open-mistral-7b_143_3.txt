The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define our two events:
- A1: The attacker is black
- A2: The attacker is white

We have two pieces of evidence:
- E1: The witness's identification of the attacker as black
- E2: The general demographics of the city

Let's calculate the probabilities of each event:

P(A1) = Probability of the attacker being black = 15% = 0.15
P(A2) = Probability of the attacker being white = 1 - P(A1) = 0.85

Now let's calculate the likelihood of each event given the evidence:

P(E1|A1) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly, given that the attacker is black = 0.8
P(E1|A2) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white = 0.2 (as in 20% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A1|E1) = [P(E1|A1) * P(A1)] / [P(E1|A1) * P(A1) + P(E1|A2) * P(A2)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A1|E1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:

P(A1|E1) â‰ˆ 0.173

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.3%.
