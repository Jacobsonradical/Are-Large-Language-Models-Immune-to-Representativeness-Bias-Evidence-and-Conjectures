Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's demographics and the witness's reliability.

1. City demographics: The city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. Witness reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate applies to a balanced population (half white and half black). In the actual city's demographics, the witness might have more opportunities to see and correctly identify whites due to their numerical superiority.

Assuming that the witness's error rate remains the same in the real-world scenario, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black. Since the attacker's race is not white, the witness's chance of being wrong when seeing a black person is 20%.

But due to the city's demographics, there's a higher probability that the attacker is white (85%). So, if the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, they must have mistaken a white person for a black one. This error would happen 20% of the time when the witness sees a white person.

Given the city's demographics, the witness sees a white person 85% of the time. So, the probability of the witness making an error and reporting a black attacker when the attacker is actually white is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness did report a black attacker, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

In summary:
{probability: 0.83}
