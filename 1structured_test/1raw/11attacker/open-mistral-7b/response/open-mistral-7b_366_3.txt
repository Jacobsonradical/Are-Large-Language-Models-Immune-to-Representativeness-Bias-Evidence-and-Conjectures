To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial makeup of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(A), and the probability that the witness errs as E = 0.2 (from the information given).

The witness's correct identification rate is 1 - E = 0.8. Given the racial distribution of the city, the proportion of black people is B = 0.15.

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was black, the witness would be correct with probability 0.8. If the attacker was white, the witness would err with probability 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood ratio is:

L = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) / P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) = (0.8) / (0.2) = 4

Applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(A | witness identifies black) = L * P(witness identifies black) / P(witness identifies black | A)
                = 4 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
                = 0.6

So, the probability estimate that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.6, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
