Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker's race 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's mistake is 0.85 (the probability of drawing a white person from the population).

On the other hand, if the attacker is black, the witness would correctly identify the attacker 80% of the time. Since the population is 15% black, the probability of the attacker being black given the correct identification is 0.15 (the probability of drawing a black person from the population).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a correct identification divided by the sum of the probabilities of both correct and incorrect identifications.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.15 / (0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.16 or 16%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.16}
