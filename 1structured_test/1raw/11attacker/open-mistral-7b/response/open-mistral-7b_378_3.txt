To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness, in conditions similar to the night of the attack, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white.

The probability of picking a white person randomly from the city's population is 0.85, and the probability of the witness erring in this case is 0.20. Multiplying these probabilities gives us the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black:

0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. The probability of picking a black person randomly from the city's population is 0.15, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying this person is 0.80. Multiplying these probabilities gives us the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:

0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

The total probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we subtract the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black from the total probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race:

0.29 - 0.17 = 0.12

So, based on the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
