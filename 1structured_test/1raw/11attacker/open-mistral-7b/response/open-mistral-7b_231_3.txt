Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The racial distribution of the city's population, where 85% is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

However, there's an important distinction to make. The first piece of information is about the general population distribution, while the second piece of information is about the witness's reliability in identifying race. The attacker's race was not determined by the general population distribution, but rather by the witness's judgment.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which is incorrect 20% of the time according to their track record. Given that they've made this identification, the probability that they've erred is 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification, would be 1 - the probability of error.

{probability: 0.8, explanation: Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they've erred is 20%. The probability that they've correctly identified the attacker's race is therefore 1 - 0.2 = 0.8}
