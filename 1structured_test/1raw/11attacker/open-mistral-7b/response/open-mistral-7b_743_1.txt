To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, so we can assume that they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness also identified the attacker as black. This means that either the attacker is actually black, or the witness made an error in identifying a white person as black. The probability of the latter is 0.17.

Since we don't have any information suggesting that the witness is more likely to make such an error when the person is white, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification is equal to the probability of the witness making this error: P(white|witness_identification) = 0.17.

Given that the overall probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(black|witness_identification) = P(witness_identification|black) * P(black) / (P(witness_identification|black) * P(black) + P(witness_identification|white) * P(white))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(black|witness_identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 or 41.38%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 41.38%.
