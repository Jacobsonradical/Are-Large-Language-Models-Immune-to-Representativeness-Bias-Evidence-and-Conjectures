To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and there is a 50-50 chance of the attacker being black or white, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as follows:

Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker = Witness's accuracy rate * Probability of attacker being black
                                                                       = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                                       = 0.12

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black when the attacker was actually white. To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error and mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white attacker as black = Witness's error rate * Probability of attacker being white
                                                                                        = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                                                        = 0.17

Since we cannot know for certain which of these two probabilities applies in this case, we must consider both possibilities and take the average. The overall probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the two probabilities divided by 2:

Probability of attacker being black = (Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker + Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white attacker as black) / 2
                                                     = (0.12 + 0.17) / 2
                                                     = 0.145

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.145 or 14.5%.
