To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence: the witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Now we can plug in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get: P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1935

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 19.35%.
