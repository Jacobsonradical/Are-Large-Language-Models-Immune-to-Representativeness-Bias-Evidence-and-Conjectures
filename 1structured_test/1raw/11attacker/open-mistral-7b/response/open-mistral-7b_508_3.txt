To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case, H is "attacker is black" and E is "witness identified attacker as black".

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is "attacker is not black")

We are not given P(E|~H), but we can use the fact that P(E|H) + P(E|~H) = 1 (since the witness is always correct or incorrect) and the information that the witness is correct 80% of the time. This means that P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
