Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness incorrectly identified the race of the attacker, but we don't have that information. However, we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time. Since we don't know if this was one of their errors, we can't directly use this information to estimate the attacker's race.

The witness's correct identification rate of 80% can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black if the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. But given that the witness made an incorrect identification, we cannot use this information directly.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
