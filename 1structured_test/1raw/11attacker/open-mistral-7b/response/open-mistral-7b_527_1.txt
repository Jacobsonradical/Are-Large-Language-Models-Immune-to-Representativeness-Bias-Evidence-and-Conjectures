Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, we have:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (The probability of an attacker being black in the city is 15%)

We need to find P(E), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of whether they are black or not. To do this, we can use the given information on the witness's accuracy and the racial distribution in the city.

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Where:
- ~H: The attacker is not black
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness mistakenly identifies someone as black 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (The probability of an attacker being white in the city is 85%)

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
