Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race. However, we don't know the exact number of attackers the witness encountered in their 50% white and 50% black sample. To make an estimate, we can assume that the witness made as many correct identifications as mistakes (since the error rate is 20%).

Let's denote the number of black people in the witness's sample as B. Since the sample is half white and half black, we can write B = 0.5 * N, where N is the total number of people in the sample.

We know that the witness correctly identified 0.8 * B black people and 0.2 * B white people. Since the total number of correct identifications is equal to the total number of mistakes, we have:

0.8 * B = 0.2 * (N - B)

To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

B = (0.2 * N) / 0.8 = N/4

Now, let's find the probability that the attacker is black. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a random person is white is 0.85. Given that the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person, the probability that the witness mistook a white person for a black one is:

1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since there are four times as many white people as black people in the witness's sample, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a black person as white is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a white person:

P(witness mistakenly identifies black as white) = P(witness correctly identifies white) = 0.2

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race is therefore:

P(witness correctly identifies attacker's race) = P(witness correctly identifies black) = 0.8

Since there are four times as many white people as black people in the sample, the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness mistakenly identifies black as white) = 0.2

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.2.
