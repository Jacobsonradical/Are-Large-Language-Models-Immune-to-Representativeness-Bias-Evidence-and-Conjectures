Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. The attacker's race is unknown, but a witness identified them as black.
3. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A: Attacker is black
- Event B: Witness identifies attacker as black
- P(A) = Probability of attacker being black = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(not A) = Probability of attacker not being black = 0.85
- P(B|A) = Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(B|not A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying non-black attacker as black = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from information a)

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
