To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that tells us how to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

Let's break down these probabilities:

1. P(E|H) is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified black people 80% of the time)
2. P(H) is the probability of the attacker being black. This is what we want to find.
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black. This can be calculated from the total population statistics and the witness's accuracy:

   P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

   Where P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black. This can be calculated from the accuracy of identifying white people and the proportion of whites in the population:

   P(E|not H) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.17

   So P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.17 * 0.85

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * P(H)) / (0.8 * P(H) + 0.17 * 0.85)

To solve for P(H|E), we need to know P(H), which is what we're trying to find. Unfortunately, without more information, we can't determine P(H) directly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the population statistics and the witness's accuracy.

Given that the witness's accuracy is not perfect but is still quite high, and that the population is primarily white, it seems reasonable to assume that the true probability of the attacker being black is lower than 15%. However, without more information, we can't provide a precise numerical estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to strictly answer the question in the requested format. I would recommend consulting a statistician or data scientist for a more accurate estimate.
