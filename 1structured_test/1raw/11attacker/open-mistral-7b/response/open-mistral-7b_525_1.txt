Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population composition of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race, which is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, we must also consider that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as black. This means that the actual race of the attacker could be white, even though the witness misidentified it as black.

The probability of the witness making a mistake in identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is white, is the error rate of 20%. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is white, is the correct rate of 80%.

Since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can consider these two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is white. In this case, the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's race is 20%.

Scenario 2: The attacker is black. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 80%.

Given the population composition of the city, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%), and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

We can now calculate the overall probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker could be either white or black. This is done by weighting the probabilities of each scenario by their respective probabilities and then summing them up:

Probability of correct identification = (Probability of attacker being white * Probability of witness correctly identifying white) + (Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying black)

Substituting the values, we get:

Probability of correct identification = (0.85 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.1)

After performing the calculations, the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given the attacker's race, is approximately 0.61 or 61%.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, and their identification was incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker was white, we can adjust our probability estimate for the attacker being black.

If the witness's identification was incorrect, the actual attacker must be white. So, we can consider the probability of the attacker being black as the complement of the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect, given that the attacker is white:

Probability of attacker being black = 1 - Probability of witness's identification being incorrect, given attacker is white

Substituting the values, we get:

Probability of attacker being black = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, given the witness's identification and their reliability, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
