Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person as the attacker.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15). The probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker given that the attacker is black is given as 80% (0.8).

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as the attacker given that the attacker is white is given as 20% (0.2), and the prior probability of the attacker being white is given as 85% (0.85).

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker, regardless of the attacker's race, is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black. This is given as 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26.

Applying Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26
        â‰ˆ 0.385

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is about 38.5%.
