To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, it's likely that the attacker is actually white.

Let's calculate the probability of this error. The probability of picking a white person at random is 0.85, and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (the error rate). Therefore, the probability of a witness error given a white person is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of a correct identification given a white person is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68.

Similarly, the probability of picking a black person at random is 0.15, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8. Therefore, the probability of a correct identification given a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The overall probability of a correct identification by the witness is the sum of these probabilities, which is 0.68 + 0.12 = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of a correct identification given a black person, which is 0.12.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12}.
