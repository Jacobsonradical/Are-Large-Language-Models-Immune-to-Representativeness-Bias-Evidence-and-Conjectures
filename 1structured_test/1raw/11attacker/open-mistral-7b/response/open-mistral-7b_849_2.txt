To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen, the only relevant information is the witness's error rate. If we assume that the witness's erroneous identifications are equally likely to result in misidentifying a black person as white and vice versa, then the witness's error rate can be interpreted as the probability that the witness errs in identifying a person's race.

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85 and the probability that they are black is 0.15.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is due to an error is 0.20. This means that the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's identification, is 0.20.

Since the overall probability that a person is white is 0.85, the probability that a person is white, given that the witness errs, is the probability of erring times the probability of being white: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of not erring times the probability of being black: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
