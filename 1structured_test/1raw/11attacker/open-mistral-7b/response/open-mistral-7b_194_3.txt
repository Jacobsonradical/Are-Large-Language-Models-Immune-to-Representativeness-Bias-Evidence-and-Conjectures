Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is either white or black. We can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification for each race.

The total population is 100%. So, 85% is white, and 15% is black. The witness correctly identifies 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (68%).

Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. So, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification for a black person, given that they identified the attacker as black.

This probability can be calculated as the probability of the witness making a correct identification for a black person divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification for both white and black people.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.12 / (0.68 + 0.12) = 0.15 (15%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.
