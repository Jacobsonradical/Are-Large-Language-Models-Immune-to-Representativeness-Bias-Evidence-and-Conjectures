Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time.
2. The proportion of black people in the city is 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker is black) based on new evidence (the witness's description).

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case:
- H is the attacker is black
- E is the witness's description of the attacker

We are given the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

However, we don't have direct information about P(E), the probability of the witness's description given any race. But we can infer it from the given information.

If P(E|H) = 0.8, then P(E|not H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time).

Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, and given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can infer that P(E|white) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 32% of the time).

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
    = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.68 * 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.57
    = 0.69

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
    = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.69
    â‰ˆ 0.14

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.14 or 14%. This estimate is lower than the actual proportion of black people in the city due to the witness's error rate.
