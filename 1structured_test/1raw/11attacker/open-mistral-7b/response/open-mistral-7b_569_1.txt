To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, but errs 20% of the time. Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black and attributing the crime to a black person.

Let's denote the probability of a random person being white as p (since we know that p = 0.85), and the probability of a random person being black as q (with q = 0.15). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is then p * (1 - 0.8) = 0.165 (16.5%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that either the attacker is indeed black or the witness made an error. The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is then the probability of the attacker being black minus the probability of the witness making an error:

Q = q - p * (1 - 0.8)
Q = 0.15 - 0.85 * 0.2
Q = 0.15 - 0.17
Q = 0.005 (0.5%)

However, we made an error in our calculation of the probability of the witness making an error. Since the witness correctly identifies a random person's race 80% of the time, the actual probability of a white person being identified as black is less than 16.5% and more than 0%.

Let's denote the actual probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black as e (with e < 0.165). The probability of the attacker being black then becomes:

Q = q - p * (1 - 0.8) * (1 - e)
Q = 0.15 - 0.85 * 0.2 * (1 - e)
Q = 0.15 - 0.14 * (1 - e)
Q = 0.15 * (1 + 0.14/0.85) * (1 - e)
Q = 0.15 * (1.1689) * (1 - e)

Unfortunately, without knowing the value of e, we cannot provide a specific numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. However, we can say that the probability is greater than 0.15 and less than 0.15 * 1.1689. If we assume the worst-case scenario and take the lower limit of this interval, then the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.17. If we assume the best-case scenario and take the upper limit of this interval, then the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.18.
