Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote the hypothesis H as "The attacker is black," and the evidence E as "The witness identified the attacker as black."

We are given two pieces of prior information:
1. The probability of H (P(H)) is unknown, but we can estimate it based on the city's demographics. Since 15% of the population is black, we can assume that P(H) = 0.15.
2. The probability of E given H (P(E|H)) is given by the witness's ability to correctly identify race. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. The probability of E given not H (P(E|~H)) is 1 minus the probability of correctly identifying a black person when the person is actually white. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, they err in 20% of the cases when the person is white. Therefore, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white) = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85] = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
