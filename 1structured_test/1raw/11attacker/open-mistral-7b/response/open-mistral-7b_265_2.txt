To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the information given and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probabilistic formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (85% of the population is black, so P(B) = 0.85)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given in the text, P(W|B) = 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (given in the text, P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (1 - P(B) = 0.15)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.85] / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15]

Calculating this, we find that P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.72

Therefore, based on the given information and assuming the witness's ability to judge race is representative of that night, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.72 (or 72%).
