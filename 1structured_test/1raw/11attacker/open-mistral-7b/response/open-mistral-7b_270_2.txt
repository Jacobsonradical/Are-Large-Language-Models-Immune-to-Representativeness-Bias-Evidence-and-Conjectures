To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(A). We also know that the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is P(W|B) = 0.2 (given in the question), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is P(W|B') = 0.8.

Since the attacker's race is not visible to the victim, the probability of the witness seeing a white person (regardless of the attacker's race) is P(W) = 0.85 (given in the question).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|B') * P(B')]

Plugging in the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
