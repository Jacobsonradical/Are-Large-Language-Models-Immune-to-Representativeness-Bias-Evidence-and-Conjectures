To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means the probability that the witness was incorrect (and the attacker is actually white) is 20%.

On the other hand, the city's racial demographics suggest that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. If the attacker is actually white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black is lower than the 20% error rate, since the witness is more likely to correctly identify a white person (given their higher frequency in the population).

However, without specific information about the witness's error rate when identifying white people, we cannot calculate this probability precisely. Therefore, we can only estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the overall error rate of the witness.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
