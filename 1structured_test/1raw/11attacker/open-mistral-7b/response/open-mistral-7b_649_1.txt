To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about events based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race.
- ~A as the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).
- ~W as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race.

The witness's statement "I saw a black person" can be interpreted as either:
- W and A (the witness correctly identified a black person as the attacker)
or
- ~W and ~A (the witness incorrectly identified a white person as the attacker)

Since the witness didn't see the attacker's face, we can assume that the probability of the witness making a correct or incorrect identification is independent of whether the attacker is black or white. In other words, P(W|A) = P(W|~A).

From the information provided, we know:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(~A) = 0.85
3. P(W) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
4. P(~W) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Given that P(W|A) = P(W|~A), we can simplify the equation:

P(A|W) = P(A) / [P(A) + P(~A) * (1 - P(W))]

Plugging in the values from our initial information, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.15 / [0.15 + 0.85 * (1 - 0.8)]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.29, or 29%.
