Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err in 20% of their judgments. Since we don't have any other information about this specific case, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker's race was judged according to the witness's usual accuracy rate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, according to the witness's testimony, would be 0.8 (80%).

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the provided information. In reality, there might be other factors influencing the witness's judgment that were not considered in this analysis. For instance, the lighting conditions, the distance between the witness and the attacker, or the presence of other distinguishing features could all affect the witness's ability to accurately determine the attacker's race. Without considering these factors, this estimate should be viewed as a rough approximation.

In summary, {probability: 0.8} is an estimate based on the witness's reported accuracy rate in judging race, but other factors might change this probability in reality.
