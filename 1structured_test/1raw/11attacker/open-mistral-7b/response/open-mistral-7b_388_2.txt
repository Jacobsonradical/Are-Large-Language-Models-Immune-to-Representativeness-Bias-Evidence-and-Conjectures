To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's description).

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- E: the witness described the attacker as black

The probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black people, which is 0.8 (from the first piece of information). So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is the witness's error rate for identifying black people as white, which is 0.2 (also from the first piece of information). So, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city. From the second piece of information, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

The prior probability of the attacker being white is the proportion of white people in the city. From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white. So, P(~H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, our estimate is that there is a 12% probability that the attacker is black. This means there is an 88% probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's description.
