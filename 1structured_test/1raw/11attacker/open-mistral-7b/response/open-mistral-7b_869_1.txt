Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim, so we can assume that the witness's identification is an error. Since the error rate is 20%, the probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black is 0.20.

However, the witness's error rate does not account for the fact that the city's population is predominantly white (85%). To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given the city's demographics.

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population), and the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85% of the population). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker as black is 0.20, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker as white is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0, since a white attacker cannot be mistakenly identified as black.

Given these probabilities, the probability of the witness making an error (identifying a black attacker as black or a white attacker as black) is 0.20 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.03 (or 3%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 / 0.97 = 0.155, or approximately 15.5%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's error rate and the city's demographics.
