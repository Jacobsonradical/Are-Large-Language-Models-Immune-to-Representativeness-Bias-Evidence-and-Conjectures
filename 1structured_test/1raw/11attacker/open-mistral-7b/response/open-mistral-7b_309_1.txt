To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to distinguish between the witness's false positives (identifying a white person as black) and false negatives (identifying a black person as white).

Let's assume for simplicity that the witness errs equally in both directions (this is an overestimation of the attacker's true probability, as the witness is more likely to misidentify a minority in this case). In this scenario, the probability of a false positive is 20% and the probability of a false negative is also 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%). This means that the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white is also 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the actual probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probability of a black person being correctly identified and the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white: 0.8 * 0.15 (where 0.8 is the reliability of the witness) + 0.17 = 0.228 (22.8%).

However, since we assumed equal error rates, this is an overestimation. In reality, the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white is likely lower than 17%, and the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black is likely higher. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is likely lower than 22.8%.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is likely between 0.17 (17%) and 0.228 (22.8%), with 0.228 (22.8%) being an overestimate. However, without more specific information about the witness's error rates, a precise estimate cannot be provided.

{probability: 0.17 to 0.228, note: this range is an estimate based on the given information, and a precise estimate would require more specific information about the witness's error rates}
