To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness is equally likely to err in identifying either race (white or black), then the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white is the same as the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8. Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, the information we have suggests that the witness's errors are not balanced between the two races. The witness is more likely to err in identifying a black person as white than the other way around, as shown by the witness's error rate.

Therefore, we should adjust our probabilities based on the witness's error rate. Since the witness errs in identifying a black person as white 20% of the time, the actual probability of the attacker being black should be higher than the 12% calculated above.

To find the actual probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identifies black)

We are given P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8, P(attacker is black) = 0.15, and P(witness identifies black) = P(witness identifies white) = 0.5 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.5) = 0.24

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.24 or 24%.
