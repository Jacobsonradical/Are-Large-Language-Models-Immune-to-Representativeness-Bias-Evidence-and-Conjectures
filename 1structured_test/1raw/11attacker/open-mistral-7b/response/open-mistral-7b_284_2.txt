To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black),
- E is the evidence (witness identification and population demographics),
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability (probability of the attacker being black given the evidence),
- P(E|H) is the likelihood (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black),
- P(H) is the prior probability (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence),
- P(E) is the marginal likelihood (total probability of the evidence, regardless of the attacker's race).

We have the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (population demographics show 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  where P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, and P(not H) is the probability of the attacker being white (1 - 0.15 = 0.85). Since we don't have information about P(E|not H), we can't directly compute P(E).

However, we can approximate P(E) by considering the error rate of the witness. Since the witness correctly identifies people 80% of the time, they must err 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the attacker is more likely to be white than black. Therefore, it's more likely that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black than a black person as white. Let's assume that the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 25% of the time (this is just an assumption, as we don't have enough information to accurately calculate this value).

So, P(E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.25 * 0.85 = 0.1735

Using this approximation, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.1735 ≈ 0.288

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.288 or 28.8%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's ability to identify race and the demographics of the city. However, it's important to note that the approximation for P(E) is based on an assumption, and a more accurate calculation would require more information.
