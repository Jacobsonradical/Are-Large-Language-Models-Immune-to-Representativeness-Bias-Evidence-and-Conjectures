Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% (correctly identifying black people 80% of the time).
3. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness made an error 20% of the time when identifying white people as black (since the total error rate is 20%).
4. Since the witness's error rate is not specified for identifying black people as white, we cannot make any assumptions about it. Therefore, we cannot adjust the 15% probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's error rate.
5. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being black is the actual population percentage, which is 15%.

So, the probability estimate is: {probability: 0.15}
