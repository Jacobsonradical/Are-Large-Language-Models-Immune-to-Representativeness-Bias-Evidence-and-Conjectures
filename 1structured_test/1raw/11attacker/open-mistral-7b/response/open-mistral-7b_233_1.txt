Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to correctly identify race was 80% and the error rate was 20%.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(B). The probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, and the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The witness's overall error rate is 0.2. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black (given the witness's statement) is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black and the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

So, P(B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.412, or approximately 41.2%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.412} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
