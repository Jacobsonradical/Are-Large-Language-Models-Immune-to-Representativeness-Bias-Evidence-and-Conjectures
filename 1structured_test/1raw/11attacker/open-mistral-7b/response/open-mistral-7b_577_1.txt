To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, in this case, we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness's error occurred when they misidentified a black person as white or vice versa. Let's assume that the erroneous identifications are evenly distributed between the two races for the sake of simplicity.

According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. If the witness's error rate is 20%, then the probability of a correct identification is 1 - error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker:

Probability of witness identifying black attacker as black = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying black person

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8.

The probability of the attacker being black is given by the racial demographics of the city: 0.15 or 15%.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is:

0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

However, since we don't know whether the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races, this calculation might be an overestimate. If the witness's errors disproportionately favor misidentifying black people as white, the actual probability could be lower.

Therefore, while we can't provide a definitive probability, based on the given information, a conservative estimate would be around 12%.
