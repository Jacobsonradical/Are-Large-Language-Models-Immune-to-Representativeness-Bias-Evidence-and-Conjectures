Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, due to the lack of direct evidence about the attacker's race, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black.

We can only make an estimate based on the witness's reliability. If we assume that the witness's mistake rate is evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying a black person as white and an incorrectly identifying a white person as black, then the probability of the witness making a mistake in this case is 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that the probability that the attacker is actually black is higher than the 85% white population proportion. However, we cannot determine the exact probability without more information.

So, while it's likely that the attacker is black, we cannot provide a precise probability without more evidence. As such, I would refrain from providing a numerical estimate in this case.
