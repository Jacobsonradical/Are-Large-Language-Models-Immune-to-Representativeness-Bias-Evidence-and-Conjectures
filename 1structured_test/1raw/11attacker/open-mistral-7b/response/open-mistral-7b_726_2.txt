Given the information provided, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the population statistics alone. However, we can make an educated guess.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, but this does not necessarily mean that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct. We need to consider the possibility that the actual attacker was white and the witness mistakenly identified them as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can infer that in 17% of cases where the witness sees a white person, they will mistakenly identify them as black. This means that the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black is 0.17.

Now, let's assume that the attacker was actually white. In this case, the witness would have a 17% chance of mistakenly identifying them as black. Since the witness actually identified the attacker as black, this means that either the attacker is actually black (with probability 1 - 0.17 = 0.83) or the witness made a mistake (with probability 0.17).

However, we have no direct evidence that the witness made a mistake in this case. Therefore, the most conservative estimate would be to assume that the witness's identification is correct, which means that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.83.

In summary, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83. This estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's identification is correct, but it does not account for potential biases or errors in the witness's testimony. A more thorough investigation would be needed to obtain a more accurate estimate.
