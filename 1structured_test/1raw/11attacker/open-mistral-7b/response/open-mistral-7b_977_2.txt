Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H) is the prior probability of H, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of E given H, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(E|~H) is the likelihood of E given not-H, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black
- P(~H) is the prior probability of ~H, which is the probability that the attacker is not black before considering any evidence

From the information provided, we know P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2. We also know that P(H) = P(~H), because the total probability of all possible outcomes must be 1. Since 85% of the population is white, we can estimate P(~H) as 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this expression, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.333

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 33.3%.
