To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. This means that in 20% of the cases, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

On the other hand, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3%.

Since the witness's mistake rate is higher for white people, the attacker being misidentified as black is more likely if the attacker is white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is lower than the actual proportion of black people in the city.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is less than 15%. A precise calculation would require more information, such as the specific error rates in each race, but based on the given information, we can estimate that the probability is less than 0.15.
