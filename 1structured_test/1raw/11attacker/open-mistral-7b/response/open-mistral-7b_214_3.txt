Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the accuracy of the witness in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the witness's identification of the attacker as black:

- If the attacker is actually black, then the witness's identification is correct.
- If the attacker is white, then the witness is likely to mistakenly identify the attacker as black (given the witness's error rate of 20%).

The probability of the attacker being black can be estimated by considering both scenarios:

1. Probability of the attacker being black and the witness's identification being correct: 15% (proportion of blacks in the city) * 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) = 0.12
2. Probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black: 85% (proportion of whites in the city) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

The total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker (either correctly or mistakenly) is the sum of the above two probabilities:

probability = 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (mistaken identification) = 0.29

The estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
