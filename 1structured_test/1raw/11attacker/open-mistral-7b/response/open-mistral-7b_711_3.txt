To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification, and the event we are interested in is the attacker's race.

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the witness's statement)
- P(E|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~A) as the probability of the attacker not being black

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(E|A) = 0.8, and P(E|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time).

We also know that P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A). We can use this equation to find P(E), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race.

Let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
     = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.1775
     = 0.2975

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2975
       â‰ˆ 0.243

So, based on the witness's statement, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.243 or 24.3%.
