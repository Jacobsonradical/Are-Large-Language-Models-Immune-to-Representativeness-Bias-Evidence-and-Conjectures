Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the population statistics, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race under similar conditions, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(B|A) (the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- P(B|~A) (the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from the witness's inaccuracy and the population statistics)
- P(~B|A) (the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as not black, given that the attacker is black) = 0.2
- P(~B|~A) (the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as not black, given that the attacker is not black) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / [P(B)]
                 = 0.12 / P(B)

However, we cannot directly calculate P(B) from the given information. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to express P(B) in terms of P(A|B) and the other probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
                 = 0.12 + 0.15
                 = 0.27

Substituting P(B) into the equation for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
                 = (0.12) / 0.27
                 = 0.448

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.448 or 44.8%.
