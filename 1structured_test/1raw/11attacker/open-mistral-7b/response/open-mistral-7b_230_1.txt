Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, used to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "The attacker is black," and the evidence is "The witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (the hypothesis)
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is black)
P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person (given that the attacker is not black)
P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (the complementary hypothesis)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person (without knowing the actual race of the attacker)

We are given:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to identify black people)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to identify white people)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Substituting the given values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1775 = 0.2975

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.2975 â‰ˆ 0.265

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.265 or 26.5%.
