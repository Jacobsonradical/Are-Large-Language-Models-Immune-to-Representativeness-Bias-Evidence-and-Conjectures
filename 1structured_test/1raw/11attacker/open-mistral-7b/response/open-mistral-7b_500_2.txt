Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black (from point A). However, a witness identified the attacker as black (point B). The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect (point B).

Since we cannot assume that the witness always correctly identifies the attacker's race, we need to consider both the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the actual probability of the attacker being black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is indeed black is P(black) * 0.8 (given the witness's accuracy of 80%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 (given the witness's error rate of 20%).

The witness identified the attacker as black. So, we have the equation:

P(black) * 0.8 = probability_witness_identified_correctly

(1 - P(black)) * 0.2 = probability_witness_identified_incorrectly

The witness identified the attacker as black. So, the sum of these probabilities should equal 1:

P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 = 1

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we can solve for P(black) in the equation above:

P(black) = (1 - 0.2) / (0.8 - 0.2 * P(black))

By simplifying and solving this equation, we find that P(black) â‰ˆ 0.615.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.615.
