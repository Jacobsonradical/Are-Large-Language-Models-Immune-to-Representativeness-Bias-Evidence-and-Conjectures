To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observed evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- Ā: The attacker is not black (i.e., white)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black

According to the given information, we have two probabilities:
1. P(E|A) = 0.8: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8.
2. P(E|Ā) = 0.2: The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2.
3. P(A) = p: The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
4. P(Ā) = 1 - p: The prior probability of the attacker being white.

The population distribution gives us the prior probabilities P(A) and P(Ā):
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(Ā) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the result:

P(A|E) ≈ 0.18

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18%.
