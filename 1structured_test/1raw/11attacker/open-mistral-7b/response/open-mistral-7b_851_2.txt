To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black,
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black,
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified a black person (this is what we want to find),
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is not black, given that the witness identified a black person.

From the information given, we know:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the known values:
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we get:
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.1818

So, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18.18%.
