To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the event times the prior probability of the event. Mathematically, this can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, which is given as 0.8.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, which is the sum of the probability of identifying a black attacker and the probability of mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black.

We are given that the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since there are equal numbers of white and black people (half and half), the probability of a random person being white is 0.5 and the probability of being black is 0.5. The probability of the witness identifying a random person as black is therefore 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4 and the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

So, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), is given as 0.15 (from information b).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
         = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.5
         = 0.12

So, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
