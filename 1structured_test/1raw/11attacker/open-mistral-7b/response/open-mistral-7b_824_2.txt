To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, since we don't know if the witness erred in this specific case, we must use the probability of making a correct identification to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8 (or 80%), and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (or 20%).

Given that we don't have any other information, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is the same as the probability of the witness making a correct identification. So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.

Therefore, {probability: 0.8}
