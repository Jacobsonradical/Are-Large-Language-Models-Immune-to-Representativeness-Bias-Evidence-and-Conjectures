To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

The probability of the first event (the attacker is black) is the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (from the witness's performance).

The probability of the second event (the attacker is white) is the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is the probability of the witness's error, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

So, the probability of the second event is 0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) = 0.17.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the first event divided by the sum of the probabilities of both events:

{probability: 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17) = 0.8 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.82}

In other words, given the witness's identification, there is an estimated probability of approximately 0.82 that the attacker is black.
