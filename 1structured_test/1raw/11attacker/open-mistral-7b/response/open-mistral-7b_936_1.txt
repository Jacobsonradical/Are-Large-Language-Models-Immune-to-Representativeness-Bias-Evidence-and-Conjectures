To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (80% chance of correctly identifying a black person)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

The prior probability, P(H), is not provided in the information we have, so we'll make an assumption for this calculation. Let's assume that before any evidence, we believe that the attacker is equally likely to be black or white, which means P(H) = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate P(E|H) from the information provided:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

The probability of the evidence, P(E), can be calculated using the total population statistics provided:

P(E) = 0.15 * P(E|H) + 0.85 * P(E|~H)

Here, P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person, which we don't have. But we can assume that the witness is as good at identifying races as before, so P(E|~H) = 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.5)] / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.8)]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.66 (or 66%)

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66%.
