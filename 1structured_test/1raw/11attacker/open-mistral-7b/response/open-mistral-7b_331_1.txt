To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we first need to understand the reliability of the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the population.

From the information given, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness says a person is black, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are wrong.

The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's consider the two possibilities:
1. The witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black. In this case, the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness is incorrect in identifying the attacker as black. In this case, the attacker is white.

The probability of the first event (witness is correct) is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the second event (witness is incorrect) is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the attacker is black and the witness is correct, the attacker's race does not change, so the probability of the attacker being black in this case is 1 (certainty).

However, given that the attacker is white and the witness is incorrect, the attacker's race changes from black to white. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black is 0 (impossibility).

So, the probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness being correct multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness is correct, minus the probability of the witness being incorrect multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness is incorrect:

{probability: 0.8 * 1 - 0.2 * 0 = 0.8}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%). This means that, according to the information given, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is black.
