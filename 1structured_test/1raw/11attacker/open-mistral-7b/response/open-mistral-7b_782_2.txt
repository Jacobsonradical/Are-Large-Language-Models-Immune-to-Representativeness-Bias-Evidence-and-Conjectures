Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any direct information about the attacker's race. The witness's statement that the attacker is black is an error in this context.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, we can assume that the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black than the other way around, given the city's demographics.

Therefore, it would be reasonable to estimate that the actual probability of the attacker being black is lower than the witness's statement, given the witness's error rate and the city's demographics.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate in this format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.

A more precise estimate would require additional information, such as the probability of the witness making a false positive error (mistakenly identifying a black person as white) and the probability of the witness making a false negative error (failing to identify a black person as black). With those probabilities, it would be possible to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.
