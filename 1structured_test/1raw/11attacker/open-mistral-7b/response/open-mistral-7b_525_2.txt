Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (from information b).
2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (from information a).
3. P(E): The probability of the witness making any identification at all is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person. Since she correctly identifies half the time and incorrectly identifies the other half, this probability is 0.5.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.12

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified calculation and real-world scenarios may require more complex considerations.
