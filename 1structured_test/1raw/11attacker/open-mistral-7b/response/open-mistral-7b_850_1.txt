To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the demographic distribution of races in the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. According to the demographic information provided (piece "a"), 15% of the city's population is black.

2. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify races is not perfect (piece "b"). The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. Let's denote:

- E: The event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
- I: The event that the attacker is actually black.
- O: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know that P(E) = 0.8 (80%) and P(I) = 0.15 (15%). We want to find P(O|I), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write P(O|I) as:

P(O|I) = P(I|O) * P(O) / P(I)

According to the witness's reliability, P(I|O) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate P(O|I) directly.

However, we can provide an upper bound for P(O|I) based on the witness's reliability. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the maximum probability that the witness is right when she identifies a black person as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, an upper bound for P(O|I) is 0.8 (the maximum probability the witness is right), which means that there is at most an 80% chance that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black.

Therefore, the strict answer to the question is:

{probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
