Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  P(E|not H) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time)
  P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

Calculating P(E):
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.12) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
