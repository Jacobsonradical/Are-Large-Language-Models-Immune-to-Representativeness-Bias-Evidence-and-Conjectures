To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
P(B|A) = Witness's accuracy in identifying black people = 0.8
P(A) = Probability of the attacker being black = P(we want to find)
P(B|not A) = Witness's error rate in identifying non-black people = 0.2
P(not A) = Probability of the attacker being non-black = 1 - P(A)

Now we can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(B|A) and P(B|not A), and we can find P(not A) from the total population's racial composition:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can plug these values into the equation and solve for P(A):

P(A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. However, it is important to note that this estimate relies on the assumption that the witness's accuracy in identifying races remains constant in different contexts, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be treated as an approximation and not as a definitive probability.
