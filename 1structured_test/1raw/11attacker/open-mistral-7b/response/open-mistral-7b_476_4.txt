Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, has identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black. If the attacker is indeed black, the witness's identification is correct. However, if the attacker is white, there's a chance that the witness might mistake him for black due to poor visibility or other factors.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 (since there's a 0.85 probability of the attacker being white).

So, the total probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker or erroneously identifying a white attacker as black is 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

However, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness has identified him as black. This is the inverse probability of the witness's statement, which can be calculated as the probability of the witness making such a statement if the attacker is black divided by the total probability of the witness making such a statement:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness identifying black attacker / Total probability of witness's statement

= 0.8 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.8164

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8164 or 81.64%.
