To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the composition of the population in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness will mistakenly identify them as black is 0.2 (20%).

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, we also know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than the 12% that the witness correctly identified.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 17% of the time, we can assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is somewhere between the 12% that the witness correctly identified and the 17% that the witness incorrectly identified.

Therefore, while we cannot provide a precise number, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 12% but less than 17%.

{probability: between 0.12 and 0.17, with a stronger lean towards 0.17}
