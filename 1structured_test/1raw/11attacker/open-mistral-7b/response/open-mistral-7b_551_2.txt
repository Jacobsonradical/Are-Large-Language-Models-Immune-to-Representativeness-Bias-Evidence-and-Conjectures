Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker being specifically white, we can assume that the witness's observation of the attacker being "black" could be an accurate identification or an error.

Let's calculate the probabilities of both events:

1. The attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies the race: Probability = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12

2. The attacker is black and the witness makes an error: Probability = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.03

3. The attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies the race: Since we don't have any information about the attacker being specifically white, we cannot calculate this probability.

However, given that the attacker's race is either black or white, we can calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

Total probability = Probability of attacker being black and correct identification + Probability of attacker being black and error + Probability of attacker being white and incorrect identification

We cannot calculate the third probability, so we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information. It is important to note that the witness's identification should be considered as one piece of evidence among others, and a thorough investigation would be required to establish the attacker's race with certainty.
