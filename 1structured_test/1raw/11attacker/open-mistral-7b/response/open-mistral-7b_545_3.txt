Given the two pieces of information provided, the population data (a) suggests that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. However, a witness has reported the attacker as black (b). The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the incorrect identification rate is 20%.

Since the witness's accuracy is lower than the actual population distribution, it's likely that the witness might have made an error in this case as well. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's report,
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness reporting "black" given that the attacker is black,
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, and
- P(B) is the probability of the witness reporting "black" in the population.

Using the given information, we can assume that P(A) = 0.15 (the population proportion of black people), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people).

To find P(B), we can use the concept of conditional probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness reporting "black" given that the attacker is not black, and P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being black (which is 0.85).

Since we don't have information about P(B|not A), we can't calculate P(B) directly. However, we can use the witness's overall accuracy of 0.8 to estimate P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Then, P(not A) = 0.85, and we can use the given information to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.625

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 62.5%.
