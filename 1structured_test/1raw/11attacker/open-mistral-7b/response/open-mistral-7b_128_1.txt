Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and makes errors 20% of the time.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's break down this problem:

1. Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we can't directly use the witness's statement as evidence.
2. However, we do know the overall racial composition of the city.
3. If we assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population, we can use the city's racial distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

The probability of an event happening is the number of ways it can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and there are two possible outcomes (black or white).

So, the probability of the attacker being black (P(black)) is:

P(black) = Number of black people / Total number of people

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the total number of people is 1 (100%). So, the number of black people is 0.15, and the number of white people is 0.85.

P(black) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15

Since we cannot use the witness's statement due to lack of information, the best estimate we can make based on the available data is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.15.

{probability: 0.15}
