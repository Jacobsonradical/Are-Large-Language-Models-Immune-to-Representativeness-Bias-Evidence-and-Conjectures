Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is random (which might not be the case in reality, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity), we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%). If the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, the witness made an identification, which means their guess was either correct or incorrect. If the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race, we want to know the probability of this happening. The probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.12, and the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect given that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

Since the witness made an identification, the probability of this being correct is the sum of the probability of being correct and the probability of being incorrect given that the attacker is black: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (15%).

This means that, given the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is about 15%. However, because the witness's ability to correctly identify race is not perfect, this should be considered an estimate rather than an absolute certainty.
