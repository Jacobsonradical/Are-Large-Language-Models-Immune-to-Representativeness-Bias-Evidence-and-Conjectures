Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this witness's performance applies to the specific attacker in question.

We do know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness's performance is independent of the race of the attacker, then the probability that the attacker is black would be equal to the proportion of times the witness would identify a person as black, given their error rate.

Since the witness gets it right 80% of the time, they would get it right if the person is black 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% of the time if they pick randomly. They would also get it right 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68% of the time if the person is white (which happens 85% of the time).

The total probability of the witness saying "black" is therefore 0.12 (correct when black) + 0.68 (false positive when white) = 0.80. However, since the actual probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, the witness's statement should lead us to overestimate this probability.

Since the witness gets it wrong 20% of the time, they would get it wrong if the person is white 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% of the time if they pick randomly. They would also get it wrong 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3% of the time if the person is black (which happens 15% of the time).

The total probability of the witness saying "black" and being wrong is therefore 0.03 (false negative when black) + 0.17 (false positive when white) = 0.20.

The actual probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, and the probability that the witness says "black" and is correct is 0.12. The probability that the witness says "black" and is wrong is 0.20. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct given that they said "black" is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20) = 0.36 or 36%.

However, this does not give us a direct estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. To get this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness says "black") = P(witness says "black" | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness says "black")

We have already calculated the probabilities required for the numerator and denominator. Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness says "black") = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.28 = 0.42857 or 42.86%

This is an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement. It takes into account the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the population.
