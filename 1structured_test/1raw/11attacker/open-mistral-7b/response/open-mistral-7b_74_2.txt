To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to account for the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

We can model this situation as a Bayesian probability problem. Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(B|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black

We know that P(B) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city), P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people), and P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying non-black people).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Plugging in the values, we have:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.26

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 26%.
