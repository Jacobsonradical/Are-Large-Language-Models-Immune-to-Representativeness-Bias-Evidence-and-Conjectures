To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person, which is 0.8
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can be computed using the prior probabilities and the witness's error rate.

Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, we can estimate the prior probability of the attacker being black to be 15% (or 0.15).

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black can be computed as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black when they are actually white. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

So, P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.34

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 34%.
