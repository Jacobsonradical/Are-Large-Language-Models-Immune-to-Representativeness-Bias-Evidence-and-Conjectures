Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B is proportional to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of A (the attacker being black) is given as 15% in the first piece of information. The likelihood of B given A (the witness correctly identifying a black person) is given as 80%. The likelihood of B given not-A (the witness incorrectly identifying a white person) is given as 20%.

The posterior probability of A given B is therefore:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating, we find that:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.54

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 54%.
