To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistakenly identifying a black person as white or vice versa, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.

However, we should also consider the racial composition of the city's population. In this case, 15% of the city's population is black. If the witness's identification is correct, then the attacker must be one of the 15% of the population that is black.

Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification and the city's racial composition, is the product of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the proportion of the population that is black.

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, therefore the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 12%}
