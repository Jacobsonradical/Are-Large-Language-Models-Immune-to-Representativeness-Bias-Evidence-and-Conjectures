To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker being black (H1), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony (E). Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Where:
- H1 is the event that the attacker is black.
- H0 is the complementary event, i.e., the attacker is not black (white in this case).
- P(H1|E) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H1) is the probability of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.
- P(H1) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is what we need to estimate.
- P(E|H0) is the probability of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is not black (white). This is given as 0.2 in the problem.
- P(H0) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black. This is 1 - P(H1) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can plug in the values and calculate:

P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(H1|E) = 0.12 / 0.22
P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.545

So, given the witness's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.545 or 54.5%.
