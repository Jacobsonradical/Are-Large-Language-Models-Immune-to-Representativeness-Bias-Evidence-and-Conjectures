To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, and the city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white).

Given the witness's testimony, we know that P(witness says black) = P(attacker is black) * Reliability + P(attacker is white) * (1 - Reliability)

We also know that the population demographics give us P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) = 1

The witness said the attacker is black, so P(witness says black) = 1

Substituting this information into the first equation, we get:

1 = P(attacker is black) * 0.8 + P(attacker is white) * 0.2

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is black) = (1 - 0.2 * P(attacker is white)) / 0.8

Now we need to find P(attacker is white), which is given by the population demographics:

P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 1 - (1 - 0.2 * P(attacker is white)) / 0.8

Solving for P(attacker is white) gives us:

P(attacker is white) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.8P(attacker is white)) / 0.8

Solving this equation, we get:

P(attacker is white) = 0.1

Substituting this back into the equation for P(attacker is black), we get:

P(attacker is black) = (1 - 0.2 * 0.1) / 0.8 = 0.85

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.85, or 85%.
