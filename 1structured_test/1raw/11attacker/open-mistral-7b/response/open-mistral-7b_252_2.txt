To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the given information, we can calculate the values of these probabilities as follows:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability of an attacker being black in the population. Given that 15% of the population is black, we have P(H) = 0.15.

2. P(E|H): The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time when the person was actually black. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(E|~H): Since the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was actually white, we have P(E|~H) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353.

4. P(~H): Since P(H) + P(~H) = 1, we can calculate P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Calculating the numbers, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2353 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.1538

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 15.38%.
