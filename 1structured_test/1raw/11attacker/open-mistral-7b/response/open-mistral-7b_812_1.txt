Given the two pieces of information, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the population distribution in the city.

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, it's important to note that this identification may be incorrect due to the witness's error rate.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness's identification is correct:

Probability of witness's identification being correct = Probability of attacker being black * Witness's correct identification rate
                                                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                       = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect (the attacker is white):

Probability of witness's identification being incorrect = Probability of attacker being white * Witness's error rate
                                                                            = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                            = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification:

Probability of attacker being black, given witness's identification = Probability of witness's identification being correct / (Probability of witness's identification being correct + Probability of witness's identification being incorrect)
                                                                                               = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                                                                               â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is approximately 0.41 or 41%. However, it's important to remember that this is an estimate based on assumptions and may not perfectly reflect reality.
