Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black).

Given the witness's statement, if the attacker is black, there's a 80% chance the witness will correctly identify the attacker's race. So, P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8.

On the other hand, if the attacker is white, there's a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker's race. So, P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) = 0.2.

Given the city's demographic information, the probability that the attacker is white is P(White) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Black) = P(Witness says Black) * P(Black | Witness says Black) / [P(Witness says Black) * P(Black | Witness says Black) + P(Witness says Black) * P(White | Witness says Black) + P(Witness says Not Black) * P(Black | Witness says Not Black) + P(Witness says Not Black) * P(White | Witness says Not Black)]

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness says Not Black) or P(Black | Witness says Not Black). Since the witness's statement is "A witness identified the attacker as black," we can assume P(Witness says Black) is greater than 0.5. But this information alone is not sufficient to make a strict probability calculation.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
