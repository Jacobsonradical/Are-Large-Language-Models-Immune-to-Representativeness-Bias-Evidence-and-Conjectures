Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is supposedly 80% accurate in identifying races, identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake in identifying the attacker's race. We know that the witness errs 20% of the time. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually white but was misidentified as black.

On the other hand, if the attacker is indeed black, then the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a white person as black.

The probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%). The probability of erring and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%) times the probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.15 (15%).

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83, or 83% (rounded to two decimal places).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
