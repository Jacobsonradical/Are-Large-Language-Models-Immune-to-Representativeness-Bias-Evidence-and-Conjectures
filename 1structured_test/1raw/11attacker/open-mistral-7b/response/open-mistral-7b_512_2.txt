Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
2. The city's population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have information about how the witness's identification corresponds to the actual race of the attacker. To make an estimate, we can assume that the witness's identification errors are equally likely to be either calling a white person black or calling a black person white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The witness's statement suggests that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, so P(witness_corrects_black) = 0.8.

Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, and we assume these errors are equally likely, P(witness_calls_white_black) = 0.2.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness seeing a white person in the first place as P(white) = 0.85.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, the probability of the attacker being black under this scenario is P(attacker_is_black|witness_calls_white_black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Since the witness makes such errors 20% of the time, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement as:

P(attacker_is_black) = P(witness_corrects_black) * P(attacker_is_black|witness_corrects_black) + P(witness_calls_white_black) * P(attacker_is_black|witness_calls_white_black)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(attacker_is_black) = (0.8) * (1) + (0.2) * (0.15) = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83, or 83%.
