To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the information)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the information)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white (1 - P(A))
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black (which can be calculated using the probabilities above)

We are given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85.

We are also given that the witness's accuracy is 80% for black people and 20% for white people, so P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, based on the evidence provided by the witness, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 52%.
