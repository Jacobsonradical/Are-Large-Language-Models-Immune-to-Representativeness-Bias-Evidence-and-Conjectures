To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness was correct in this case is 0.8 (80%).

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified the attacker as black. Given that 85% of the city's population is white, it's more likely that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black than the other way around.

So, the probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (3%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
