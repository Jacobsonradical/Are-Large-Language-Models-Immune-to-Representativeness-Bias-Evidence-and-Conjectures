Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the following:
- H: The attacker is black
- θ: The true probability of H (which we don't know, but we can estimate based on city demographics)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- p(E|H): The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that H is true
- p(E|¬H): The probability of the witness making an incorrect identification given that H is false
- p(H): The prior probability of H (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- p(¬H): The prior probability of ¬H (the probability of the attacker not being black before considering the evidence)

According to the information given, we have:
- p(H) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- p(¬H) = 0.85
- p(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- p(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)

We want to find p(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

p(H|E) = p(E|H) * p(H) / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|¬H) * p(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

p(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

p(H|E) = 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and the city demographics, the updated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12, or 12%. This suggests that while the witness's identification is not totally unreliable, it does not significantly change the initial probability of the attacker being black based on city demographics.
