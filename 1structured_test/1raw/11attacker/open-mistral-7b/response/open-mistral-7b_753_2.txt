Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- H0: The attacker is white
- H1: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(H1), is given in the first piece of information: P(H1) = 0.15

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is black, P(E|H1), is given in the second piece of information: P(E|H1) = 0.8

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is white, P(E|H0), is given by the complement of P(E|H1): P(E|H0) = 1 - P(E|H1) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

The prior probability of the attacker being white, P(H0), is 1 - P(H1) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the probability:

P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18.75%.
