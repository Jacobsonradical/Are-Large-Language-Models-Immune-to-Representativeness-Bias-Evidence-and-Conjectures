Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have direct evidence that the witness's identification of the attacker was correct in this case.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's error rate. If we assume that the attacker was indeed white, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black would be the error rate of 20%.

However, since we don't have direct evidence of the attacker's race, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was white. Therefore, we cannot use the error rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is white.

Instead, we can use the population statistics to make an estimate. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, and the witness identified the attacker as black, it seems more likely that the attacker is indeed black.

However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on population statistics, and it does not take into account any other potential factors or evidence that could influence the attacker's race.

Given these considerations, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be the proportion of the population that is black, which is 15%. However, this is a conservative estimate, and in reality, the probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors.
