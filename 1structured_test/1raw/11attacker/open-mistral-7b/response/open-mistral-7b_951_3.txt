According to the information provided, 15% of the population is black, and the witness, who has an accuracy of 80% in identifying race, incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the product of the population proportion of blacks and the witness's accuracy in correctly identifying blacks.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is the product of the population proportion of whites and the witness's error rate in identifying whites.

We can set up an equation to represent these probabilities:

Probability(Attacker is Black) = Proportion of Blacks * Witness Accuracy in Identifying Blacks
                                                 = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                 = 0.12

Probability(Witness Errors in Identifying White as Black) = Proportion of Whites * Witness Error Rate
                                                                          = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                          = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually white is the complement of the probability of the witness erring in identifying a white as black:

Probability(Attacker is White) = 1 - Probability(Witness Errors in Identifying White as Black)
                                                 = 1 - 0.17
                                                 = 0.83

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

Probability(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = Probability(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * Probability(Attacker is Black) / Probability(Witness Identification)

However, we do not have the necessary information to calculate the probability of the witness identification given the attacker's race (Probability(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black)). Therefore, we cannot provide a strict answer in the dictionary format.

However, we can make an estimate based on the given information. Since the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks is higher (80%) than the proportion of blacks in the population (15%), it suggests that the witness is more likely to correctly identify black people. This, along with the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black, suggests that the attacker might be more likely to be black than white.

{probability: around 0.12, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and the reasoning provided}
