Based on the information provided, we can't directly use the witness's ability to identify race in this case because the victim couldn't see the attacker's race. However, we can use the population statistics to make an estimate.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%).

In the absence of more specific information, this would be our best guess. However, if we were to consider the witness's error rate, we would need to know whether the witness consistently overestimated or underestimated the number of black people, which is not provided in the information.
