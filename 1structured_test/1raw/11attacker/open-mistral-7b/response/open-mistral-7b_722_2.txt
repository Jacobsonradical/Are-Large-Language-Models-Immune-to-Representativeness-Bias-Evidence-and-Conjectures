To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is consistent for people of both races or if it varies. Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the witness's error rate is the same for both races.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's identification is based on probability, then the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is equal to the actual probability of the attacker being black.

The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is equal to the actual probability of the attacker being white times the witness's error rate. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this would be 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black, divided by the sum of the probabilities that the witness correctly identified a black person as black and incorrectly identified a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17) = 0.8 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.82, or 82%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.82}. This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both races and that the witness's identification is based on probability. If these assumptions are not valid, the estimate may not be accurate.
