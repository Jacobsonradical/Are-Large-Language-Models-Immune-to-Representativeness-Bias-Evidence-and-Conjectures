To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's race, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white. Given the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city, we have:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black)

P(white) = 0.15 (given in the information)

Now we can solve the equation for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 - 0.2 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.75} or 75%. This means that based on the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, there is a 75% chance that the attacker is black and a 25% chance that the attacker is white.
