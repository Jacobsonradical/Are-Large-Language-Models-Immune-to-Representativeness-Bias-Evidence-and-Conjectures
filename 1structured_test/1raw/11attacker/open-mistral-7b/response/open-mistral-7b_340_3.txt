Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is black"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The prior probability of A, which is the proportion of black people in the city: P(A) = 0.15
2. The conditional probability of B given A, which is the reliability of the witness when they see a black person: P(B|A) = 0.8
3. The conditional probability of B given not-A, which is the reliability of the witness when they see a white person: P(B|not-A) = 0.2

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

First, let's calculate the probability of not-A, which is the probability that the attacker is white: P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Then we can calculate the probability of B given not-A: P(B|not-A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate the probability of A given B using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.14

So, given the witness's description and their reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14%.
