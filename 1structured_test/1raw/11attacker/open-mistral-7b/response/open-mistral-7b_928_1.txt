Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the race 80% of the time and incorrectly identified it 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% from the city's population)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black (given that the attacker is actually black or not)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black, given that the attacker is indeed black

However, we don't have P(B) directly. But we do have the probability of the witness making a correct identification P(B|A) and the probability of the witness making a mistake P(B|not A). Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, the correct identification rate is 80%.

So, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

Since the total probability of the witness making a correct or incorrect identification is 1, we can calculate P(B|not A) as follows:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
