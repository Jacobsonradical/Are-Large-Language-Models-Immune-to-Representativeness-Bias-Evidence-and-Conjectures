To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we are interested in is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (unknown at this point)
- P(B) as the prior probability of a random person in the city being black (provided in the information as 15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (provided in the information as 0.8)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (1 - P(B|A))

We also know that the witness identified the attacker as black. Let's denote this event as E:

- P(E|A) = P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(E|not A) = P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

We can't compute P(A) directly, but it's proportional to the population composition:

P(A) = P(not A) = 0.15 (given in the information)

So, P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
