Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker is black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

1. P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80%).
2. P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%).
3. P(E): The probability of the witness's identification, regardless of the attacker's race, is calculated as the weighted sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H means not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) is 0.2. So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.182.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.182
          = 0.120

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this estimate should be used with caution and further investigation may be necessary.
