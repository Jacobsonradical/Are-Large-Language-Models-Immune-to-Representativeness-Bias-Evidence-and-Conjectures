To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black if they are actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness makes the statement)

We are given the following information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(A) = Unknown (we need to estimate this)
- P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A)) (since the witness makes the statement 85% of the time if the attacker is white and 15% of the time if the attacker is black)

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A))]

To find a specific value for P(A), we would need additional information or make an assumption. However, we can find the range of possible values. Since P(A) must be between 0 (the attacker is definitely white) and 1 (the attacker is definitely black), we can graph the function and see where it intersects the x-axis.

The graph of this function is a hyperbola that intersects the x-axis at approximately 0.21 and 0.9. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is between 0.21 and 1.

However, since the witness's statement is not very reliable (they only correctly identify race 80% of the time), it is not reasonable to assign a high probability to either outcome. Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be around the midpoint of this range, which is approximately 0.51.

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.51, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the unreliability of the witness's statement.
