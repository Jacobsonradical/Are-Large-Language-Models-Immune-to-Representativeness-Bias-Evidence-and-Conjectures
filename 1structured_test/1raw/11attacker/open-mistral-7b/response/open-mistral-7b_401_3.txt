Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (here, the witness's accuracy in identifying a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

First, we need to calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Next, we need P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 15% in the information provided.

Now, we need to calculate P(E), the probability of the witness making this identification, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H is the opposite of H (the attacker being white).

Since the attacker is white 85% of the time, and the witness is correct in identifying a white person as white 80% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.8.

Therefore, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.28.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. This is given by the formula above:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.3929

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.393 or 39.3%.
