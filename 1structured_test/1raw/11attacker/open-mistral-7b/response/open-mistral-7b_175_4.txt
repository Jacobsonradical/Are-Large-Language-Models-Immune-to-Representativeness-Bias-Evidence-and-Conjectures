Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
2. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
3. P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.15 = 0.8

So, given the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.
