Given the information provided, the probability estimate of the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black. But their ability to correctly identify race is only 80% under similar conditions.
3. This means that even if the attacker was actually white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.
4. Therefore, when we consider the possibility that the attacker was white, the probability of the witness making a mistaken identification is 0.2 (20%).
5. Since the attacker is either white or black, the probability of the witness making a correct identification (when the attacker is black) is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (80%).
6. The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%) and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).
7. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (when the attacker is black) is 0.8.
8. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black (when the attacker is white) is 0.2.
9. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by considering these two scenarios:
   a. The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black: P(attacker is black | witness ID is black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly IDs black | attacker is black) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
   b. The attacker is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black: P(attacker is black | witness ID is black) = P(attacker is white) * P(witness incorrectly IDs black | attacker is white) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
10. The total probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is the sum of these two scenarios: P(attacker is black | witness ID is black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

The probability estimate that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.29 or 29%.
