To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black in the city. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood of this event happening is equal to P(black) times the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8 (from information b).

On the other hand, if the attacker was white, the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying him as black is 0.2 (from information b).

Since the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black is equal to the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person, we can write an equation:

P(witness_identified_as_black) = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2

We know that P(witness_identified_as_black) is equal to the 80% identified by the witness (from information b), so we can write:

0.8 = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.
