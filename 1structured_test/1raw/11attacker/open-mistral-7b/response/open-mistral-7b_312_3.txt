Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's define our events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the prior probability of A (the proportion of black people in the city), which is 0.15 (from information b). We are also given the conditional probability of B given A (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people), which is 0.8 (from information a). However, we don't have the conditional probability of B given not-A (the witness's accuracy in misidentifying non-black people).

Let's assume that the witness's mistake rate is uniform across all races (which might not be the case in reality, but it's a simplifying assumption that allows us to make progress). Then, the conditional probability of B given not-A is also 0.8.

Now we can calculate the probability of event A given event B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)

Since P(B|not-A) = 0.8 and P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from information b), we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.464

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.464 or 46.4%.
