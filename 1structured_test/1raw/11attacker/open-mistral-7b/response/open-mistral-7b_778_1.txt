To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (provided in the second piece of information: 80%)
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (provided in the second piece of information: 20%)
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (given in the first piece of information: 85% or 0.85)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.21

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 21%.
