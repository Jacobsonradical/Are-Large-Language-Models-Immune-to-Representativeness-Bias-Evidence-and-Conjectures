Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the racial distribution of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The city's racial distribution: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, since we don't know whether the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of under- or over-estimating the black population, we cannot directly apply this percentage to adjust the city's racial distribution.

Given this, the best estimate we can make is based on the city's racial distribution. The probability that the attacker is black, according to the city's racial demographic, is 15% (or 0.15).

Therefore, {probability: 0.15} is the best estimate based on the information provided. It is important to note that this is an estimate, and the actual probability might differ due to factors not accounted for in the given information.
