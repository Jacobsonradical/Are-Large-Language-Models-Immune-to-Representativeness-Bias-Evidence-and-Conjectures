Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
2. The population composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we need to consider the bias that the witness's identification might introduce. Since the witness misidentified race 20% of the time, they might have erroneously identified a white person as black in this case.

Given the witness's statement, we cannot dismiss the possibility that the attacker is white. Therefore, we should consider both the actual population ratio and the potential error of the witness.

Let's denote the actual probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Given the population ratio, we have P(black) = 0.15.

Given the witness's error rate, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. This is the conditional probability P(witness correct | black) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness made an error, misidentifying a white person as black. This is the conditional probability P(witness incorrect | not black) = 0.2.

Given the witness's statement, we can assume that the probability that the attacker is white is equal to the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black. This is because the witness did not report seeing a white person. Therefore, P(white) = P(witness incorrect | not black) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the expected probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement:

P(black | witness statement) = P(black) * P(witness correct | black) + P(not black) * P(witness incorrect | not black)
                                             = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0
                                             = 0.12 + 0
                                             = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the actual population ratio of 15%, suggesting that the witness's statement might be biased or uncertain.
