Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data: the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the population in the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. This means that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, and in 20% of cases, they make an error.

However, since we do not have any information about the attacker's race being correct or incorrect in this specific case, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to our estimate. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's race given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of event B given A times the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, and let P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8. Let P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, and we are given that P(B|~A) = 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), is given by the racial composition of the city: P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, P(B|A), using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, and we calculated that P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We are given that P(B|~A) = 0.2 and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.241

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.241 or 24.1%. This means that based on the given information, it is slightly more likely that the attacker is white than black. However, this is a probabilistic estimate, and there is still a significant chance that the attacker is black.
