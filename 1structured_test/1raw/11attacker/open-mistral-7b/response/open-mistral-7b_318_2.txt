To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (erring in identifying race). Since we don't have enough information to determine whether this witness errs more often in identifying black people as white or white people as black, we'll assume an equal error rate (50% error for each race).

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black:

P(Attacker is Black) = Witness's Correct Rate for Black People * Proportion of Black People in the City
                                     = 0.8 * 0.15
                                     = 0.12

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
