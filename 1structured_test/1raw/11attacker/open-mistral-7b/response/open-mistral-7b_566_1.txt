Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race under dark conditions, identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the attacker being black under perfect conditions (if the witness could see clearly) would be 15%. However, the witness is not perfect, and they mistakenly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time when the attacker is actually white.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

A) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. The probability of this is the true probability of the attacker being black (15%) multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals (0.8).

B) The attacker is actually white, and the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race. The probability of this is the true probability of the attacker being white (1 - 15% = 85%) multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying white individuals (0.2).

The total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of probabilities A and B.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and may not be completely accurate due to the simplifications made in the analysis.
