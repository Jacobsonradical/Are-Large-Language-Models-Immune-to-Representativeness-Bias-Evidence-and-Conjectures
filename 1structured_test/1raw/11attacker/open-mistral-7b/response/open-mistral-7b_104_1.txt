Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, because we do not know if the witness made an error in this specific case.

To make an estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is black) based on evidence. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black), and P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18 (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, regardless of their actual race).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.18 = 0.0714 or 7.14%

So, given the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city, the probability that the attacker is actually black is estimated to be around 7.14%. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions, including the reliability of the witness and the assumption that the population of the city is representative of the attacker's population. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
