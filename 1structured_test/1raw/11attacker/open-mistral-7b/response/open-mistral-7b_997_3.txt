Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 15% (as mentioned in the first piece of information)
2. P(B|A) = 100% (since the witness in this specific case correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker was indeed black)
3. P(B|~A) = 20% (as mentioned in the second piece of information) (where ~A represents the event that the attacker is not black)
4. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (100% * 15%) + (20% * 85%) = 15% + 17% = 32%

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [100% * 0.15] / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 46.875%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.46875}
