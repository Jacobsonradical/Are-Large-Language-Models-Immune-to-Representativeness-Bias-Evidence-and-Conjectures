The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is not very reliable in identifying races (correctly identifying 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time) has reported that the attacker is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider not only the racial makeup of the city but also the reliability of the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, we can calculate P(W|B) as 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80%.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person (white) as black 20% of the time, we can calculate P(W|~B) as 0.20.

The witness has identified the attacker as black, so the event we are interested in is W. The probability of event W occurring can be calculated as the probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying him (which happens with probability P(W|B)), plus the probability of the attacker being mistakenly identified as black (which happens with probability P(W|~B)):

P(W) = P(B) * P(W|B) + P(~B) * P(W|~B)

However, we only know the probabilities of P(B) and P(W|B). We don't have enough information to calculate P(~B) directly from the given information. To proceed, we can make an assumption about the balance between the two races, i.e., P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black (P(W|B)) and given that the attacker is not black (P(W|~B)). Using these probabilities, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20

P(W) â‰ˆ 0.21

The witness's report of seeing a black attacker has a probability of 0.21, given the racial makeup of the city and the witness's reliability. However, it is important to note that the assumption of P(~B) = 0.15 is a simplification and might not accurately represent the actual distribution of races in the city. If we had more information about the racial distribution in the city, it would be possible to make a more precise estimate.

In the dictionary format, the probability estimate of the attacker being black is:

{probability: 0.21}
