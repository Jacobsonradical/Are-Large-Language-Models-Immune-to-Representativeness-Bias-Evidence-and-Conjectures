The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, that means they made a correct identification 80% of the time or an error 20% of the time. However, since we don't know whether the witness's identification was correct or not, we need to consider both possibilities.

If the witness's identification was correct, then the attacker is indeed black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the probability of a correct identification).

If the witness's identification was incorrect, then the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability that the witness made an error and identified the attacker as black is 0.2 (the probability of an error).

Since we don't know which of these two scenarios is the actual case, we need to combine their probabilities to get an overall estimate. This is done using Bayes' theorem, which in this case gives us:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of correct identification * Probability of attacker being black given correct identification + Probability of error * Probability of attacker being black given error

From the information given, the probabilities are:

Probability of correct identification = 0.8
Probability of attacker being black given correct identification = 1 (since if the witness is correct, the attacker must be black)
Probability of error = 0.2
Probability of attacker being black given error = 0 (since if the witness is wrong, the attacker must be white)

So,

Probability of attacker being black = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8, or 80%.
