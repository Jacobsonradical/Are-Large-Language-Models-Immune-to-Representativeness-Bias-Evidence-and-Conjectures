Given the information provided, we can estimate the likelihood of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% in favorable conditions.
3. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black, considering the witness's error:

The probability that the attacker is black in the general population is 15%.

Given that the witness made an error, we should consider the possibility that the witness was incorrect when they identified the attacker as black. In this case, the actual attacker might be white.

The probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is white is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% (1 - 80%).

Since the attacker is either black with a probability of 15% or white with a probability of 20%, the total probability of either outcome is:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness is correct) * P(attacker is black given witness is correct) + P(witness is incorrect) * P(attacker is white given witness is incorrect)

P(attacker is black) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
