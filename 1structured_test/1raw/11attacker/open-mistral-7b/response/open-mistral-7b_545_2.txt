Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

We have the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) = 0.15 (from the city's demographic data)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  Where ~H means not black, and P(~H) = 0.85 (from the city's demographic data)

We don't have direct information about P(E|~H), but we can find it using the witness's accuracy in identifying white people (which is 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2).

So, P(E|~H) = 0.2, and P(E) = 0.12 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.182.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.182 â‰ˆ 0.44

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.44, or 44%.
