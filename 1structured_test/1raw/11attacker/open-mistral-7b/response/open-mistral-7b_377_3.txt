Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. We know that the attacker's race was not definitively identified by the victim, so we should consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (80%) and the probability of the witness erring and misidentifying the attacker as black (20%).

Since we don't have any additional information about the actual race distribution of the attacker, we cannot determine which of these two probabilities is more likely. Therefore, the best estimate we can make is to consider both probabilities equally likely, as the victim's inability to definitively identify the attacker's race suggests that the attacker could have been either black or white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the uncertainty, would be the sum of the two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 (from the witness's correct identification) + 0.2 (from the witness's error), probability = 1.0}

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we can conclude that the information provided is not sufficient to make a reliable estimate of the attacker's race. It is important to note that the actual probability could be significantly different from our estimated value of 1.0, and further investigation would be necessary to determine the true probability.

Therefore, I would recommend revisiting the information and considering any additional context or evidence that could help refine the estimate.
