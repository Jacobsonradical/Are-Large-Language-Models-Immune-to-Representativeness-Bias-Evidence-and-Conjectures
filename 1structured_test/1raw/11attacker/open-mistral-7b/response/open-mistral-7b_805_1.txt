To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

1. The witness's racial identification is not perfect. They correctly identify the race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. So when they say the attacker is black, there's a 0.8 probability that they're correct and a 0.2 probability that they're wrong.

2. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the actual probability of the attacker being black is P(black) * 0.8 + P(not black) * 0.2, where P(not black) is the probability of the attacker being white.

3. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(not black) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.

4. Therefore, the actual probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.068 * 0.2 = 0.184 or 18.4%.

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.184, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This estimate is lower than the actual population percentage of black individuals in the city due to the witness's imperfect ability to identify race.
