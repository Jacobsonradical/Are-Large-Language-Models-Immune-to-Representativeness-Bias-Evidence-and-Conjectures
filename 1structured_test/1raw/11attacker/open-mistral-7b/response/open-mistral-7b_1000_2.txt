Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of A (attacker being black) as P(A), and the probability of B (witness identifying attacker as black) as P(B|A). We also have the prior probability of the attacker being black in the population, P(A), which is given by the population statistics in the second piece of information: P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the first piece of information).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from the first piece of information). The "not A" is used because the witness's mistake rate is given for both races combined.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker of any race as black is P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.78 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.78 or 78%. This means there is a 78% chance that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification and the population statistics.
