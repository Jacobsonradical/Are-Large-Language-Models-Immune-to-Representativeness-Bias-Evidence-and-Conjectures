Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The attacker's race is unknown to the victim, so we can assume the witness's error rate applies here.

In the city, 15% of the population is black. However, the witness's statement suggests that they err in identifying race 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify a white person as black 10% of the time, given our assumption that half of the population is white.

So, when the witness says the attacker is black, we need to consider both the true black population proportion (15%) and the witness's error rate (10%).

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is P(black) + 10%.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the ratio of the true black population proportion to the sum of the true black population proportion and the witness's error rate, which is:

P(attacker is black | witness's statement) = (P(black)) / (P(black) + 0.1)

We don't have enough information to directly compute P(black), so the final answer will be a probability estimate based on the data given:

{probability: 0.57142857, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 57.14%.
