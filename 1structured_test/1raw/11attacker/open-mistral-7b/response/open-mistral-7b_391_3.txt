Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to make an estimate of the attacker's race, as the witness's identification might be an error.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in, P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A, P(A) is the prior probability of event A, and P(B) is the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in, P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (which is 1, as the witness always correctly identifies race when it is indeed black), P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which is given by the city's population composition), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (which is a weighted average of the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person, based on the city's population composition).

Calculating P(B) involves multiplying the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8) by the proportion of the population that is black (0.15), and multiplying the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person (0.2) by the proportion of the population that is white (0.85).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.367.

So, based on the witness's identification and the city's population composition, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.367 or 36.7%.
