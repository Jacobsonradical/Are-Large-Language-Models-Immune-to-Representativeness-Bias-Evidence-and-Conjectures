Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we know is 15% from the population statistics.
2. P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which we know is 80% from the witness's reliability.
3. P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (given that half of the time the witness is mistaken, they must be mistaken about white people).
4. P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.
5. P(E) is the probability of the witness making any identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H).

Using these values, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.267, or 26.7%.

Therefore, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 26.7%.
