Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, the attack occurred at night when the witness could not see the attacker's race, and the witness's ability to correctly identify race at night is only 80%.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

1. The probability that the witness would correctly identify a black attacker in good lighting conditions is 0.8 (80%).
2. However, we know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race at night is only 80% of their daytime accuracy, so the probability that they would correctly identify a black attacker in the dark is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (64%).
3. Since 15% of the city's population is black, the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the probability that the witness would correctly identify a black attacker in the dark. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.64.

In dictionary format: {probability: 0.64}
