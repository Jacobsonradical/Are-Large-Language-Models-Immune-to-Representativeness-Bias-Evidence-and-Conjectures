To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (probability of the witness identifying a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (probability of the witness giving the testimony)

First, let's calculate P(B|A). This is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 80% in the information provided. So, P(B|A) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate P(A). This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which can be estimated using the population statistics provided. Since 15% of the population is black, P(A) = 0.15

Now, we need to calculate P(B). This is the probability of the witness giving the testimony, which is not given in the information provided. However, since the witness's accuracy is balanced between identifying black and white people (80% correct for black people and 20% correct for white people), we can assume that the probability of the witness giving the testimony is independent of the attacker's race. In other words, P(B) should be the same for both black and white attackers.

Since 85% of the population is white, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can estimate P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white: P(B) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 = 0.18

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18%. This means that, given the information and the assumptions made, we believe there is a 18% chance that the attacker is black and an 82% chance that the attacker is white.
