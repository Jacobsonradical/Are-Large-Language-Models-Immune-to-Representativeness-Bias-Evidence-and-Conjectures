Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have enough information about how often the witness encounters white and black individuals to apply these percentages directly to this case.
4. Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, it's more accurate to use the error rate (20%) as a probability in this scenario.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.2 (20%). This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually black, and the 80% chance that the witness made an error in their identification.
