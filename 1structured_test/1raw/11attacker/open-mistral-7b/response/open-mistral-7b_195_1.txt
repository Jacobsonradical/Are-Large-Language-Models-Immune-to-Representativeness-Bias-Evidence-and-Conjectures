To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness identified race correctly 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying blacks as whites or vice versa. Let's assume for now that the error rate is equally distributed.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. This means the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

If the witness's error rate is equally distributed, we can expect the witness to make an error 20% of the time. This means, out of the 20% of the time the witness makes an error, the witness will incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time * 0.85 (probability of choosing a white person) = 0.17 of the time.

Similarly, the witness will incorrectly identify a black person as white 20% of the time * 0.15 (probability of choosing a black person) = 0.03 of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means the witness did not make an error in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.15.

However, we know that the witness actually made an error 20% of the time, and in those cases, they identified a black person as white. So, the probability that the witness's identification of a black person as black is correct (given that they identified a person as black) is actually 1 - 0.20 * 0.03 = 0.94 (or 94%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.15 * 0.94 = 0.141 or 14.1%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is equally distributed between misidentifying whites as blacks and misidentifying blacks as whites, which may not be the case. A more precise estimate would require more information about the witness's error rate and its distribution.
