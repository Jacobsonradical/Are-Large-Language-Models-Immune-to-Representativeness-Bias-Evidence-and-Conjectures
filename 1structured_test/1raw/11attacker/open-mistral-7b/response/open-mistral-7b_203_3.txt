Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is given as 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(B|not A)) is given as 0.2 (20%).

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is not given, but we can infer it from the population statistics provided. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(A) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness identifying anyone as black (P(B)) is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), which is 0.8 + 0.2 = 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8

P(A|B) = 0.15 / 1

P(A|B) = 0.15

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
