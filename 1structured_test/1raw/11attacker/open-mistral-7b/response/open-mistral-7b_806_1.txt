Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't have any information about the attacker being from this specific city's population.

If we were to assume that the attacker is from the city's population, we could make an estimation based on the population breakdown. However, since the witness's statement suggests that they saw the attacker and made a judgment about their race, it would be more appropriate to use the witness's ability to correctly identify race as a probability estimate.

The witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, and they saw someone they thought was black. Therefore, our best estimate would be {probability: 0.8, the attacker is black}. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on incomplete information and there could be other factors at play that we're not aware of.
