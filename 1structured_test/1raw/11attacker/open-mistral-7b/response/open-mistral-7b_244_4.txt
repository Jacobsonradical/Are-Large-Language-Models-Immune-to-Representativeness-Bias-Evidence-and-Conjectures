To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If the witness said the attacker was black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a correct identification by the witness.

Given that 85% of the population is white, there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person is black. The witness identified the attacker as black, so the probability that the attacker is black is the proportion of black people among the set of people the witness could have mistakenly identified as black.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the set of people the witness could have mistakenly identified as black is 20% of the total population. Among this set of 20%, 15% are actually black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 0.15 (the proportion of black people among the set of people the witness could have mistakenly identified as black).

The overall probability that the attacker is black is the product of the probability that the witness errs and the probability that the attacker is black given the error.

The probability that the witness errs is 0.2 (20%). So, the overall probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3%.
