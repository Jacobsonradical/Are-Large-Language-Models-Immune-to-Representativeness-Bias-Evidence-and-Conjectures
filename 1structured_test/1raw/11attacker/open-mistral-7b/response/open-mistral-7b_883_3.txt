To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to know if their error rate is the same for white and black individuals. If the error rate is equal for both races, the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city), and the probability of a false negative (identifying a black person as white) is also 15% (the proportion of white people in the city).

Given this, the witness's identification of the attacker as black could be a false positive or a correct identification. The probability of a false positive is 15%, and the probability of a correct identification is 15% times the probability that the attacker is actually black, which we don't know.

So, we can't provide a strict probability estimate without more information. However, we can say that given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is likely to be greater than 15% but less than 30% (15% + 15% * some probability between 0 and 1). This is because the witness's identification is more likely to be correct than a random guess, but we don't know the exact probability.
