To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

Let's break down the variables:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We're given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population of the city is 15% black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2 (the probability of any person being identified as black by the witness)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2 = 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.6 or 60%.
