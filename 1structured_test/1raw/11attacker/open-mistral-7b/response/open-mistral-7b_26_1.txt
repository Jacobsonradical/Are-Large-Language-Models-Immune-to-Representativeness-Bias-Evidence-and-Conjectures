The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this a correct identification in 80% of the cases where the attacker is indeed black.

However, we also know that in the city, 15% of the population is black. So, the probability that a randomly selected individual is black is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we need to account for the witness's error rate. The witness's incorrect identification would likely lead to overestimating the number of black attackers. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a race 20% of the time, this means that in 20% of the cases where the attacker is actually white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black.

To find the probability that the attacker is actually black, considering the witness's accuracy and error, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = (P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)) / (P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate for identifying white people as black is zero, which might not be the case in reality. Adjusting the calculation to account for this would require more information.
