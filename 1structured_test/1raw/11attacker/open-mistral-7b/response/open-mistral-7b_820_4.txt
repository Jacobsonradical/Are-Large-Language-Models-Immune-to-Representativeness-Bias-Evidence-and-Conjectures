Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The racial distribution of the city's population, where 85% is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, where they correctly identify 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make: the witness's error rate is given in the context of a 50/50 racial mix, but in the actual city, the racial distribution is not equal.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we could take two approaches:

1. Naive Bayes approach: This method assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the city's racial distribution. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be the witness's estimated probability of a person being black, which is 0.8 (80%). However, this approach ignores the fact that the city's population is not evenly split.

2. More nuanced approach: To account for the city's racial distribution, we could use Bayes' theorem. Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) and P(W|~B) be the probabilities that the witness correctly identifies a black person and a white person, respectively. We can estimate these probabilities based on the witness's error rate and the city's racial distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get: P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get: P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of about 0.24, or 24%.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant regardless of the racial distribution. Given the limitations of the information, this might not be a reliable estimate. Without more information, it's difficult to provide a definitive probability.
