Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the probability before considering new evidence) with the likelihood of the new evidence.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15% (0.15). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is the accuracy of the witness in such situations, which is 80% (0.8).

However, the witness also errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is the error rate of the witness, which is 20% (0.2).

So, the updated probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)}

To calculate this, you can multiply the prior probability by the likelihood of the witness being correct given that the attacker is black, and divide by the sum of this probability and the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is white.

This calculation gives an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.35, or 35%.
