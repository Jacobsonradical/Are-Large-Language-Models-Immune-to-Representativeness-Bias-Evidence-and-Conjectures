To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness statement)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) = 0.85 * P(attacker is white) + 0.15 * P(attacker is black) (probability of witness statement given any attacker)

We know that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(attacker is white) = 0.85 and P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.85 * P(attacker is white) + 0.15 * P(attacker is black)
     = 0.85 * 0.85 + 0.15 * 0.15
     = 0.7225

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.7225
        â‰ˆ 0.185

So our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 18.5%.
