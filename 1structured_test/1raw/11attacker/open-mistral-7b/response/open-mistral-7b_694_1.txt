To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

In this case, we have two events:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have two pieces of prior information:
a) The witness's ability to judge a person's race. In 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, and in 20% of cases, they err.
b) The population demographics of the city. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
P(A) is the prior probability of A
P(B) is the prior probability of B

First, let's find P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given by the population demographics: P(A) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness making an error, P(B|not A), is given by the error rate: P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, P(not A) is 0.85. Therefore, P(B|not A) = P(B|A) * P(not A) / P(A) = 0.2.

Finally, we can find P(B), the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, by considering both cases: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18.

Now we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.78 or 78%.

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 78%. Note that this estimate is based on the given information and the assumptions made in applying Bayes' theorem. In reality, the actual probability may be different.
