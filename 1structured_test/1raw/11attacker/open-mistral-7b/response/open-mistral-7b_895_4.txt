Given the information provided, we have a witness who is somewhat reliable at identifying race, with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%. However, we do not have information about how accurate the witness was in this specific case.

The second piece of information is the racial composition of the city, with 85% being white and 15% being black.

Since we do not have enough information about the witness's accuracy in this specific case, it is not possible to provide a concrete probability estimate. However, if we were to make an assumption, we could use the city's racial composition as a rough estimate. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be 15%, as 15% of the city's population is black. But this is a simplified and potentially inaccurate interpretation, as it does not take into account the witness's reliability.
