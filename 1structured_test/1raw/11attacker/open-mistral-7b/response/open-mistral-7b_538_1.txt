Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the person was white)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (15% of the population is white, so 85% is not black)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.1725
     = 0.2925

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2925
      = 0.12 / 0.2925
      â‰ˆ 0.408

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.408 or 40.8%.
