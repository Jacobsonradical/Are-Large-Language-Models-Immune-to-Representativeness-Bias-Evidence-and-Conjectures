To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, providing a way to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: H1: the attacker is black, and H2: the attacker is white. We also have two pieces of evidence: E1: the witness's identification of the attacker, and E2: the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote:
P(H1) as the prior probability of the attacker being black,
P(H2) as the prior probability of the attacker being white,
P(E1|H1) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker correctly given that the attacker is black,
P(E1|H2) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly given that the attacker is white,
P(E2|H1) as the probability of the racial demographics given that the attacker is black,
P(E2|H2) as the probability of the racial demographics given that the attacker is white.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, P(H1|E1 and E2), as follows:

P(H1|E1 and E2) = [P(E1|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E1|H1) * P(H1) + P(E1|H2) * P(H2)]

We are given the following information:

- P(H1) = 0.15 (from E2)
- P(H2) = 0.85 (from E2)
- P(E1|H1) = 0.8
- P(E1|H2) = 0.2

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H1|E1 and E2) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H1|E1 and E2) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, our estimate is that there is a 18% probability that the attacker is black. This estimate is lower than the witness's identification, which suggests that the witness may have made a mistake or been influenced by biases. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say why the probability is lower than the witness's identification.
