Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is random, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the demographics of the city, which is 15%. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is not black is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

Let's calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
