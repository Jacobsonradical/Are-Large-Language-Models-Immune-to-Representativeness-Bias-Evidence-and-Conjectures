The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in statistics to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H0: The attacker is white
- H1: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's description of the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being white (P(H0)) is 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white), and the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H1)) is 0.15.

The probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(E|H0)) is the error rate mentioned in the information, which is 0.20 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

The probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(E|H1)) is 1 minus the error rate, which is 0.80.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability of the attacker being black (P(H1|E)):

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.20 * 0.85) + (0.80 * 0.15)]

Calculating this value, we find that the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.308 (or 30.8%).
