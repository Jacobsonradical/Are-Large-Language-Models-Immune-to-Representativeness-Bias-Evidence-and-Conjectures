To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, this suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white. However, the witness's testimony that the attacker is black cannot be ignored.

The witness's accuracy is 80%, meaning they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. This means they are wrong 20% of the time. Given that half the people they see are white and half are black, this means they are incorrectly identifying a white person as black 20% of the time they see a white person.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:
1. The witness made a mistake and the attacker is actually white. The probability of this is 20%.
2. The witness was correct and the attacker is black. The probability of this is 1 - the probability of the first scenario, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.
