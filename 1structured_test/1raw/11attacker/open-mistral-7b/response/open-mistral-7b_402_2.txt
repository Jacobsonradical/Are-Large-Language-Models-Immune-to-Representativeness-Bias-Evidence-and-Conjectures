The given information consists of two parts: the racial composition of the city's population and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the witness's statement that the attacker is black. We don't know if the witness is correct or not. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief in the attacker's race based on the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, we have:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = [P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness statement)]

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(Attacker is black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(Witness statement) = P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness statement | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)

We don't have the probability of P(Witness statement | Attacker is white), but we can estimate it by assuming that the witness has the same accuracy in identifying race for both white and black people. In that case, P(Witness statement | Attacker is white) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(Witness statement):

P(Witness statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(Attacker is black | Witness statement):

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8 = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual probability may be different based on factors not considered in this analysis.
