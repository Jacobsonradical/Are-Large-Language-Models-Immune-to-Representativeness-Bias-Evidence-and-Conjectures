The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given two probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15: The prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's demographic data
2. P(W|A) = 0.8: The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
3. P(W|~A) = 0.2: The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|W) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the result, we find:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.378

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 37.8%.
