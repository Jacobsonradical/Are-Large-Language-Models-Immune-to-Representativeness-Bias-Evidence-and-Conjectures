Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to identify race is 80% accurate for blacks and 20% accurate for whites, identified the attacker as black.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot assume that the witness's identification is necessarily correct. If we assume that the witness's identification is always correct, then the probability that the attacker is black would be 100%. But given the witness's error rate, it's more likely that the witness made a mistake.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake:

1. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 20%.
2. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a mistake (identifying a white person as black) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, we don't know the probability of the witness identifying a black person as white. Given the information provided, we can't calculate this probability. Therefore, we can only make a probability estimate based on the probability of the witness making a mistake with white people.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and there's a 17% chance that the witness made a mistake, the probability that the attacker is white is 17%.

So, in the absence of more information, a conservative estimate would be that the attacker is white 17% of the time and black 83% of the time.
