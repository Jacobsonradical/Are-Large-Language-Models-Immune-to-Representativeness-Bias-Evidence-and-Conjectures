Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This is the prior probability of an attacker being black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This is the likelihood ratio for a black attacker being misidentified as white.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability with the new information:
   P(black attacker | witness identification) = P(witness identification | black attacker) * P(black attacker) / [P(witness identification | black attacker) * P(black attacker) + P(witness identification | not black attacker) * P(not black attacker)]

4. The likelihood ratio of a white attacker being misidentified as black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
5. Since we don't have the prior probability of a white attacker, we can't directly calculate the probability of a white attacker being misidentified as black by the witness. However, we can assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, meaning that the error rate for misidentifying a white attacker as black should be the same as the error rate for misidentifying a black attacker as white.
6. Using this assumption, we can rewrite the Bayes' theorem equation as:
   P(black attacker | witness identification) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
