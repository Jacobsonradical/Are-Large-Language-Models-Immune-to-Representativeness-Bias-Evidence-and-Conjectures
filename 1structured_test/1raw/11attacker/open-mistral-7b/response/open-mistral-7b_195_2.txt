Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have information about the attacker's presence in the sample used to assess the witness's ability.

Assuming the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement and the city's demographics.

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black is the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are white is their error rate of 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification and an error given that the attacker is black or white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.8) / ((0.8) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.315 or 31.5%.

However, as mentioned earlier, this estimation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be taken as an approximation and not as definitive evidence.

{probability: 0.315, please note that this is an approximation due to the assumptions made}
