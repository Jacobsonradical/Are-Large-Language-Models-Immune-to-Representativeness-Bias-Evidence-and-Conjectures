Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data. First, the city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. Second, a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the event "A" as the attacker being black and event "W" as the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black. We can calculate the probability of event A (the attacker being black) as follows:

P(A) = P(A and W) + P(A and not W) * (1 - P(W | A))

Since the witness misidentified the attacker's race in 20% of the cases when the attacker was actually black, P(W | A) = 0.2.

However, we don't have any information about the probability of event "A and not W" (the attacker being black, but the witness misidentifies the race). Without this information, we cannot calculate P(A) directly.

However, we can provide an upper bound for P(A) by assuming the worst-case scenario for the attacker being black:

P(A) ≤ P(A and W) + P(A and not W)

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A and W) as follows:

P(A and W) = P(W | A) * P(A)

Since we don't have a value for P(A), we can only give an answer in terms of P(A):

P(A) ≤ P(W | A) * P(A) ≤ 0.8 * P(A)

So, based on the given information, we cannot provide a specific number for P(A), but it is bounded above by 0.8 * P(A). This means that the probability of the attacker being black is less than or equal to 80% of an unknown value. This is not a definitive answer, but it is the best estimate we can make given the provided information.

{probability: less than or equal to 0.8 * P(A), please note that P(A) is an unknown value}
