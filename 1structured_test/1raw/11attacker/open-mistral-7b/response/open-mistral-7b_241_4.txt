Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's a crucial piece of information missing. We don't know if the witness's errors in race identification are more likely to occur when they incorrectly identify a black person as white or vice versa. Without this information, we can't directly apply the witness's error rate to the population demographics to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, based on the given information, I'm unable to provide a reliable probability estimate. It would require more specific data about the witness's error pattern to make an informed calculation.
