Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The probability of event A (the attacker being black) is given as 15% in the second piece of information. The probability of event B (the witness identifying the attacker as black) given event A (the attacker being black) is given as 0.8 (80% correct) in the first piece of information.

The probability of event B given the complement of event A (the attacker being white) is given as 0.2 (20% correct) in the first piece of information. The probability of the complement of event A (the attacker being white) is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% white population).

So, the probability of event B (the witness identifying the attacker as black) is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21 + 0.17 = 0.38.

Therefore, the probability of event A (the attacker being black) given event B (the witness identifying the attacker as black) is the probability of event B given event A divided by the probability of event B, which is 0.8 / 0.38 = 2.1.

However, this is not a probability between 0 and 1, so we need to find the probability of event A that gives the same odds as the witness's identification. Since the odds of event A given event B is 2.1, the probability of event A is 2.1 / (1 + 2.1) = 0.68, or approximately 68%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68}.
