Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, has an error rate of 20% when identifying race. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.
3. The witness correctly identified the attacker as black. But we cannot be sure if this was a correct identification or an error.
4. To account for this uncertainty, we can consider the probability that the witness's identification was correct and the probability that it was an error.
5. The probability that the witness's identification was an error is equal to the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.
6. This means that the probability that the witness's identification was correct is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.
7. However, since we know that 85% of the population is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies whites as black 20% of the time, there is a chance that the attacker was mistakenly identified as black due to this error.
8. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we need to account for this possibility.
9. Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In that case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time.
10. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as black was an error, and the attacker is actually white.
11. If the attacker is white, then the actual population proportion of black attackers is 0 (since there are no black attackers in this scenario).
12. However, due to the witness's error, we might mistakenly believe that the attacker is black.
13. To account for this, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.
14. Since the witness incorrectly identifies whites as black 20% of the time, and there are 15% blacks in the population, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, is 15% * 20% / 20% = 15%.
15. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, taking into account the witness's error, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, multiplied by the actual probability of a black attacker, plus the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually white.
16. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
