To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

1. From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. From the second piece of information, we know that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
3. However, we don't have information about the witness's performance in specific conditions like nighttime or when attacking from behind.

Without this additional information, it's challenging to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's statement. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider both the city's racial demographics and the witness's accuracy rate, but without the specific conditions relevant to this incident, we cannot provide a precise estimate.
