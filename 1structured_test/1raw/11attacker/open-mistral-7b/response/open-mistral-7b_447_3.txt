Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% for correctly identifying and 20% for incorrectly identifying. However, the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black.

The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's incorrect identification. Since the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black than a black person as white, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's error.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to calculate the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a black person as white (P(B|A)):

P(B|A) = 1 - P(correctly identifies A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person as black (P(B|¬A)):

Since the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black than a black person as white, we can assume P(B|¬A) > P(B|A). Let's assume P(B|¬A) = 0.4.

Now, we can calculate P(A) and P(¬A):

P(A) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being black)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being white)

Finally, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.2) \* 0.15 + (0.4) \* 0.85 = 0.31

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.2) \* 0.15 / 0.31 ≈ 0.161

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is approximately 16.1%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on assumptions about the witness's error rates, which may not be accurate. Therefore, it's essential to consider this estimate as a rough estimate and not a definitive answer.
