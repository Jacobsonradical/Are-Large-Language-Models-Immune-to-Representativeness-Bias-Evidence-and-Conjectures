Given the information provided, the population composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness account that the attacker was identified as black with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is truly black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white with a probability of 1 - p (where p is the probability that the attacker is black). Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

So, p = (0.8) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)) = 0.282 or 28.2%

However, since the original information stated that 15% of the population is black, and the witness's reported accuracy is higher than that, it seems there might be an inconsistency or error in the witness's reported accuracy. Therefore, the estimate of 28.2% should be interpreted with caution.

{probability: 0.282, please note that this estimate may not accurately reflect the true probability due to the potential inconsistency in the witness's reported accuracy}
