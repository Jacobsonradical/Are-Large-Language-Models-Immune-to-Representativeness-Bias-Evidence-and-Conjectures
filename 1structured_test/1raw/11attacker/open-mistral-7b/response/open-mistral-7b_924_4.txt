To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races (white and black), then the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) is 20% / 2 = 10%.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of choosing a white person at random is 0.85. If the witness identifies a person as black, the probability that the person is actually black is the probability of a correct identification times the probability of choosing a black person at random, or 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, if the witness makes a false positive, the probability that the person is actually black is the probability of a false positive times the probability of choosing a black person at random, or 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.015.

The total probability of the witness identifying a person as black is the sum of the probabilities of a correct identification and the probabilities of a false positive, or 0.12 + 0.015 = 0.135.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.135, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
