To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have information on how often the witness was exposed to each race, which could affect their accuracy. If we assume that the witness's exposure to both races is equal (half white and half black), then their accuracy rate of 80% implies that they are more likely to correctly identify a black person as black than a white person as white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We have:
p(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
p(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
p(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
p(not A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:

p(A|B) = p(B|A) * p(A) / (p(B|A) * p(A) + p(B|not A) * p(not A))

p(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

p(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.23

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 23%.
