Based on the information provided, there are two sources of probabilities we need to consider: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

1. Population distribution: The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

2. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

However, we don't have enough information to determine how this witness's accuracy applies to the specific case of the attacker. The witness could have seen the attacker clearly, or they could have mistakenly identified the attacker based on assumptions or stereotypes. Without knowing this, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the probability of the attacker's race.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to provide a strict estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The given data does not allow for a quantitative calculation.
