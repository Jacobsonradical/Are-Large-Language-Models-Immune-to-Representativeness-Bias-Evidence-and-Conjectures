Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not always reliable in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. Let's call the probability of the witness being correct in this case P.

According to the information, the witness is correct in 80% of their race identification attempts. So, P = 0.8 (probability of witness being correct).

However, since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, there's a possibility that the witness is erring and the attacker is actually white. Let's call the probability of the witness being wrong in this case Q.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate Q as the probability of being wrong when the attacker is white. So, Q = 1 - P * (probability of attacker being white) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.24.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness being correct, which is P = 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8}.
