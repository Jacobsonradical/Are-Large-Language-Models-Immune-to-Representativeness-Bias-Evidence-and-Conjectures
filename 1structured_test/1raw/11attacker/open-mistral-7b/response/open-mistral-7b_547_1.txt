Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15) in the first piece of information.

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 80% (0.8), and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 20% (0.2) as stated in the second piece of information.

Since the witness could not see the attacker's race, we assume that the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is the same as the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the witness couldn't see the race. Therefore, P(B|A) and P(B|not-A) are both 0.2.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
       = [0.2 * 0.15] / [0.2]
       = 0.03

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 3%. However, this is a very low probability, and it's important to note that the witness's identification may not be reliable due to poor lighting conditions or other factors. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
