Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, whose accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider both the city's racial demographics and the witness's reliability.

We know that:
- The attacker's race is either white (with probability 0.85) or black (with probability 0.15).
- The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, so there is an 80% chance they will correctly identify a black attacker as black, and a 20% chance they will mistake a white attacker for a black one.

However, since the witness could not see the attacker's face, they can only provide information about the race based on non-visual cues, such as voice or body build. In this case, we are not given any information about the reliability of these cues.

As a result, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

To give a strict answer in the dictionary format:
{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This answer reflects the uncertainty in the data provided, as we do not have enough information to make a reliable estimate.
