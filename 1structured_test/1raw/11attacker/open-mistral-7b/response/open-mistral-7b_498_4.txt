Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states the probability of an event A given evidence B is the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The probability of A (attacker being black) is given by the population distribution, which is 0.15 (15%).

The probability of B given A (witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (80%).

The probability of A given B (attacker being black given the witness's identification) is what we want to find.

The probability of B given not A (witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).

The probability of not A is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85%).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.8)
= 0.12 / (0.16 + 0.64)
= 0.12 / 0.8
= 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 15%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case in real life. This is a simplification and may not reflect the true probability.
