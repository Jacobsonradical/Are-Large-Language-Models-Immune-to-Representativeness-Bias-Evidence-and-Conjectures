Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The general population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate.

The key here is to account for both the general population composition and the witness's error rate. Since the witness is not 100% accurate, it's likely that some of the attacks they incorrectly identified as black were actually white.

Let's assume that the witness made 20% of their identifications incorrectly. That means they identified 80% of the attackers correctly.

With 80% accuracy, out of 100 attacks they would correctly identify 80 black attackers and 0 white attackers (since they correctly identified them as black). However, out of the 20 incorrect identifications, some of those would be white attackers.

Since the attacker population is 85% white and 15% black, let's say the witness incorrectly identifies 15% of their white attackers as black. This means that out of the 20 incorrect identifications, 3 would be white attackers mistakenly identified as black.

So, out of a total of 100 attacks, the witness correctly identified 80 black attacks and mistakenly identified 3 white attacks as black. This makes a total of 83 attacks identified as black.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness is 80% accurate in identifying black attackers, we would expect that out of 100 attacks, about 85 * 0.8 = 68 attacks would be white, and 15 * 0.8 = 12 attacks would be black.

However, the witness incorrectly identifies some white attacks as black, so the actual number of black attacks recognized is 12 + 3 = 15.

So, the total number of attacks the witness recognized as black is 83. The actual number of black attacks is 15.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is then 15/83.
