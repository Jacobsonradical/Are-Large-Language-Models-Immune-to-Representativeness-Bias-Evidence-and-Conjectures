To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can assume that in 80% of the cases, the actual attacker's race matches the witness's description. However, we cannot ignore the 20% of the times when the witness errs.

In a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, there is a higher likelihood that the majority of people the witness encounters are white. This could potentially skew the witness's judgement, leading to more incorrect identifications of black individuals as white.

To account for this, let's assume that the witness's error rate is higher when judging the race of a minority group (in this case, black individuals) as opposed to the majority group (white individuals). Let's say that the witness's error rate for identifying black individuals is 30% instead of the overall 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (the witness's correct rate) * 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black).

To account for the possible higher error rate, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black:

1. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) * 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white).

Since the witness's description of the attacker as black could actually be a mistake, we need to consider this probability as well.

Now, let's calculate the total probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description:

1. Total probability = (0.8 * 0.15) + [1 - (0.2 * 0.85)] * (0.8 * 0.15)

After calculating, we get a total probability of 0.22 or 22%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability could be different. The witness's error rate when judging race might not be as high as assumed, and the possibility of racial bias in the witness's description should be considered as well.
