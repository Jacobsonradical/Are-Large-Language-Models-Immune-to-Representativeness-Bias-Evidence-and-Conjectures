To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's error rate is 20%, meaning they incorrectly identify a person's race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time.

In the scenario, the witness identified the attacker as black. Given the racial composition of the city, the probability of a random person being black is 15%.

However, we need to account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is truly black, and the witness correctly identified him as such.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying him as black.

In scenario 1, the attacker is indeed black, and the probability of this event is the population probability of black people, which is 15%.

In scenario 2, the attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified him as black. The probability of this event is the population probability of white people multiplied by the witness's error rate, which is 0.85 (85%) times 0.20 (20%), or 0.17 (17%).

Since the attacker can only be either black or white, the probability of scenario 1 or scenario 2 occurring is the sum of their probabilities. So, the total probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (scenario 1) or mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black (scenario 2) is 15% + 0.17 = 0.17 + 0.15 = 0.32 (32%).

This means that, given the witness's testimony and the city's racial demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 32%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified estimation and may not fully account for all potential factors. A more comprehensive analysis would require more detailed information about the witness, the attack, and the city's demographics.
