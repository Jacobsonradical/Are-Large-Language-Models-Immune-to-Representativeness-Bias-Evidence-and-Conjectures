Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker's race, and we have two pieces of evidence:
1. Prior probability of the attacker being black (denoted as P(B)) given by the city's demographics.
2. Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black (denoted as P(W|B)) based on the witness's accuracy.
3. Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (denoted as P(W|not B)) based on the witness's error rate.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony (denoted as P(B|W)) as follows:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Let's break down the components:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (given in the information)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying blacks)
3. P(W|not B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying whites)
4. P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (given in the information)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
