To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct identification and 20% erroneous identification. Since we don't know if the witness made a mistake in this case, we will have to consider both the correct identification and the error.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(WB) as the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as the attacker
- P(WE) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as the attacker

We are given the following information:
1. P(B) + P(W) = 1 (total probability)
2. P(WB) = 0.8 * P(B) (witness's accuracy)
3. P(WE) = 0.2 * P(W) (witness's error)

We also know that the city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. Let's denote:
- P(W) = 0.85

Now we can compute P(B) using the given equations:

P(B) = P(W) / (P(W) + P(B))

P(W) = 0.85

P(W) + P(B) = 1

0.85 + P(B) = 1

P(B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

However, we should also consider the witness's error. The witness identified the attacker as black, so the probability that the witness is correct is P(WB) = 0.8 * P(B). The probability that the witness is erroneous is P(WE) = 0.2 * P(W) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we don't know which one is true, we should consider both cases:

P(attacker is black | witness is correct) * P(witness is correct) + P(attacker is black | witness is erroneous) * P(witness is erroneous)

P(B | WB) * P(WB) + P(B | WE) * P(WE)

Given that the witness's accuracy is 80%, P(B | WB) = 1.

Given that the witness's error is 20%, P(B | WE) is unknown. We can't assume it's 0 or 1, as the attacker's race is not necessarily different in the erroneous case.

To make a conservative estimate, we can assume that the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white is the same as the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black:

P(B | WE) = P(W | WE)

P(B | WE) = 0.15 (city's black population)

Now we can calculate the combined probability:

(1 * 0.8) * 0.8 + (0.15 * x) * 0.2

To find the value of x, we can set the equation equal to the given witness's error rate (0.2) and solve for x:

0.12 + 0.03 * x = 0.2

0.03 * x = 0.04

x = 1.33

This value is not valid since the probability should be between 0 and 1. In this situation, it's not possible to determine a valid probability based on the given information.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: Unable to estimate, the given information does not provide enough certainty}
