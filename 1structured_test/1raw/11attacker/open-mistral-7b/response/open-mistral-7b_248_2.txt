Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about the attacker's race being correct or incorrect in this specific case.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the witness's error rate as a baseline and assume that if the witness made an error, the attacker is likely the opposite race. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can treat this as a correct identification.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can assume that the attacker is black 80% of the time when the witness correctly identifies the race (which is the case here), and the attacker is white 20% of the time when the witness incorrectly identifies the race.

Since we treated the witness's identification as correct, the probability that the attacker is black is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. However, this is an underestimation, because we've assumed that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between correct and incorrect identifications.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability by considering the witness's error rate as a baseline:

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is white is 0.2 (20%), given the city's population distribution.

The probability of the witness being correct given the attacker's race is the product of the probability of the attacker being that race and the probability of the witness being correct given that race.

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 (80%) = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is white is 0.85 (85%) * 0.2 (20%) = 0.17 (17%).

The overall probability of the witness being correct is the sum of these probabilities: 0.12 (12%) + 0.17 (17%) = 0.29 (29%).

Since the witness was correct in this case, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black, which is 0.12 (12%).

However, this interpretation assumes that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between correct and incorrect identifications, which may not be the case. A more accurate estimate would require additional information or a different statistical model.

{probability: 0.12, please note that this estimate may be an underestimation due to the assumptions made}
