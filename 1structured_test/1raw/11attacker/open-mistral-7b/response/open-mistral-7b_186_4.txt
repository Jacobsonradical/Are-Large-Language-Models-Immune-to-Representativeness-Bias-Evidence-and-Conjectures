To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify it 80% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood of each scenario is as follows:

1. P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(black)
2. P(attacker is white | witness identified as black) = P(white)

We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) * 0.8 = P(attacker is black)
P(attacker is white | witness identified as black) * 0.2 = P(attacker is white)

We also know that 85% of the population is white, so:

P(attacker is white) = 0.85

Now we can solve the equation for P(black):

P(black) = P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) * 0.8
P(black) = P(black) * 0.8

Divide both sides by 0.8 to get:
P(black) = 0.8 * P(black)

Solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8, or 80%.
