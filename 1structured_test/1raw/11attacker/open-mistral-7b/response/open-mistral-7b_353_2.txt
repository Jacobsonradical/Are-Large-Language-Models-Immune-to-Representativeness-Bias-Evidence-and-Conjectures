To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial distribution of the population.

The witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying the race.

We know that 85% of the population is white, so the probability of the second scenario is 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white). The probability of the first scenario is thus 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black).

However, the witness errs 20% of the time. In the first scenario, the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race, so this scenario doesn't contribute to the error rate. In the second scenario, the witness mistakes a white attacker for a black one, which is an error.

So, the probability of the witness making an error in the second scenario is the error rate of 0.2. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is the error rate multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race: 0.15 * 1 = 0.15.

However, this doesn't take into account the original racial distribution of the population. Since there are more white people in the population, it's more likely that a randomly chosen person is white. So, the probability that the witness's identification is correct, given the racial distribution, is less than the probability of the attacker being black: 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.47.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.47 (approximately 47%).
