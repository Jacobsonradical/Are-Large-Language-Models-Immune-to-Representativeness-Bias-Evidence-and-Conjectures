To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) can be calculated using the total probability rule: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  P(E|not H) = 0.2 (witness correctly identifies white people 20% of the time)
  P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
  So, P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
  Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.1855

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.1855 â‰ˆ 0.3225

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.32 or 32.25%.
