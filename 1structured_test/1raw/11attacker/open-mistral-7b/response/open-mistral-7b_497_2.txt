Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability: They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we should consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a white person as black.

The probability of this happening can be calculated using the witness's error rate of 20%.

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's error, would be:

{probability: 0.2, this means the attacker is likely white 20% of the time}

But since we are looking for the probability that the attacker is black, we can subtract this value from 1:

{probability: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, this means the attacker is likely black 80% of the time}

So, based on the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.
