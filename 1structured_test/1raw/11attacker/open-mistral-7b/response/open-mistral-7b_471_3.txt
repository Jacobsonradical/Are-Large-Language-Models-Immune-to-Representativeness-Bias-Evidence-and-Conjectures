Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. But since the witness's accuracy is not perfect, there is a chance that the witness made an error.
4. To account for this possibility, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of being incorrect when the attacker is white is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
5. Now, if the attacker is actually white and the witness incorrectly identifies him as black, the witness's statement would be contradicting the majority racial composition of the city (85% white). This seems highly unlikely.
6. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate when the attacker is white is lower than 20%. Let's say it's 10% (for simplicity).
7. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the complement of the probability that the witness made an error when the attacker is white. In other words, it's 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.
8. However, since the witness's accuracy is not perfect, this estimate might be an overestimate. To account for the possibility of the witness making an error when the attacker is black, we can multiply this probability by the ratio of the witness's accuracy when the attacker is black to the witness's overall accuracy.
9. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of being incorrect when the attacker is black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
10. The ratio of the witness's accuracy when the attacker is black to the witness's overall accuracy is 0.8 / 0.8 = 1.
11. Therefore, the final estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is 0.9 * 1 = 0.9.

Answer: {probability: 0.9}
