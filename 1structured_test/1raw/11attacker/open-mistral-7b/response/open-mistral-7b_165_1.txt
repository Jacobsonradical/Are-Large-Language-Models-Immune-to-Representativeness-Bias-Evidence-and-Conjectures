To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistakes in identifying a black person as a white person and vice versa, then the probability of an error given that the attacker is black is equal to the probability of an error given that the attacker is white.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(W) be the probability that the witness is correct. Then, we have:

P(B) = P(W | B) * P(B) + P(~W | B) * P(~B)

where ~W means the witness is incorrect, and ~B means the attacker is white.

We know that P(W | B) = 0.8 and P(W | ~B) = 0.2. We also know that P(B) + P(~B) = 1.

We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, so P(B) = 0.15 and P(~B) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.15 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
