Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% accurate, meaning they err 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as black. This means that if the attacker was actually white (which would be the more likely case given the city's demographics), the witness would have erred in their identification.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's error rate. Since we know the witness made an error, we can't directly apply the city's demographics. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probabilities given new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is proportional to the probability of B given A, multiplied by the prior probability of A:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is black (which we can get from the city's demographics), and P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black (which we know is 80% accurate).

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is black:

P(B|A) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is white (which would be an error):

P(B|not-A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

Now, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A):

P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's demographics)

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker's race:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)

P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the city's demographics)

Plugging these values into the equation:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
