Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our prior beliefs (in this case, the population composition) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the reliability of the witness (0.8 or 80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the city's black population, 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of B, which can be calculated using the witness's reliability and the prior probability of A and its opposite (P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)). Since we don't have the reliability of the witness when identifying a white person, we can't calculate P(B) directly. Instead, we'll use a simplification that assumes the witness is equally reliable for both races. In this case, the witness would be incorrect 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

The simplified formula for P(B) then becomes: P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.37

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.37, or 37%.
