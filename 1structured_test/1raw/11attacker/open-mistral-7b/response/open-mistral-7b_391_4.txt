To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence: the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In our problem:
- P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is black. We don't have this information, so we'll assume it's unknown.
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, this is 0.8.
- P(E|not H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
- P(E): the probability of the witness making the statement E. This is the sum of the probabilities of making the statement given that H and given that not H: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We don't have P(H), but we can write P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city) and P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get: P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.62

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.62, or 62%.
