Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's statement suggests that the attacker is likely to be black, but we need to quantify this probability using Bayes' theorem.

The theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the conditional probability, P(B|A) is the likelihood, P(A) is the prior probability, and P(B) is the marginal likelihood.

In our case, event A is the attacker being black (A=black), event B is the witness's statement (B=witness statement), P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(B) is the probability of the witness statement given the attacker being black or white.

The likelihood P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would make the statement given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this likelihood is 0.8.

The prior probability P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness statement. Given the city's population distribution, this probability is 0.15 (15%).

The posterior probability P(A|B) is what we're interested in. It is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) is the probability of the witness statement given either the attacker being black or white. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness statement given a white attacker is also 0.8 (given the witness's 80% accuracy). Therefore, the probability of the witness statement given an attacker being white is 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.212

So, given the witness statement and the city's population distribution, the probability of the attacker being black is approximately 21.2%. This is significantly lower than the witness's statement, suggesting that despite the witness's statement, there is still reasonable doubt about the attacker's race based on this information alone.
