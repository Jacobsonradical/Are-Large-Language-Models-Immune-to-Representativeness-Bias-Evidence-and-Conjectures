To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's statement and the demographics of the city).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the evidence, which is the witness's statement and the demographics

Let's break down the components:

1. P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't have specific data, we'll use the city's demographics as an approximation: 15% (0.15).

2. P(B|A): Likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black. The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. So, the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

3. P(B): The probability of the witness's statement, regardless of the attacker's race. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. The probability of seeing a black person is 0.15. So, P(B) = 0.85P(A) + 0.15P(not A) = 0.85 * 0.15 + 0.15 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.1265.

4. P(A|B): This is what we want to find.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.1265
      = 0.12 * 1.2
      = 0.144

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.144 or 14.4%.
