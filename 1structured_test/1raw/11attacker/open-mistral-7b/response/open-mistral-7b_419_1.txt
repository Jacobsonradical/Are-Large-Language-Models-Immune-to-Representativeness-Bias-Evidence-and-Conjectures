The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B).

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a non-black person)
4. P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
