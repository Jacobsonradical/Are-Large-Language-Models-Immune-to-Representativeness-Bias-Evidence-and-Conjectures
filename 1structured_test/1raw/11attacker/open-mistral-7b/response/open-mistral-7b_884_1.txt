Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, but we know that 85% of the city's population is white. This means that the probability of the attacker being white, based on the city's demographics, is higher than the probability of the attacker being black.

However, we also know that the witness is not perfectly reliable. Given the witness's error rate and the fact that they identified the attacker as black, the probability that they were incorrect in their identification and the attacker is actually white is 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and their error rate, is 1 - the probability that they were incorrect in their identification and the attacker is white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We can set up an equation based on the given information:

P(black) = 1 - P(white | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is correct) + P(white | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is incorrect)

P(white | witness's identification) is the conditional probability of the attacker being white, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that they are incorrectly identifying whites as black 20% of the time. So, P(white | witness's identification) = 0.8 (since 80% of the time they are correct about the attacker being black).

P(witness's identification is correct) is the probability that the witness is correct in their identification, and this is given as 0.8.

P(witness's identification is incorrect) is the probability that the witness is incorrect in their identification, and this is 1 - P(witness's identification is correct) = 0.2.

P(white) is the probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 0.85.

P(black | witness's identification) is the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. We are trying to find this probability, so let's denote it as P(black | witness's identification).

We can now set up the equation:

P(black | witness's identification) = 1 - P(white | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is correct) + P(white | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is incorrect)

Substituting the values we have:

P(black | witness's identification) = 1 - (0.8) * (0.8) + (0.8) * (0.2)

Calculating this gives us:

P(black | witness's identification) â‰ˆ 0.57

So, given the witness's identification and their error rate, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 57%. However, this probability is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant for all races, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
