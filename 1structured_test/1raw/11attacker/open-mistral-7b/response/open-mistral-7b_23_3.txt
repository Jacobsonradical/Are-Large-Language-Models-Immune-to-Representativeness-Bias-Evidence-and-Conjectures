Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not always reliable in identifying races, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability that the attacker is black times the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.

The probability of the second scenario is the probability that the attacker is white times the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. Probability that the attacker is black: 15% (since 15% of the population is black)
2. Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person: 0.8 (80% of the time)
3. Probability that the attacker is white: 1 - Probability that the attacker is black = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
4. Probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person: 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of the two scenarios:

1. Probability of the first scenario: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. Probability of the second scenario: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Finally, let's calculate the total probability that the witness identified the attacker correctly:

Total probability = Probability of the first scenario + Probability of the second scenario = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
