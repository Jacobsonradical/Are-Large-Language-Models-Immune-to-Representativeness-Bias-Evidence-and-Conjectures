To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- ~H: The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the city's demographics: P(H) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is given by the witness's accuracy: P(E|H) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white) is given by the witness's error rate: P(E|~H) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4 (since the witness is wrong half the time when the attacker is white).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities weighted by their prior probabilities: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.4 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.34 = 0.58.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.58 â‰ˆ 0.19

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.19 or 19%.
