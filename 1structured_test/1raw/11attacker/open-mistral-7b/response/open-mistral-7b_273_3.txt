Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how accurate the witness was in this specific case. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this instance, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black with certainty.

To estimate the probability, we can consider the witness's error rate as a potential source of uncertainty. If we assume that the witness made an error in this case (i.e., they identified the attacker as black when the attacker was actually white), then the probability of the attacker being black would be 15%, which is the proportion of the population that is black.

On the other hand, if we assume that the witness was correct in their identification, then the probability of the attacker being black would be higher than 15%, but we don't have enough information to calculate this probability precisely.

Therefore, given the information available, a conservative estimate would be to use the 15% probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics, as this is the minimum probability if the witness made an error.
