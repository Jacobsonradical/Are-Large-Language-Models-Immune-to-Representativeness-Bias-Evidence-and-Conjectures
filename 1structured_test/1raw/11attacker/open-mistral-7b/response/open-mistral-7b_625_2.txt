Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of H (P(H)) is given as 15% in the city's population.
The likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)) is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person, which is 80%.
The likelihood of E given not H (P(E|~H)) is the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a white person, which is 20%.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plug in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculate:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 24%.
