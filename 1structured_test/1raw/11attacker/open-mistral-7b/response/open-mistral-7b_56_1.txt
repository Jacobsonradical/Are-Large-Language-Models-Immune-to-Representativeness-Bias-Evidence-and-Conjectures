To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness's identification is correct.
2. The attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness has made an error.

The probability of the first scenario (the attacker is black) is the probability that the witness's identification is correct given that the attacker is black. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8) times the probability of the attacker being black (which we are trying to find).

The probability of the second scenario (the attacker is white) is the probability that the witness makes an error given that the attacker is white. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person (0.2) times the probability of the attacker being white (0.15).

Since these are mutually exclusive events (the attacker can't be both black and white), we can find the probability that the attacker is black by adding the probabilities of the two scenarios and subtracting the probability of both scenarios happening (which would be double-counting).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29}.
