Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2) A witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate (correctly identifying a person as black 80% of the time) and 20% inaccurate (erroneously identifying a person as black 20% of the time).

The witness reported seeing a black attacker, but the victim could not see the race of the attacker. We cannot directly use the racial composition of the city here because the victim's observation is not available. Instead, we have to consider the witness's reliability and their potential error in identifying the attacker's race.

Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we must account for this probability in our estimate. If we assume that the witness is equally likely to err in identifying both white and black attackers, the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect is the same as the probability that the witness errs in identifying a black attacker as white.

Therefore, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct is 1 - the probability that the witness errs in identifying a black attacker as white.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

However, we cannot directly apply this probability to the racial composition of the city because we do not know the actual race of the attacker. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, A = the attacker is black, B = the witness identifies the attacker as black.

The formula for this would be:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have three probabilities needed to calculate this:

1) P(A) = the probability that the attacker is black, which we are trying to find.
2) P(B|A) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which was already given as 0.8.
3) P(B) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race.

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

We can rearrange this equation to find P(A):

P(A) = [P(B) - 0.2 * (1 - P(A))] / 0.8

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

P(A) = [0.8 - 0.2 * (1 - P(A))] / 0.8

0.8P(A) = 0.8 - 0.2

P(A) = 0.6 / 0.8 = 0.75

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, is 0.75 or 75%.
