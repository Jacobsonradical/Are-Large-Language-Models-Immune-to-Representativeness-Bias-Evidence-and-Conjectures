Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

First, let's consider the city's demographics: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Next, we need to account for the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should assume that the error rate applies to misidentifying a white person as black.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness made a mistake. We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so the probability of this event occurring is the probability of the witness erring multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white.

The probability of the witness erring is 0.2 (20%). The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%).

So, the probability of the witness making a mistake is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

This means that the probability of the witness not making a mistake and correctly identifying the attacker as black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness correctly identified the attacker but simply gave an incorrect race. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker and the attacker being black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities we calculated above.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83 (from the witness not making a mistake) + 0.12 (from the witness correctly identifying the attacker) = 0.95 (95%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.95}
