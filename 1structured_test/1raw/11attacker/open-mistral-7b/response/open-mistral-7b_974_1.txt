Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness's incorrect identification (which is 20% of the time) occurred in this case.

The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. But we need to account for the witness's error rate. So, the actual probability of the attacker being black is the error rate (which is 20% or 0.2) multiplied by the proportion of the population that is black (which is 0.15).

Therefore, {probability: 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 3%}. It's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and real-world situations can deviate from statistical models.
