To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle used in statistics and probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case,
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness's identification.

We have the following information:
1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is unknown but can be estimated based on the racial composition of the city. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can estimate P(A) as 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8.
3. P(B|A^c) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can estimate P(B|A^c) as 0.2.
4. P(A^c) is the prior probability of the attacker being non-black (white in this case), which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|A^c) * P(A^c).

We can now compute P(B) and then use Bayes' theorem to estimate P(A|B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.4815

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
