To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior probabilities and conditional probabilities. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability of the attacker being black (P(A=black)) given the observed evidence (P(W=black|A=black) and P(W=black|A=white)).

Here's how to break it down:

1. Prior probability: This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume that the attacker is equally likely to be black or white. Therefore, P(A=black) = 0.5.

2. Likelihood: This is the probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. We know from the first piece of information that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identifies the attacker as black, the likelihood is P(W=black|A=black) = 0.8.

3. Prior probability of evidence: This is the probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability is P(W=black|A=white) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence using Bayes' theorem:

P(A=black|W=black) = [P(W=black|A=black) * P(A=black)] / [P(W=black|A=black) * P(A=black) + P(W=black|A=white) * P(A=white)]

Substituting the values:

P(A=black|W=black) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]

Calculating the probability:

P(A=black|W=black) â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.64 or 64%.
