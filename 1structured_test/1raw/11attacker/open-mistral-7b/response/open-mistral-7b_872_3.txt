Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. Let's denote the true race of the attacker as R (either 'white' or 'black'). The witness's incorrect identification rate is 20%, so their correct identification rate is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80%.

Given the population distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black if the attacker is indeed black. Since the population is 15% black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of a correct identification by the witness, given the attacker is black, is p(attacker is black | witness is correct) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

On the other hand, since the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Given the witness's incorrect identification rate of 20%, the probability of a false identification by the witness, given the attacker is white, is p(attacker is white | witness is incorrect) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability of this event given the truth of each possible attacker race:

p(witness is correct | attacker is black) = 0.12
p(witness is incorrect | attacker is white) = 0.17

Since the witness made an identification, the total probability of either event happening is the sum of the probabilities of each event:

p(witness is correct or witness is incorrect) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

However, since the witness made an identification, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

p(attacker is black | witness is correct or witness is incorrect) = p(witness is correct | attacker is black) * p(attacker is black) / p(witness is correct or witness is incorrect)

p(attacker is black | witness is correct or witness is incorrect) = (0.12) * (0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.044 or 4.4%

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is around 4.4%. This estimate takes into account both the racial distribution of the population and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.
