To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker is indeed black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as such is 0.8. Conversely, if the attacker is white, the probability that the witness erroneously identifies them as black is 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 and the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (0.8) times the probability that the attacker is black in the population (0.15), plus the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white attacker as black (0.2) times the probability that the attacker is white in the population (0.85).

So the probability that the attacker is black is (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
