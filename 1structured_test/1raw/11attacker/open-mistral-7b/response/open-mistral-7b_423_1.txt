Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be:

{
  "probability": 0.8
}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as black.
3. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race and found that they correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
4. Since the witness's identification of the attacker as black fits within the range of their typical error rate, it is reasonable to consider this identification as potentially accurate.
5. Therefore, given the witness's identification and error rate, we estimate that the probability of the attacker being black is 0.8.
