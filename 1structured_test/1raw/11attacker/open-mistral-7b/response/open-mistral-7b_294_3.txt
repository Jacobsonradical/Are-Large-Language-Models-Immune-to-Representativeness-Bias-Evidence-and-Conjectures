To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate, and they have erroneously identified someone as black 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is truly black. In this case, the witness correctly identified the race. The probability of this happening is the true proportion of black people in the city multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying black people. So, the probability is 0.15 (the proportion of black people) * 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.

2. The attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified them as black. The probability of this happening is the proportion of white people in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying black people. So, the probability is 0.85 (the proportion of white people) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate) = 0.17 or 17%.

Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black: 0.12 (probability of scenario 1) + 0.17 (probability of scenario 2) = 0.29 or 29%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
