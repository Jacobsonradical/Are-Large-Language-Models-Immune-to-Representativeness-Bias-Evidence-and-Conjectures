Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(B) = 0.85 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.32 (the witness makes an error 20% of the time, so the probability of them identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85, and the probability of them identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.28125

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.28 or 28%. This is significantly lower than the witness's initial identification, indicating that the witness may have been mistaken or biased in their identification. However, it is still higher than the actual population percentage of black people in the city. This suggests that while the witness may have been wrong or biased, their identification of the attacker as black is not completely arbitrary and should be taken into consideration.
