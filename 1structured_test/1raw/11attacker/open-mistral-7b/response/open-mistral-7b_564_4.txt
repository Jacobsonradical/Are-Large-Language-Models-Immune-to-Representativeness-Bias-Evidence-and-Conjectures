Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifying a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's identification being correct, regardless of the attacker's race)

To calculate P(E), we can use the total probability theorem:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Where:
- P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(not H) is the probability of the attacker being white (which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.204 â‰ˆ 0.586

So, based on the witness's identification and the prior probability of the attacker being black, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.586, or 58.6%.
