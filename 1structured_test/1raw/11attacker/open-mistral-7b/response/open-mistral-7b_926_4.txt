Given the information provided, the probability estimate of the attacker being black is:

{
  "probability": 0.8
}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have information about a witness who identified the attacker as black. This witness was found to be correct in 80% of their race judgments, and incorrect in 20% of their judgments.
3. Since we cannot rely on the victim's description of the attacker's race, we must rely on the witness's description.
4. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black, which aligns with their ability to correctly identify race 80% of the time.
5. Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and their demonstrated ability to accurately identify race, we estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of 80%.
