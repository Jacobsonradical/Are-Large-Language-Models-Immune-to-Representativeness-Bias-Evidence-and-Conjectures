Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we do not have information about the race of the people the witness was observing in the sample used to assess their ability. If the sample was biased towards one race, the 80% accuracy rate might not accurately reflect the witness's ability to identify the attacker's race.

Without this information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. But if we assume the sample was representative of the population, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate an estimate.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Similarly, let P(B|not A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

The Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not A) = 0.15 (since P(A) + P(not A) = 1), we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, given these assumptions, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
