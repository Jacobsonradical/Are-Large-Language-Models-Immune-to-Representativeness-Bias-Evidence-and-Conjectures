To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black) = 0.2 (since the attacker is white, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(A|B) (the probability we are interested in) = ?

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.36.

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.36}
