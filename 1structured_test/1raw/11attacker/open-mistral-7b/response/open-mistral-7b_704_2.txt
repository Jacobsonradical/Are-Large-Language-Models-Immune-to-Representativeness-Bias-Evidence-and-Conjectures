To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down these probabilities:

1. P(H) (prior probability of the attacker being black) is unknown, but we can estimate it based on the city's demographics. From information "b", 15% of the city's population is black.

2. P(E|H) (probability of the evidence given the hypothesis) is the accuracy of the witness in identifying black people, which is 80%.

3. P(E) (probability of the evidence) is the total probability of the witness making the identified observation, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the total probability of the evidence is 80% (correct) + 20% (incorrect).

4. P(not H) (prior probability of the attacker being white) is 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (given in information "b")

5. P(E|not H) (probability of the evidence given the hypothesis of the attacker being white) is the accuracy of the witness in identifying white people, which is also 80% (as given in information "a").

Now let's put these probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.68

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1765 (probability that the attacker is black, rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.65%.
