To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). According to the information given, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. So, P(black) = 0.15.

The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, there are two possibilities: either the witness is correct (P(correct|black)), or the witness is incorrect but mistakenly identifies the attacker as black (P(incorrect|not black)).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(black|identified as black) = [P(identified as black|black) * P(black)] / [P(identified as black|black) * P(black) + P(identified as black|not black) * P(not black)]

In this case, P(identified as black|black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time), P(black) = 0.15, P(identified as black|not black) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies non-black people 20% of the time), and P(not black) = 0.85 (since the city's population is 85% white).

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(black|identified as black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.164 = 0.7347

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.7347 or 73.47%.
