Given the two pieces of information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis, which we don't have enough information to calculate directly)

We can't calculate P(E) directly, but we can rewrite Bayes' theorem to make it proportional to P(E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

We also don't have the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black (P(E|not H)), but we can make an assumption that the witness is no better at identifying the race of white people than black people (i.e., they also correctly identify a white person as white 80% of the time), so P(E|not H) = 0.8.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.256

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 25.6%.
