Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for calculating conditional probabilities, and it can be used to update beliefs based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the race 20% of the time, where ~A represents the event that the attacker is not black).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41%.
