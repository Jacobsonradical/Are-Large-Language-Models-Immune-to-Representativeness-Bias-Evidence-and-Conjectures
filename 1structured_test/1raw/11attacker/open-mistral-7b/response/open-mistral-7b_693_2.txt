Given the information provided, the attacker was initially described as being of unknown race by the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The accuracy of the witness's race identification is known to be 80% under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem can be used to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy of identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (which is not provided in the information given)

We know the values of P(E|H) and P(H), but we don't have enough information to calculate P(E). However, we can make an estimate of P(H|E) based on the given information.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is 0.8 (80%), as the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black.

The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is 0.15 (15%), as 15% of the population in the city is black.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / [unknown P(E)] â‰ˆ 0.12}

However, since we don't have enough information to calculate P(E), this is an approximate estimate. It suggests that, given the witness's identification, there is a probability of approximately 12% that the attacker is black, according to Bayes' theorem.
