Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E is the evidence, which is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (or 0.15).
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the person is actually black. This is given as 80% (or 0.8).
- P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the person is actually not black. Since the population is 85% white, and the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is given as 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the actual race. This can be calculated as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.205.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using the formula:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.58

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 58%.
