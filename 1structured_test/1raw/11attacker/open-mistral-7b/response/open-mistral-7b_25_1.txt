To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(B).

The witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time. Since they are equally likely to err in identifying white people as black, the probability of them correctly identifying a white person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85 and that of encountering a black person is 0.15.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is P(B) * 0.8, and the probability that they incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they are correct is P(B) * 0.8, and the probability that they are wrong is 0.17.

The court's assessment of the witness's reliability tells us that the probability of their incorrect identification being a false positive is 0.2. In other words, if the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black, there is a 20% chance that this person is actually white.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness made a false positive is 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.034.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is P(B) * 0.8 - 0.034.

We do not have a direct way to solve for P(B) from this information, but we can express it as a function of the unknown:

P(B) = [P(B) * 0.8 - 0.034] / 0.8

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) â‰ˆ 0.431 or 43.1%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 43.1%.
