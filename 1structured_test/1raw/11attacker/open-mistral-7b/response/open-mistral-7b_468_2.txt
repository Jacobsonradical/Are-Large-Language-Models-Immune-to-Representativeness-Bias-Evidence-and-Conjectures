Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: the attacker is black (H1) and the attacker is white (H2). We have one piece of evidence: the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let P(H1) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

Let P(H2) be the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 85% or 0.85.

Let P(E|H1) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8.

Let P(E|H2) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2 (since the witness is correct in identifying white people 80% of the time).

According to Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of H1 given E (P(H1|E)) is:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being black of approximately 0.26 or 26%.

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: 0.26}
