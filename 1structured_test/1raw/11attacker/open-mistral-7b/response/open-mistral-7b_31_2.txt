Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% when the population is equally divided between whites and blacks. However, the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's consider two scenarios:

1. Scenario A: If the attacker is black, the probability that the witness will misidentify the race is 20%. In this case, the attacker would be one of the 15% black population, and the witness would err 20% of the time.

2. Scenario B: If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness will incorrectly identify the race as black is also 20%. In this case, the attacker would be one of the 85% white population, but the witness would still err 20% of the time.

Since the witness has an equal chance of erring in both scenarios, we can consider their error as a "noise" that does not change the actual distribution of races in the city. Therefore, the relative probabilities of the attacker being black or white in the city population still apply.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (as per the city's population distribution). However, considering the witness's error, we cannot rule out that the attacker might have been misidentified as black. To account for this uncertainty, we can calculate an adjusted probability.

Given that the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification is correct is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and black people make up 15% of the city's population, the adjusted probability that the attacker is indeed black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.
