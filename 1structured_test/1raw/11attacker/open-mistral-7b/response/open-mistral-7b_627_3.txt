Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's find the prior probability P(H):
Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is P(H) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis P(E|H):
Since the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Now, let's find the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is white P(E|~H):
Since the witness is less accurate in identifying whites, let's assume that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time. So, P(E|~H) = 0.7.

Finally, let's find the probability of the evidence P(E):
Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.7 * P(~H) = 0.12 + 0.56 * 0.15 = 0.192.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.192 = 0.2075

So, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2075 or 20.75%.
