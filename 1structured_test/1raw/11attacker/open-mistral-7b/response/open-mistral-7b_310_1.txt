To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Since the witness misidentified the race, we should consider the possibility of both the attacker being black and the witness making an error.

The probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the race is 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) = 0.12.

The probability of the attacker being white and the witness mistakenly identifying the race as black is 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17.

The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Since the witness's identification is likely to be incorrect when the attacker is white, we should subtract the probability of the attacker being white and the witness correctly identifying the race from the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black: 0.29 - 0.17 = 0.12.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12.
