Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race.
3. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the initial distribution of race in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(WB) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker
- P(WWB) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker and the attacker is indeed black

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time, we have P(WB) = 0.8.

Since the witness's accuracy is dependent on the actual race of the attacker, we can calculate P(WWB) as the product of the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(B)) and the witness's probability of correctly identifying a black attacker (P(WB)):
P(WWB) = P(B) * P(WB)

According to Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is equal to the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black, multiplied by the prior probability of the attacker being black, divided by the sum of the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black and the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black attacker 20% of the time, we have P(W|~B) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.224}
