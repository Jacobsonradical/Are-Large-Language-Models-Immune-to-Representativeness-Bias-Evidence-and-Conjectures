Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

1. We know that 85% of the population is white, which means P(white) = 0.85.
2. The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect. This means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can represent this event as W = {witness correctly identified black attacker} = {attacker is black} âˆ© {witness correctly identifies race}.
4. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is P(W) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black).
5. Substituting the values, we get P(W) = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2.
6. We also know that the probability of the witness making an error is P(W^c) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness correctly identifies white).
7. Substituting the values, we get P(W^c) = P(black) * 0.2 + P(white) * 0.8.
8. Since P(W) + P(W^c) = 1, we can write the equation P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 = P(black) and solve for P(black): P(black) = P(W) / 0.8 = (P(W) - P(W^c)) / (0.8 - 0.2) = [P(W) - P(black) * 0.2 - P(white) * 0.8] / 0.6.

However, the given information does not allow us to compute the exact value of P(W). We can only provide an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

{probability: 0.63, this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions}
