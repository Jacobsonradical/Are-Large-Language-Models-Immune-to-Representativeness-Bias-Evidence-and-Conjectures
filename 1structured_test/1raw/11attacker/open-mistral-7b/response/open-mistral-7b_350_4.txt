To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (incorrectly identifying race). Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 0.8 (80%) chance that the attacker is actually black, and a 0.2 (20%) chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is white.

However, we also know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. If the witness's identification is correct, it doesn't change the actual racial demographics of the city. But if the witness is wrong, it would change the apparent demographics, making it seem like there are more black people than there actually are.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given the city's demographics. If the attacker is white, there is a 0.85 chance that the witness would mistakenly identify him as black, and a 0.15 chance that she would correctly identify him as white.

So, the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being white is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct plus the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being white, multiplied by the actual probability of the attacker being white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.146 = 0.266, or 26.6%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.266} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
