To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the demographic information about the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race. Probability of this scenario is 0.8 (the probability of correct identification).
2. The attacker is white, and the witness erroneously identified the race. Probability of this scenario is 0.15 (the proportion of white population) * 0.2 (the probability of error in identifying whites as black), or 0.03.

The total probability of both scenarios is the sum of their individual probabilities: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black makes it impossible for the attacker to be white. Therefore, we should only consider the scenario where the attacker is black, and the probability is 0.8.
