To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. If the attacker's race is actually white (the majority in the city), then the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as black is the error rate of 20%.

Conversely, if the attacker's race is black (the minority in the city), then the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black is the reliability rate of 80%.

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black by considering these two scenarios:

1. If the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 0.8.
2. If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black is 0.2.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of scenario 1 (the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies) divided by the sum of probabilities of both scenarios 1 and 2 (the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies, or the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies):

{probability: 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2), probability: 0.8 / 1.0, probability: 0.8}
