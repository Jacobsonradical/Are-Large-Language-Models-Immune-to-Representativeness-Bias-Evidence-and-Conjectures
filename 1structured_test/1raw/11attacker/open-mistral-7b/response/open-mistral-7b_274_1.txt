To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two races, then the error rate for each race is 20% / 2 = 10%.

Given this error rate, we can calculate the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = Correct identification rate
                                                                          = 0.8

However, the witness's identification is not the only information we have. We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This information can help us to calculate the prior probability that the attacker is black, P(attacker is black), which is the probability we are interested in.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identified as black)

Given the information we have, we can assume that the probability of a witness identifying a black person as black is equal to the witness's correct identification rate, 0.8. Therefore, we can write:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) / [0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.1 * P(attacker is white)]

We are given that P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 0.15. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) / [0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.1 * 0.15]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) / 0.112

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we can solve for P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.112 / 0.8 = 0.112

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.112 or 11.2%. This is significantly lower than the witness's identification, suggesting that the witness may have made an error in their identification.
