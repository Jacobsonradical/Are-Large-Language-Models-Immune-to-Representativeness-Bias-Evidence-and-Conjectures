Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is actually higher than the witness's initial assumption.

To calculate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use the Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is black,
- B is the witness's observation that the attacker is black,
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find,
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness observing a black attacker given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (80%),
- P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the witness observing a black attacker given that the attacker is not black, which is assumed to be the error rate, 0.2 (20%),
- P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(A), or 0.85 (85% white population),
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability, which is what we're looking for.

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 66%.
