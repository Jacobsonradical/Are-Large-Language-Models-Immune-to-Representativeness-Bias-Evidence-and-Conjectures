Given the two pieces of information provided:

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.

The witness's statement about the attacker being black might be correct or an error. We can calculate the probability of both scenarios and then use Bayes' theorem to find the estimated probability of the attacker being black.

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(WB) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker (true positive).
- P(WA) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black (false positive).
- P(W) as the probability that the witness makes an observation. In this case, since the witness was there, P(W) = 1.

We are given that P(B) = 0.15, P(WB) = 0.8, and P(WA) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness made an observation.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

Since we know P(W) = 1 and we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we have:

P(W|B) = P(B|W)

So, the equation simplifies to:

P(B|W) = P(B|W) * P(B)

Now we can solve for P(B|W) by assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is the same for black and white people:

P(W|B) = P(W|A) = 0.8

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account the witness's error rate and the population distribution in the city. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and actual events may deviate from these probabilities.
