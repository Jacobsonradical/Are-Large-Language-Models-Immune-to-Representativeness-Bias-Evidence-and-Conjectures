To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (80%).
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (20%).
- P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (the attacker is either black or not black, so their probability must add up to 1).

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the evidence is W. We want to find P(B|W). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We have the values of P(W|B) (0.8) and P(W|~B) (0.2), as well as the population distribution P(B) = 0.15 (from piece b) and P(~B) = 0.85.

Calculating P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.25 = 0.48

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.48 or 48%.
