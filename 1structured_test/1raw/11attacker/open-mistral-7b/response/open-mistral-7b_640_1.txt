To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the overall frequency of black people in the city)

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) = ? (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)

Where ~H represents the opposite of H, i.e., the attacker is not black.

To find P(H), we can use the law of total probability:

P(H) = [P(H and E)] / P(E) + [P(H and ~E)] / P(~E)

Since we don't have the information about P(H and ~E), we can't directly find P(H). However, we can make an assumption about the likelihood of the attacker being black and then calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence.

Let's assume that before considering the evidence, we believe that the attacker is equally likely to be black or white. This means P(H) = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
         = [0.8 * 0.5] / 0.15
         = 0.4

So, based on the witness's testimony and the assumption that the attacker is equally likely to be black or white before considering the evidence, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4 or 40%.

However, this is just an estimate. In a more rigorous analysis, we would need more information, such as the error rate of the witness when identifying white people and the actual distribution of attackers in the city.
