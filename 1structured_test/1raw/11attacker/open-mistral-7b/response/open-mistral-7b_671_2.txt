Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker being specifically white, we can assume that the witness's observation of the attacker being "black" could be an accurate identification or an error.

Let's calculate the probabilities of both events:

1. The attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies the race: Probability = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12

2. The attacker is black and the witness makes an error: Probability = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.03

3. The attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies the race: Probability = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Since we don't have any information suggesting that the attacker is white, we can assume that the witness's observation of the attacker being "black" is either a correct identification or an error due to misidentifying a white person. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being black would be the sum of the probabilities in the first two cases:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15}

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
