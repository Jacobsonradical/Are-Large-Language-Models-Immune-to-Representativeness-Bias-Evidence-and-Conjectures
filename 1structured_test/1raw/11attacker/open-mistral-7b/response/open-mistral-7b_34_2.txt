To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness errs on a white person is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

This means that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% - 17% = 63% of the time.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

The probability that the witness correctly identified a black person is 0.63 * 0.15 = 0.0945 or 9.45%.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's identification. This is the conditional probability, which can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies as black) = P(Witness identifies as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness identifies as black)

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, and since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness made a correct identification is 0.8.

Therefore, the conditional probability is:

0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15 or 15%.

This means that, given the witness's identification, there is a 15% probability that the attacker is black. This estimate takes into account the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.
