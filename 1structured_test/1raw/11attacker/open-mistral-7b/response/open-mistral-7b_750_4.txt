Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker's race being black. The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15 in decimal.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (from "half white and half black, the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time").
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2 (from "half white and half black, the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time").
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85 or 85%.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, based on the given information, the probability estimate that the attacker is black is approximately 32%.
