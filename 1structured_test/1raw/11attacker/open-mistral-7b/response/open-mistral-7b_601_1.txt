Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, then the probability of the witness making an error when identifying the attacker's race should be the same as the error rate.

The error rate means that in 20% of cases, the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black. Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is higher than that of a black person. Therefore, the mistake of identifying a white person as black is more likely to happen than the mistake of identifying a black person as white.

However, knowing that the witness made an error, we cannot determine whether the error was identifying a white person as black or a black person as white. Therefore, the error rate provides us with an upper bound for the probability that the attacker is black.

The probability that the attacker is black is at least 15% (the actual proportion of black people in the city), and it could be higher if the error was identifying a black person as white. Since we cannot determine the exact error that was made, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information is {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
