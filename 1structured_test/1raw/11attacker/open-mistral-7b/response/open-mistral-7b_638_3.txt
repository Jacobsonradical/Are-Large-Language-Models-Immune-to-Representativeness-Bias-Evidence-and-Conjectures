Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The city's racial distribution: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability: They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider both the possibility that they are correct and the possibility that they are mistaken.

The probability of the witness being correct is directly related to their reliability, which is 80%. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to consider the possibility that the witness made an error. Since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can't directly calculate the probability of the witness being wrong. But we can infer this probability from the racial distribution of the city.

If the attacker is white (which makes up 85% of the population), then the witness has a 20% chance of erring in identifying the attacker as black.

Therefore, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, by subtracting the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, from 1:

Probability of attacker being white = 1 - Probability of attacker being black (given witness's identification)
                                                      = 1 - 0.8
                                                      = 0.2 (or 20%)

Since we don't have enough information to directly calculate the probability of the witness being wrong, we can't provide a single, definitive answer. However, based on the given information, the most reasonable estimate would be that the attacker is black, with a probability of 0.8.
