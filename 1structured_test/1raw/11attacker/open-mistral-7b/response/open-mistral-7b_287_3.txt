To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the prior probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so we can consider P(E|H) = 0.8

2. P(H): The prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's statement. According to the information given, 15% of the city's population is black, so we can consider P(H) = 0.15

3. P(E): The prior probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the statement, regardless of the attacker's race. Given that the witness has an 80% success rate, we can consider P(E) = 0.8

4. P(H|E): The probability we are trying to find. This is the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness made the statement.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18.75%. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate based on the given information and assumptions. In real-world situations, the actual probability could be different.
