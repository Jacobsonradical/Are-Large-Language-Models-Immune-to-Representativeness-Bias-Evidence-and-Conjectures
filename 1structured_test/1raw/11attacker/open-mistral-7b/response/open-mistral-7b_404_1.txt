Given the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect, with an error rate of 20%. The witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black given that the attacker is black can be calculated as the probability of a correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black.

The probability of a correct identification is 0.8 (80%).

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identification and mistakenly identified the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white. The probability of a misidentification is 0.2 (20%).

The probability of a misidentification given that the attacker is white is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 (68%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a correct identification divided by the sum of the probabilities of a correct identification and a misidentification.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.68) = 0.15 (15%).

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 15%.
