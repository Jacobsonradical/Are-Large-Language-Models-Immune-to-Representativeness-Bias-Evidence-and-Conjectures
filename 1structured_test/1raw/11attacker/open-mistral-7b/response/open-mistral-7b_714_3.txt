To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time. However, we don't know the exact number of white and black people in the population the witness saw to make this estimate.

Let's assume that the witness saw an equal number of white and black people (since the question mentions a sample of people "half white and half black"). In this case, the witness would be correct 80% of the time if the person they saw was actually black, and they would be incorrect 20% of the time if the person was white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a randomly chosen person being black is 0.15. If we assume that the witness's identification is independent of the true race of the attacker (which might not be entirely accurate, but we'll go with it for now), then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

But the witness actually identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black plus the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black and then mistakenly assuming that the actual attacker was black.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black and then mistakenly assuming that the actual attacker was black is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.186 (18.6%).

However, this calculation assumes that the witness saw an equal number of white and black people. If the attacker was more likely to be in a certain area of the city where one race is more prevalent, then the probability would be different. Without more information, it's impossible to provide a more accurate estimate.

Therefore, strictly in the dictionary format: {probability: 0.186}
