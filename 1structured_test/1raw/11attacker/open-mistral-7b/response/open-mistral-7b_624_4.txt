To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is the probability we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80% in the information provided.
3. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This can be estimated using the information about the city's population. Since 15% of the population is black, P(A) = 0.15.
4. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of erring (i.e., incorrectly identifying a white person as black) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(B) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.97
          = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12, or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the given information and the assumptions made in applying Bayes' theorem. Real-world scenarios can be more complex and may require additional information or refinement of the assumptions.
