Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. In this particular case, the witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness's identification is correct in this instance.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we were to make an assumption that the witness's identification is a random event, independent of the city's population distribution (which might not be the case, but we're making this assumption for simplicity), then we could calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (identifying a black person as black) as the proportion of black people in the city.

However, since the witness's identification might not be a completely random event, we can't directly use the city's population distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker being black. Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate between 0 and 1. It would require additional information or assumptions to make a more definitive estimate.
