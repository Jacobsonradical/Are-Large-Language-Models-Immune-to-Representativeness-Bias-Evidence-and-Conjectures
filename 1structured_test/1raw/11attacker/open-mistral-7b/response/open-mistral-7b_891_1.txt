Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, given the demographics of the city)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time when the attacker is not black)

Since the witness's ability to judge race is the same for black and white people, we can assume that P(B|~A) = 0.2.

To find P(A|B), we need to calculate P(B) first:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.48

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
