To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker was indeed black, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black in 80% of the cases. If the attacker was white, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as black in 20% of the cases (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Let's denote P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 = 0.8 (this equation represents the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
2) 0.85 * (1 - P(black)) + 0.15 * P(black) = 1 (this equation represents the overall racial distribution of the city)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that P(black) â‰ˆ 0.15.

{probability: 0.15}

The probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes the witness's racial identification ability is independent of the actual attacker's race, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios.
