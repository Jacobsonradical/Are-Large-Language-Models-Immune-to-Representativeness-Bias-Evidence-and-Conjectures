Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is P(black) * (1 - 0.8) = P(black) * 0.2.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is P(black) / (P(black) + P(not black * witness says black)) = P(black) / (P(black) + P(white) * 0.2).

From the witness's description, we have P(black | witness says black) = 0.8. We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(black):

P(black) = P(black | witness says black) * P(witness says black | black) / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black | black) = 0.8 (given in the information)

P(witness says black) = P(black) * P(witness says black | black) + P(not black) * P(witness says black | not black)

Since 85% of the population is white, P(not black) = 0.15. The witness incorrectly identifies whites as black 20% of the time, so P(witness says black | not black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Plugging these values in, we find:

P(black) = 0.8 * 0.85 / (0.8 * 0.85 + 0.15 * 0.17) = 0.6644

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66.44%.
