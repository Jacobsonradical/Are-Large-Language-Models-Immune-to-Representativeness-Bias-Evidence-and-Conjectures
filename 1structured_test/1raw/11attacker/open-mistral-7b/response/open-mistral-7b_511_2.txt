Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy in judging race under similar conditions is only 80%.

Given these facts, the probability that the attacker is actually black is not just the 15% population rate, but rather the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker in this case.

The probability that the witness makes an error (i.e., incorrectly identifies a white person as black) is 20%. So, the probability that they correctly identify a black attacker is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, since we don't know the exact race of the attacker, we can't just multiply this probability by the 15% population rate. Instead, we should assume that there's an equal chance that the attacker is white or black, given that the witness couldn't see the attacker's race.

So, if we call P(black) the probability that the attacker is black, then P(white) = 1 - P(black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that this is indeed a black attacker is P(black) * P(correctly identifying a black attacker) + P(white) * P(mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black).

Since we don't know the exact values of P(black) and P(white), we can't solve for them directly. However, we can set up an equation:

0.80 * P(black) + (1 - P(black)) * 0.20 = 1

This equation represents the probability that the witness's identification is correct, given that the attacker is either black or white. Solving this equation would give us the probability that the attacker is black, but it's a complex task that requires advanced mathematics and more specific information.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
