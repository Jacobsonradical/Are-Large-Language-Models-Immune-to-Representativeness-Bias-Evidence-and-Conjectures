To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, we have two pieces of evidence:
1. The witness's statement, which suggests that the attacker is black (event A).
2. The demographic information about the city, which indicates that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black (event B).

Let's denote:
P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is black given the demographic information.
P(A) as the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is black.
P(B|A) as the probability that the demographic information is true given that the attacker is black.
P(B) as the probability that the demographic information is true.
P(not A|B) as the probability that the attacker is not black given the demographic information.
P(not A) as the probability that the witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is not black.

From the information provided:
P(B) = 0.85 (85% white population)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.2 (given the witness's error rate of 20%)
P(B|A) = 1
P(not A|B) = 0.15

We are given the witness's error rate, which is P(not A) = 0.2, and their ability to correctly identify race, which is P(A) = 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since P(B|A) = 1 and P(B) = 0.85, we can rewrite the equation to:

P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

P(A) = 0.8, and P(B) = 0.85.

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.941

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the demographic information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.941 or 94.1%.
