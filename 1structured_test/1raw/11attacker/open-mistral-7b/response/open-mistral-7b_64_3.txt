Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8, based on the witness's ability to judge race.
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 20% or 0.2, based on the witness's error rate.
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H) or 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.22 or 22%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, there is a 22% chance that the attacker is black.
