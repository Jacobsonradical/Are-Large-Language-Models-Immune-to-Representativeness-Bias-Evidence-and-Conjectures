Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is that the attacker is black. The prior probability of this event is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The likelihood of this evidence given that the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 80%. The likelihood of this evidence given that the attacker is white is the witness's error rate in identifying black people, which is 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the attacker being black is:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Given the information in the question, P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(witness identification | attacker is black) = 0.8
P(witness identification | attacker is white) = 0.2

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
