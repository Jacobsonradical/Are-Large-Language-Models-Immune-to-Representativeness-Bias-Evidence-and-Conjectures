To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

Given the witness's ability to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time, and the racial composition of the city being 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with probability P(W) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.03 (or 3%)
2. The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white with probability P(B) * 0.2 = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (or 3%)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up an equation based on the probabilities of errors:

0.2 = 0.03 * P(W) + 0.03 * P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.2 - 0.03 * P(W)) / 0.03

Substituting P(W) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white), we get:

P(B) = (0.2 - 0.03 * 0.85) / 0.03
        â‰ˆ 0.32

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
