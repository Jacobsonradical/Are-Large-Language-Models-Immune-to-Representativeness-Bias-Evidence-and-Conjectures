To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white).

The witness misidentified the race 20% of the time, which means the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can set up a system of equations:

1) 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = 0.2 (the witness's estimate)
2) P(black) + P(white) = 1

From equation 2, we know that P(white) = 1 - P(black). We can substitute this into equation 1:

1) 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.2

Simplifying the equation:

1) 0.8 * P(black) = 0.2

Now, we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25 or 25%

Since the witness's estimate might not perfectly represent the actual probability, this is an approximation. However, given the witness's reliability and the population demographics, the attacker is likely to be white (75%) rather than black (25%).
