Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct evidence about the racial composition of the attacker in this specific incident. The witness's statement that the attacker is black could be a correct identification or an error.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, the attacker could more likely be white, considering the majority population. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race 80% of the time suggests that the attacker could also be black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, the new evidence is the witness's statement, and the prior knowledge is the racial composition of the city.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply Bayes' theorem. We would need the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is not provided in the information. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a specific probability estimate based on the given information.

To get a more accurate estimate, you would need additional information, such as the prior probability of the attacker being black or the likelihood of the witness making a specific type of error given that the attacker is black or white.
