Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is the probability that the attacker is black in the population. We don't have this information but can use the population statistics given in the second piece of information:

P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)

The likelihood of B given A (P(B|A)) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black. This is given in the first piece of information:

P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)

The likelihood of B given not-A (P(B|not-A)) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black if the attacker is not black (white). Since the witness is less accurate in identifying white people, we can assume that P(B|not-A) is less than 0.80. However, we don't have the exact value.

The prior probability of not-A (P(not-A)) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Substituting the given values and assuming P(B|not-A) = 0.6 (since the witness is less accurate in identifying white people):

P(A|B) ≈ 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.6 * 0.85]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.12

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
