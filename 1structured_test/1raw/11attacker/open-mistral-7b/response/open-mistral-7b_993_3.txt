Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to accurately identify race is 80% under similar conditions, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could be correct (if the attacker is indeed black) or incorrect (if the attacker is white). Let's represent these two possibilities with probabilities:

1. If the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
2. If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying him as black is 0.2 (1 minus the witness's accuracy rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, one of these two scenarios must have occurred. To find the probability that the attacker is black, we need to weigh these scenarios based on their probabilities:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of correct identification | Attacker is black * Probability of attacker being black
                                                              = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                              = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. Keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and the actual probability might be different due to other unaccounted factors.
