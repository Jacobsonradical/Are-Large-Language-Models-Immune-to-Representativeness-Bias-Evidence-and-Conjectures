Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know the exact racial makeup of the group the witness was evaluating.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that the group the witness was evaluating was equally divided between whites and blacks, which is not necessarily the case in the city, as per the second piece of information.

Given this assumption, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black would be 0.8 (80%). But since we know that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification was an error would be 0.2 (20%).

Since we don't know the exact racial makeup of the group the witness was evaluating, we can't calculate the actual probability that the attacker is black based on this witness's identification. However, if we assume that the group was equally divided, then the witness's identification suggests that the attacker is likely to be black.

Therefore, without more information, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format. However, given the witness's identification and the assumption that the group was equally divided, we can say that the attacker is likely to be black, but not with certainty.
