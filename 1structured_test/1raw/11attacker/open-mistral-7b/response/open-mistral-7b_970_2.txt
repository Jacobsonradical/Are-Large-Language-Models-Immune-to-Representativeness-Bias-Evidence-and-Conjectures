Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being black (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (B).

Let's break it down:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from information "a").
2. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (from information "b").
3. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (also from information "b").
4. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is white, is assumed to be zero for simplicity (since the witness could not see the attacker's race).
5. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is white, is also assumed to be zero (for the same reason).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (event B) given that the attacker is black (event A):

P(B|A) = P(witness identifies black person as black | attacker is black) = 0.8

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (event B) given that the attacker is white (event not-A) is assumed to be zero:

P(B|not-A) = 0

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A))

Since P(B|not-A) = 0, the equation simplifies to:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Given that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.12,

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
