Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (in this case, the city's demographics) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black (given in the second piece of information: 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (also given in the second piece of information: 0.2)
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (given in the first piece of information: 0.85)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.208

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 20.8%.
