Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which can be estimated from the city's demographics: P(A) = 0.15 (15%).

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be estimated using the witness's performance: P(B) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.6
       = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
