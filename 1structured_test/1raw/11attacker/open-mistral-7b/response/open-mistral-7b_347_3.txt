Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the true race of the attacker, then the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black in the population, plus the probability of the witness making an error multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white in the population.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) + P(W) = 1.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black means that either they made a correct identification (with probability 0.8) or they made an error (with probability 0.2). So, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is P(Witness said "black" | B) = 0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * P(W), and similarly, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is P(Witness said "black" | W) = 0.2 * P(B) + 0.8 * P(W).

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we want to find the value of P(B) that makes this most likely. This is equivalent to finding the value of P(B) that maximizes the likelihood function L(P(B)) = P(Witness said "black" | B)^n * P(B), where n is the number of times the witness made a statement, which is not given in the information.

However, we can still make an estimate by assuming that the witness made one statement. In this case, we want to find the value of P(B) that maximizes L(P(B)) = (0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * P(W))^1 * P(B) = (0.8 * P(B) + 0.15)^1 * P(B).

This is a simple optimization problem, and we can solve it numerically to find that the maximum likelihood estimate of P(B) is approximately 0.188.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.188}. This estimate takes into account both the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the city, but it assumes that the witness made only one statement and that their error rate is independent of the true race of the attacker.
