The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct in this specific case.

Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of the witness being correct is the probability of drawing a black person from the population, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, the witness is not perfectly accurate and makes errors. The probability of the witness making an error in this specific case is the probability of drawing a white person from the population, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the actual probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness being correct, given that they made the identification they did. This can be calculated as the probability of drawing a black person, divided by the sum of the probability of drawing a black person and the probability of drawing a white person, given that the witness made the identification they did.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875, approximately 46.875%}
