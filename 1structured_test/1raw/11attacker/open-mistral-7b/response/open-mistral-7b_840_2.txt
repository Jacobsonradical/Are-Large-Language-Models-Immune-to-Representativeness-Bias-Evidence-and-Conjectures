Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is random and follows the city's demographic distribution (85% white and 15% black), we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (given from information b)
- P(B|A): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker = 0.8 (given from information a)
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies someone as black = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
- P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.12] = 0.666667 (approximately 66.67%)

So, given the witness's statement and the city's demographic distribution, it is estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 66.67%.
