Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's population demographics and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. City demographics: The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to occur when identifying black or white individuals.

Since we don't have sufficient information to account for the witness's error rate, we should base our estimation on the city's demographics alone. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15%, which is the proportion of the city's population that is black.

{probability: 0.15}
