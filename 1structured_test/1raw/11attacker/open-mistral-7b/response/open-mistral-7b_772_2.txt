Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information), which is 0.15
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given in the second piece of information), which is 0.8
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person (since 1 - P(B|A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person, and given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies race, and 20% of the time the witness errs, this probability is 0.2)
- P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in, which is the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

= 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.14

= 0.12 / 0.26

= 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%.
