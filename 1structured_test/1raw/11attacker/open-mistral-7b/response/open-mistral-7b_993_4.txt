Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness in identifying race.

The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black is 15% (as per the first piece of information).

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible explanations:
1) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him/her.
2) The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified him/her as black.

Given the witness's error rate, we can calculate the probability of the second scenario. If the attacker is white, the chance that the witness will erroneously identify him/her as black is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's error, is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, we know that the actual probability of a randomly chosen person being white is 0.85. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual population demographics, then the probability of the witness erring, given that the attacker is white, is still 0.20. This means that the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is the product of the probabilities of both events: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual population demographics, which is not necessarily the case. If the witness is more likely to err when identifying a minority, then the 12% probability might be an underestimate. Without further information, it is not possible to make a more precise calculation.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12, please note that this estimate is sensitive to the assumption of independent error rates}
