To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and our evidence is the witness's statement about the attacker's race. The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the city's demographics (15%). The likelihood of the witness making a correct statement given that the attacker is black is given by the witness's accuracy rate (80%).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given P(H) = 0.15 (15%), P(E|H) = 0.8 (80%), and we need to find P(H|E).

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Where:
- not H is the complementary hypothesis (attacker is white)
- P(E|not H) is the probability of the evidence given the complementary hypothesis
- P(not H) is the prior probability of the complementary hypothesis

We are given P(E|not H) = 0.2 (20%), and P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85%).

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
