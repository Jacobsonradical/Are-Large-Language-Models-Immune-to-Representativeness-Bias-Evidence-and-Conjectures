Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means this was a correct identification for them, assuming the witness was not biased or misled. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observations, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we should also consider the possibility of the witness making an error. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

So, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black was correct and not an error is 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63 (or 63%). But since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we can multiply this probability by the actual probability of the attacker being black in the population: 0.63 * 0.15 = 0.0945 (or 9.45%).

However, since the witness's identification was correct, we can directly use the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation, which is 0.8 (or 80%). Therefore, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).

In summary: {probability: 0.8}
