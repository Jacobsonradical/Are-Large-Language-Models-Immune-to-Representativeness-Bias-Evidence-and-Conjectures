Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The city's racial demographics: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make: the witness's error rate is not necessarily the probability of misidentifying a black person as white. It could also mean misidentifying a white person as black, or even both. Without more specific information, we cannot determine the exact error rate for misidentifying black people.

Therefore, based on the given information, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The best we can do is to assume that the error rate is equal for both races, which would mean the witness's accuracy does not help us in this case. In that scenario, we would still rely on the city's demographics, making the attacker likely to be white (85%) and less likely to be black (15%).

{probability: 0.15, note: This probability is an assumption based on the given information being insufficient to make a more precise estimate.}
