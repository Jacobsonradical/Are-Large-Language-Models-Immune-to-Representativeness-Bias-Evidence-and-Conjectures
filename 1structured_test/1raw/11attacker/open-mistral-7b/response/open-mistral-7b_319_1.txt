Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

The witness's incorrect identification could be due to two reasons:

a) The witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. Since the population is 85% white, this would be the more likely scenario.
b) The witness mistakenly identified a black person as white. This is less likely but still possible.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

a) Probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black:
The witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20% * 85% = 0.17 (or 17%).

b) Probability of mistakenly identifying a black person as white:
The population is 15% black. If the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, the probability of mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 20% * 15% = 0.03 (or 3%).

Now we know that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race 20% of the time, and that 17% of those errors were due to mistaking a white person for black. So, the remaining 3% of errors must be due to mistaking a black person for white.

Therefore, the attacker is more likely to be black than white, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. The probability of the attacker being black, considering the witness's error rate and the city's racial demographics, is approximately:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.18, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, the attacker is estimated to be approximately 18% more likely to be black than white, considering the given information.
