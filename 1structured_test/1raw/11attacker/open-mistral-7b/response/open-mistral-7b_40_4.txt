Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:
1. The general population demographics of the city, where 85% are white and 15% are black.
2. A witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as "p".

Given the general population demographics, we can say that p + (1 - p) = 0.15 (since 1 - p is the probability that the attacker is white). Solving for p, we get p = 0.15.

However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means that the true probability (p) is higher than our initial estimate (0.15) based on the city's demographics.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can say that p > 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.23.

To find a more precise value for p, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's incorrect identification) is equal to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the sum of the likelihood of all possible hypotheses times their prior probabilities.

Let's denote the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as "e". Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can say that e = 0.2.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black (p) is equal to the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is black (e), divided by the sum of the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is black and the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is white (1 - p):

p = e / (e + (1 - p) * (1 - e))

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8) = 0.2 / 0.72 = 0.2778

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.2778 or 27.78%.
