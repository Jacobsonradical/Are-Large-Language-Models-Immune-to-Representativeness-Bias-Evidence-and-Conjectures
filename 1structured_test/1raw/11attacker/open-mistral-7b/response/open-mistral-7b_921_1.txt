To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

Given the racial demographics of the city (85% white and 15% black), we can calculate the expected number of times the witness would correctly identify a black person in 100 trials:

Expected number of correct identifications = Total number of black people * Witness's success rate
                                                          = 15 * 0.8
                                                          = 12

However, the witness made an identification in this one situation. So, we subtract the expected number of correct identifications from 1 to account for the actual identification:

Probability that the identification is correct given the witness's reliability = 1 - Expected number of correct identifications
                                                                                                 = 1 - 12
                                                                                                 = 0.88

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is equal to this probability that the identification is correct given the witness's reliability:

{probability: 0.88}
