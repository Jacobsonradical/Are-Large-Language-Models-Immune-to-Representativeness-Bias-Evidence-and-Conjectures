Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given to be 15% by the information about the city's population.

P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observation that they did, given any attacker. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

So, using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's observation is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2
          = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. This is lower than the 15% prior probability because the witness's observation is less certain given the error rate. However, it's important to note that this is just a statistical estimate and actual events may deviate from these probabilities.
