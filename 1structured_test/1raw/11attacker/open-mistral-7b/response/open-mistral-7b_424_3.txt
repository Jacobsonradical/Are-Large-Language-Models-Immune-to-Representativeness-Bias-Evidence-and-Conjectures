Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E), where P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis H is that the attacker is black, and the evidence E is that a witness identified the attacker as black. Let's break down the components:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given to be 15% (0.15) from the city demographics.
2. P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This is given to be 80% (0.8) based on the witness's accuracy.
3. P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given to be 20% (0.2) based on the witness's error rate.
4. P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) occurring. This can be calculated as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15 = 0.8.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 80%.
