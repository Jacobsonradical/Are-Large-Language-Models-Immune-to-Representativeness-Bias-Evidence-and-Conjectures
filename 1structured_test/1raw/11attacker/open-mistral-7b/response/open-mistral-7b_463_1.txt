To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correctly identifying the race) and the error rate is 20%. To account for the possibility of error, we can subtract the error rate from the reliability to find the true probability of the attacker being black if the witness's identification is correct:

True probability = Witness's reliability - Witness's error rate
                          = 0.8 - 0.2
                          = 0.6

However, we cannot ignore the possibility that the witness made an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually white (given the witness's error) is the error rate:

Probability of attacker being white given error = Error rate
                                                                   = 0.2

Given the racial composition of the city, the probability that the attacker is white if the witness did not make an error is the inverse of the probability of the attacker being black (true probability):

Probability of attacker being white given no error = 1 - True probability
                                                                         = 1 - 0.6
                                                                         = 0.4

To find the overall probability of the attacker being black, we need to weight these probabilities by their respective likelihoods. The likelihood of the witness making an error is the error rate (0.2), and the likelihood of the witness not making an error is 1 minus the error rate (0.8).

Overall probability = Error probability * Probability given error + No error probability * Probability given no error
                               = 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.4
                               = 0.04 + 0.32
                               = 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.36 or 36%.
