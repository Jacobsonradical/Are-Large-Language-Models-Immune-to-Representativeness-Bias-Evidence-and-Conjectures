To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, with an error rate of 20%. However, the attack occurred in the dark, which might make racial identification more challenging. Without specific information about how the dark conditions affect the witness's accuracy, we can't adjust the error rate.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%.

However, the witness's identification changes this prior probability. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when they were wrong, this suggests that the witness is over-reporting the number of black people in the city when they make an error.

If we assume that the witness's error rate (20%) is representative of the true racial distribution in the city, then the attacker's actual probability of being black is higher than 15%.

To calculate a precise estimate, we would need more information. But given the information provided, we can infer that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 15%, but less than 80%.

So, the answer is: {probability: greater than 0.15, less than 0.8}
