Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, whose racial identification accuracy is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the population distribution. Since the witness is not always correct and may have mistakenly identified the attacker as black, we should adjust the 15% black population proportion according to the witness's error rate.

Let's assume the witness made a mistake in this case (i.e., the attacker is not black). In that case, the attacker must be white (given the population distribution). Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error in this case.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness correctly identified them as black. If the attacker is black, the witness will be correct 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness is correct is 0.15 (the population proportion of blacks) * 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate for blacks) = 0.12 or 12%.

Since there is a 20% chance that the witness made a mistake, and the probability that the attacker is black given a mistake is 0, the overall probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
