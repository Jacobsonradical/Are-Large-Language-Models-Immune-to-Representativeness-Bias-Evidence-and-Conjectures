To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct by multiplying the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person with the proportion of black people in the city.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%). The proportion of black people in the city is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

However, since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, this means that the true probability of the attacker being black is the complement of the probability of the witness's identification being correct.

The complement of 0.12 is 0.88 (88%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.88, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
