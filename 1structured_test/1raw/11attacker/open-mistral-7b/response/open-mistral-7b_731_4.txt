To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental principle in statistics and probability theory, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability (before the new evidence) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "attacker is black"
- π(A) as the probability of A (prior probability)
- B as the event "witness identifies attacker as black"
- π(B|A) as the probability of B given A (probability of witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- π(B|¬A) as the probability of B given ¬A (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black)

Bayes' theorem states that:
π(A|B) = π(B|A) * π(A) / (π(B|A) * π(A) + π(B|¬A) * π(¬A))

We know that π(A) = 0.15 (85% white population), π(¬A) = 0.85 (15% black population), π(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy), and π(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
π(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we find:
π(A|B) ≈ 0.2378

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.78%.
