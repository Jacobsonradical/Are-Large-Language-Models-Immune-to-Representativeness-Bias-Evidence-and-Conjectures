Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle used in statistics and probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- .~H: The attacker is not black (or white)
- E: The witness's identification

We have two pieces of prior information:
1. The proportion of black people in the city: P(H) = 0.15
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: If a person is black, P(E|H) = 0.8, and if a person is not black, P(E|.~H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|.~H) * P(.~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
