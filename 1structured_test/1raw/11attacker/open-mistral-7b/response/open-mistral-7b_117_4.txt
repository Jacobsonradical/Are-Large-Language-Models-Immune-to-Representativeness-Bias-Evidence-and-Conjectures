Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect but relatively accurate, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate.

However, we don't have information about the error rate when the witness misidentifies a white person as black. To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we would need this additional information.

Without this missing piece of information, I cannot provide a strictly numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. I recommend obtaining more data or information to make a more accurate estimate.

Therefore, {probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1}
