To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let:
- H0 be the hypothesis that the attacker is white.
- H1 be the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

According to the given information, P(H0) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white), P(H1) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(E|H0) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time), and P(E|H1) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H1|E):

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.139

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is about 13.9%.
