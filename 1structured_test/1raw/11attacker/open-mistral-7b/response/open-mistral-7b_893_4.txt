To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, we don't have enough information to directly apply this percentage to the specific situation where the witness identified the attacker as black.

We do know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. This means that the probability of a random person in the city being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, since the witness is not infallible, their testimony is likely to be influenced by this probability. It's reasonable to assume that the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black than to incorrectly identify a black person as white, given that white people make up a larger proportion of the population.

Unfortunately, without more specific information about the witness's biases or errors, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony.

So, my estimate would be that the probability that the attacker is black is likely to be higher than 0.15 (15%), but lower than the 100% that would be implied if the witness's testimony were completely reliable. However, without more data, a specific number cannot be provided with confidence.
