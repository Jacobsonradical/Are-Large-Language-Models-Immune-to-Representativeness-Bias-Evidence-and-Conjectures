Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is an 80% chance that they were correct, and a 20% chance that they were wrong.

However, we need to adjust this probability based on the racial demographics of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, if the attacker was white and the witness made an error, they would be more likely to identify the attacker as black than if the attacker was actually black.

Let's calculate this:

1. If the attacker is black, the probability is 100% * 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15
2. If the attacker is white, the probability is 100% * 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white) * 0.20 (the error rate of the witness) = 0.17
3. The total probability of the witness being correct (either because the attacker is black or because they made an error) is 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32, or 32%.
