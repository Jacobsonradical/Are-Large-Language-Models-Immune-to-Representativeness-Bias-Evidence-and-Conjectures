To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Assuming independence between the witness's racial judgment ability and the actual race of the attacker, we have:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Not Black) * P(Attacker is Not Black)]

From the provided information:
1. P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
2. P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Not Black) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
3. P(Attacker is Black) = Unknown (the question asks for an estimate)
4. P(Attacker is Not Black) = 1 - P(Attacker is Black) (by definition)

Now, we can solve for P(Attacker is Black):

P(Attacker is Black) = [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Not Black) * P(Attacker is Not Black)]

Substituting the values given:

P(Attacker is Black) = [0.8 * Unknown] / [0.8 * Unknown + 0.2 * (1 - Unknown)]

To make an estimate, we can use the population statistics provided:

P(Attacker is Black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(Attacker is Black) â‰ˆ 0.16 or 16%

So, based on the witness's identification and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 16%.
