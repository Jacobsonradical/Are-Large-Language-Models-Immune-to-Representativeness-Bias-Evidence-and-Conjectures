To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him/her.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified him/her as black.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability that the attacker is black, which we want to find. The probability of the second scenario is the probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes a mistake.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him/her as such is 0.20 (probability of being black) * 0.80 (witness's accuracy) = 0.16.

The probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him/her as black is 0.17. Since these are the only two scenarios, the total probability is the sum of these two probabilities.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.16 / (0.16 + 0.17) = 0.48, or 48%. This means that based on the witness's statement and the city's population statistics, there is a 48% chance that the attacker is black.
