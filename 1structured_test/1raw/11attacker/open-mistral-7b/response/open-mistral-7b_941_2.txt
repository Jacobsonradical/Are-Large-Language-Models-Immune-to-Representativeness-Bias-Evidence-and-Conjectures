To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (unknown but given in the population data as 15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given as 80%)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (given as 20%)
- P(B) as the probability of the witness making the identification (which is the sum of the two above probabilities)
- P(~A) as the probability of the attacker being non-black (given as 85%)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Using the given data, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%. This is a probability estimate based on the given data and assumptions, and it should be interpreted with caution.
