Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white).

We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black means that they observed an event with probability P(black). Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time, we can infer that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than 0.8, but we don't know the exact value yet.

Let's first calculate the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is black:

P(witness's statement|attacker is black) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is white:

P(witness's statement|attacker is white) = 0 (since the witness never mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(attacker is black|witness's statement) = P(witness's statement|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness's statement|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's statement|attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Substituting the given values:

P(attacker is black|witness's statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85] = 0.12 â‰ˆ 12%

However, this probability seems inconsistent with the witness's 80% accuracy rate. The discrepancy may be due to the fact that the given witness's accuracy rate is based on a different scenario than the one in this case. Since the witness was not able to see the attacker's race in this case, their accuracy rate may not be directly applicable.

Therefore, while the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement is approximately 12%, this estimate may not be reliable due to the limitations of the given information. A more accurate estimate would require additional information or a different approach to analysis.
