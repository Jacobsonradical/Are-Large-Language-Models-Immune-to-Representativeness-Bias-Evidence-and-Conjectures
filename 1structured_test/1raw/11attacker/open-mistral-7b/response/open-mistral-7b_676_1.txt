Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. The majority of the city's population is white, at 85%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the accuracy of the witness and the racial composition of the city.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker for a short time and made a decision based on their appearance. In this scenario, the attacker could potentially have features that could be misinterpreted as belonging to another race by the witness.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can calculate the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct. To do this, we can multiply the 15% probability of the attacker being black by the 80% accuracy rate of the witness:

probability = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

However, since the witness's statement was taken into account by the court, it suggests that the witness's identification was considered reliable. In this case, it might be reasonable to assign a higher probability to the witness's statement, even though it is lower than the racial composition of the city.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.12 (12%), but considering the reliability of the witness statement, a more reasonable estimate might be closer to 0.15 (15%).
