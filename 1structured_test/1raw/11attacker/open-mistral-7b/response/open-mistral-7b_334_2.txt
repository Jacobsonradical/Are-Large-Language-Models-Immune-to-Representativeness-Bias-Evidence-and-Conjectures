Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of prior information:
1. P(H): The probability that the attacker is black in the population, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. P(E|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from the information provided).
3. P(E|~H): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (from the information provided).

We are also given the total population proportion P(H) + P(~H) = 0.85 (white) + 0.15 (black) = 1.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, based on the provided information and assuming the witness's ability to judge race is representative of that night, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
