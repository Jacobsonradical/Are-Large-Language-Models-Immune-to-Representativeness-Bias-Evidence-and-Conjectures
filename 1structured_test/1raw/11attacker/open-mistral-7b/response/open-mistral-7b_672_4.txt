Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. Since the attacker's race was not actually observed, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate. Instead, we can consider the error rate.

The attacker being identified as black is an error in this context. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
