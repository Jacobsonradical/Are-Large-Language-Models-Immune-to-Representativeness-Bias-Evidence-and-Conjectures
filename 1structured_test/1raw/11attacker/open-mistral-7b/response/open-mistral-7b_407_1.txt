Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of H is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15% or 0.15. The likelihood of E given H is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8 (80%).

The likelihood of E given not H is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.164

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.735

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 73.5%.
