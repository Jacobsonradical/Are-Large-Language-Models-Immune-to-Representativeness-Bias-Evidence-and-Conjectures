To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- .~H: the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: the witness's statement (the witness identifies the attacker as black)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(.~H) = 0.85
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(E|.~H) = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|.~H) * P(.~H)]

Calculating the probabilities:
P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(E|.~H) * P(.~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.41, or 41%.
