Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15%, or 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.8 (80% success rate).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (20% success rate). The prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of A given E is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 16%.
