Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

The theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E, P(H|E), is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H), times the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(H).

In this case, the hypothesis H is that the attacker is black, and the evidence E is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability P(H) is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis P(E|H) is the reliability of the witness, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).

The probability of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

The probability of the opposite hypothesis P(~H) is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.36.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.36, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
