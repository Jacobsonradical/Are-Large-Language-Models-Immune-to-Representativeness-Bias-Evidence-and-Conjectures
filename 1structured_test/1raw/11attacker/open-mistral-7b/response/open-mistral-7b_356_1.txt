Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics that calculates the probability of an event given other events.

In this case, we have two events:
1. The event A: The attacker is black.
2. The event E: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the prior probability of event A (P(A)) and the conditional probability of event E given event A (P(E|A)). We also have the prior probability of event E (P(E)) and the conditional probability of event A given event E (P(A|E)).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)

We know the following values from the information provided:
- P(A) = probability of the attacker being black, which is given to be 15% or 0.15.
- P(E|A) = probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This value is given to be 0.8 (80%).
- P(E) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated using the probabilities of the witness being correct and incorrect for each race, weighted by their respective populations.

    P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 (probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is white)

    P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.48 or 48%

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 48%.
