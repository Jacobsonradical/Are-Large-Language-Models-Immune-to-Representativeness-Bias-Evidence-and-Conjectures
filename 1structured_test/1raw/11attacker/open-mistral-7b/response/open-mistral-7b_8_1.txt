Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (from information b, 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
    P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (the witness correctly identified a white person 80% of the time)
    P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (from information b, 85% of the population is white)

To calculate P(E|not H), we need to know the probability of a witness correctly identifying a white person. This information is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of P(E). However, we can make an approximation.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that they are incorrect when identifying a black person 20% of the time and when identifying a white person 20% of the time. This means that the witness correctly identifies a white person 80% - 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.716 of the time.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.716 * 0.85
P(E) ≈ 0.212 + 0.602
P(E) ≈ 0.814

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.814
P(H|E) ≈ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate is based on many assumptions, including the assumption that the witness's error rate for identifying white people is the same as for identifying black people. Without more information, a more precise estimate cannot be made.
