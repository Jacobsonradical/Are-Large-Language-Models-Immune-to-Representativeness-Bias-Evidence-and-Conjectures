To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it means they erred in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies the race is 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying race) = 0.12
2. The probability that the attacker is black and the witness errs in identifying the race is 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.2 (probability of witness erring) = 0.03
3. Since the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

In summary, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
