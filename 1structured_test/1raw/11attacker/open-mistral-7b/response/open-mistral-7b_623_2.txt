Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being black in the city (15% from information A).
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (0.8 from information B).
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black (0.2 from information B).
- P(~B|A) as the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker as white (1 - P(B|A) = 0.2).
- P(~B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker (1 - P(B|~A) = 0.8).

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging the values in:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.38%.
