Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2) The population makeup of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have enough information about how this witness's ability to identify race applies to the specific attacker. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race during the incident, it's unclear whether their ability to identify race accurately or erroneously applies to this situation. Therefore, based on the provided information, it's not possible to provide a probability estimate.

To estimate the probability, we would need more data or assumptions about how the witness's ability to identify race applies to this specific situation.
