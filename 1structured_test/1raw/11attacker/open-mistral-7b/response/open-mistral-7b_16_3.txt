To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness's testimony
- P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would testify to seeing a black person given that the attacker is black
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E) is the probability of the witness testifying to seeing a black person

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
2. 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Using this information, we can compute the probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
2. P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
3. P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
4. P(not H) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being white)
5. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.13

Now we can calculate the probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.13 â‰ˆ 0.62

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.62 or 62%.
