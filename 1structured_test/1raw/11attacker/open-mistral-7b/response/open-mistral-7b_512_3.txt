Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's observation is independent of the attacker's race (which is a simplifying assumption), then we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W) = 1 - P(B). According to the witness's statement, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is P(B) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as white is P(W) * 0.2.

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. Therefore, we have the equation: P(B) * 0.8 = 1.

To solve this equation, we can divide both sides by 0.8: P(B) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

However, since the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1, this means that the witness's statement is not consistent with the population demographics. It's possible that there's some error or inconsistency in the information provided.

Therefore, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. The witness's statement suggests a higher probability of the attacker being black than what we would expect based on the city's demographics, but this contradicts the requirement that probabilities must be between 0 and 1.
