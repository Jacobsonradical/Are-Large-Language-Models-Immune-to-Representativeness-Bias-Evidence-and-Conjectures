To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker is black. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness might have made an error in identifying the attacker's race.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people). The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race as black is 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying black people).

Since the actual probability that the attacker is black is what we're interested in, we should consider both scenarios:

a) If the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this happening is 0.8 (witness's accuracy).

b) If the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race, the attacker is actually white, but the witness erroneously reported him as black. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (witness's error rate).

The total probability of the attacker being black, considering both scenarios, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 (witness's accuracy) + 0 * (probability of witness's error given that the attacker is white, which is 0 because the witness cannot err if the attacker is white), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.
