To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's errors in racial identification are random, then the probability of a white person being incorrectly identified as black is equal to the probability of a black person being incorrectly identified as white. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the error rate is 20%.

So, the probability of a white person being incorrectly identified as black is 0.20 (error rate). And since there are 85% white people in the city, the number of white people is 0.85 * total population. Therefore, the number of white people incorrectly identified as black is 0.20 * 0.85 * total population.

Similarly, the probability of a black person being incorrectly identified as white is also 0.20, and there are 15% black people in the city, so the number of black people incorrectly identified as white is 0.20 * 0.15 * total population.

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, the attacker must be either a black person who was correctly identified or a white person who was incorrectly identified as black. The number of black people in the city is 0.15 * total population, so the number of black people who were correctly identified is 0.15 * total population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the number of black people who were correctly identified and the number of white people who were incorrectly identified as black:

{probability: 0.15 * total population + 0.20 * 0.85 * total population, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This expression simplifies to:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.85 + 0.20 * 0.85, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Which equals:

{probability: 0.1275 + 0.17, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Which equals:

{probability: 0.2975, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2975 or 29.75%.
