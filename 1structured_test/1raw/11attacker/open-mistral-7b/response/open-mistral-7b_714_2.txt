Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not necessarily a representative of the city's population, identified the attacker as black.
3. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the witness's error rate. Since we don't know if the witness is biased, we'll assume the witness's mistake rate is randomly distributed.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
B) The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

The probability of scenario A is the actual proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15. The probability of scenario B is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2.

However, since we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios based on the given information, we must consider both possibilities and assign a probability weighted by their probabilities.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is thus:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black and witness is correct) + P(attacker is white and witness is mistaken)

P(attacker is black and witness is correct) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
P(attacker is white and witness is mistaken) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.2 (error rate of the witness)

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = 0.15 + 0.176 = 0.326

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.326 or 32.6%.
