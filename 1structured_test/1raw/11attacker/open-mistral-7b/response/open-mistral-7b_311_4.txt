To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker's race is indeed black, the witness will correctly identify this 80% of the time. However, if the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time (given the 80% correct rate for black individuals).

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, so we can consider this as a case where the witness errs in their identification. The probability of this error happening due to misidentifying a white person as black is 0.2 (given the 80% correct rate for black individuals and 20% error rate for white individuals).

Since the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the witness erring in identifying a white person as black is 0.2, the probability of this specific error occurring is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, and this occurs when the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. The probability of this happening is 0.15 * 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies black individuals 80% of the time) = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, and this can only happen due to either the witness correctly identifying a black person as black or erring in identifying a white person as black, we can add these two probabilities to find the total probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

0.12 (correct identification of a black person as black) + 0.17 (error in identifying a white person as black) = 0.39 (or 39%)

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.39.
