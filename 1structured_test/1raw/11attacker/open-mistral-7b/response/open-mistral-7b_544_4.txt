To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have three pieces of information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (The population is 15% black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) (The probability of the evidence, which we will calculate below)

First, let's calculate P(E|not H), the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is white, P(E|not H) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.1765
P(E) = 0.2965

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2965
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.336

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.34 or 34%. This is a lower probability than the 15% black population in the city, suggesting that the witness's testimony may not be entirely reliable. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate, and there is still some uncertainty in the result.
