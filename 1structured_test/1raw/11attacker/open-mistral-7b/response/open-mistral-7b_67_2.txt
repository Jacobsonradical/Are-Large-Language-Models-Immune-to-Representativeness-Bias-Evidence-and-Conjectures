To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. Event A: The attacker is black
2. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given the posterior probability P(A|B), which is what we want to find. We also have the prior probability P(A), the likelihood P(B|A), and the prior probability of the witness making a mistake P(not A|B).

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. Prior probability P(A): The population in the city is 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15
2. Likelihood P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
3. Prior probability of mistake P(not A|B): The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(not A|B) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

So,

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 24%.
