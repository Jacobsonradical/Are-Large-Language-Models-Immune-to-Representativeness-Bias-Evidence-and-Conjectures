Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let:
- P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% from the city's demographics, or 0.15)
- P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (80% from the witness's ability, or 0.8)
- P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (20% from the witness's ability, or 0.2)
- P(~A) be the probability of the attacker being non-black (100% - P(A), or 0.85)
- P(B) be the probability of the witness identifying someone as black (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
