Based on the provided information, we have two sources of information about the attacker's race: the city's demographics and the witness's report.

1. The city's demographics suggest that 15% of the population is black. This could be our baseline probability if we had no other information.

2. However, we also have the witness's report, which identifies the attacker as black. Given that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, we can adjust our baseline probability based on this additional information.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the adjusted probability would be the product of the baseline probability and the witness's accuracy:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, probability of the attacker being black given the witness's report}

However, the witness also made errors 20% of the time. Since we don't know if this witness's error was in this case, we cannot ignore the possibility that the attacker might be white. Therefore, we should also consider the probability that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the witness making an error is 1 - the probability of the witness being correct, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

So, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's report is the product of the baseline probability and the probability of the witness making an error:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, probability of the attacker being white given the witness's report}

Given that we don't have enough information to determine which of these two probabilities is more likely, the best estimate we can give is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15, this is the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is black given both pieces of information}

So, based on the given information, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.15.
