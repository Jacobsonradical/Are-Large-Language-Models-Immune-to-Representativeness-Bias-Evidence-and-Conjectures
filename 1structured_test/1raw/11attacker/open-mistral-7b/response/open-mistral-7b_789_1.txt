Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given A, multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being black (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event B).

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15 according to the first piece of information)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker (0.8 according to the second piece of information)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black (0.2, since the witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time)
- P(not A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (0.85 according to the first piece of information)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.16

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.16 or 16%.
