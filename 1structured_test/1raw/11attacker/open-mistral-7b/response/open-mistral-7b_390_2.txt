To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- θ as the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being black in the population).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The prior probability of A is θ = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black).
2. The witness's ability to judge a person's race under similar conditions is 80% accurate for correctly identifying a black person and 20% for incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Now, we find the probability of E given A (P(E|A)) and the probability of E given not A (P(E|not A)).

P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black: 0.8.

P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the probability of not A given E (P(not A|E)) and the probability of not A (P(not A)):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(not A|E) = P(E|not A) / P(E) = 0.17 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) = 0.228

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) ≈ 0.18

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.18 or 18%.
