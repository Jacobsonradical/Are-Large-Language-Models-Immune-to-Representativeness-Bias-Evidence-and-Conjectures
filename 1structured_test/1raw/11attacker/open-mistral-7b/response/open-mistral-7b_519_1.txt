To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time and correctly identifies race 80% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white, given their past performance.

On the other hand, the city has a racial composition of 85% white and 15% black. This means that there is an 85% chance that the attacker is white and a 15% chance that the attacker is black, assuming the witness's identification is incorrect.

However, we cannot simply add these two probabilities (20% and 85%) to get our final answer, because the witness's identification is not necessarily incorrect. If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black.

Therefore, we need to multiply the probability of the witness being correct (80%) by the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness is correct (15%), and add this to the probability of the witness being incorrect (20%) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness is incorrect (85%):

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is 29%, given the information provided.
