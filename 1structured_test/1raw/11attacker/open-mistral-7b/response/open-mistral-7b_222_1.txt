Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H0: the attacker is white
- H1: the attacker is black
- E: the event where the witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information given, we have:
P(H0) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)
P(H1) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
P(E|H0) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness errs and identifies a white person as black)
P(E|H1) = 0.2 * 0 + 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = 0.16 * 0.15 / [0.2 * 0.85 + 0.16 * 0.15] = 0.0262

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 2.62%. This is a very low probability, and it is important to consider that the witness's testimony alone may not be sufficient evidence to conclude the attacker's race.
