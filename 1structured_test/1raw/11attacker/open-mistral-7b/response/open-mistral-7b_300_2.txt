To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

The racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's reliability is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time but err 20% of the time. This means that when they see a white person, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time, and when they see a black person, they mistakenly identify them as white 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness's statement could be a correct identification or an error, we need to calculate the probability of each possibility.

If the witness made an error, they mistakenly identified a white person as black. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

If the witness did not make an error, then the attacker is indeed black. Given the racial distribution and the witness's reliability, the probability of this happening is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

Since the witness's statement could be either correct or an error, we need to add the probabilities of both possibilities: 0.12 (probability of correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of error).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This means that there is a 29% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
