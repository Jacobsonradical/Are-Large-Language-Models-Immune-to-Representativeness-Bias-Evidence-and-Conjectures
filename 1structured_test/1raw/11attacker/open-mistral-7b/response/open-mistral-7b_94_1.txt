Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not always accurate in identifying race described the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

When the witness sees a person who is actually black, they correctly identify that person 80% of the time. When they see a person who is actually white, they incorrectly identify that person as black 20% of the time.

Given that we do not know if the witness was correct or incorrect in this case, we can consider both possibilities. If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed black with a probability of 0.8 (80%). If the witness was incorrect, then the attacker is actually white but was mistakenly identified as black by the witness with a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Since we do not have any other information to favor one possibility over the other, we should consider both equally likely. Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black is the average of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.17 / 2 = 0.685, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
