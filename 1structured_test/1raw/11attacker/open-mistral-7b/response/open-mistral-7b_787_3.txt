Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying the race) and 20% (erring in identifying the race).
2. The racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the possibility of the witness's error. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this means that they incorrectly label a white person as black 20% of the time they encounter a white person. Conversely, they correctly identify a black person as black 80% of the time.

Let's denote the actual probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black (when the attacker is actually white) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (85% of the population is white, and the witness errs 20% of the time).

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, the actual attacker could be either a black person or a white person misidentified as black. So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black (P(black)) and the probability of the attacker being white but misidentified as black (0.17).

So, the equation we need to solve is:
P(black) + 0.17 = 0.8

To find P(black), we can rearrange the equation:
P(black) = 0.8 - 0.17

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is 0.63 (63%).
