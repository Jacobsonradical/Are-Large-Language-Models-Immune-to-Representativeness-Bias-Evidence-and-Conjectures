To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental principle in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   P(E|not H) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying black people)
   P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker not being black)
   P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the witness's identification and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
