To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make an adjustment based on the witness's accuracy.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify it 80% of the time. Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that if the witness were to randomly select a person from the city, they would correctly identify the person's race 80% of the time if the person is black, and 80% of the time if the person is white.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. But since they are incorrect 20% of the time, there is a chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the actual attacker's race is white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.20.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. This probability is 0.80, as stated earlier.

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E (P(H|E)) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black. We know P(H) = 0.15, P(E|H) = 0.80, and we need to find P(E|H'). Here, H' is the hypothesis that the witness made an error and the attacker is white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time, P(E|H') = 0.20.

The probability of the evidence given the alternative hypothesis (P(E|H')) is used to calculate the probability of the alternative hypothesis (P(H'|E)):

P(H'|E) = P(E|H') * P(H') / P(E)

We are given P(H') = 0.85 and P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H') = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.26.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.26 = 0.3846

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3846 or 38.46%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on the given information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different in a real-world scenario.
