Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% and they err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black, but their identification is not infallible.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We can write an equation that relates P(black) to the overall racial composition and the witness's reliability:

P(black) = Probability of witness's correct identification of black attacker * Probability of attacker being black
                 = 0.8 * (P(black) / Total population proportion)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 * P(black) / 0.85)

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.952381

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.95 or 95%. Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and the assumptions made. In a real-world scenario, other factors might influence the probability.
