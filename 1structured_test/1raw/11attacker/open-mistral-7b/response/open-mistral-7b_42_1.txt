Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the attack occurred at night, we cannot directly apply the witness's ability to judge race under daylight conditions to this specific incident. Therefore, it's not possible to estimate the probability of the attacker being black with the given information.
