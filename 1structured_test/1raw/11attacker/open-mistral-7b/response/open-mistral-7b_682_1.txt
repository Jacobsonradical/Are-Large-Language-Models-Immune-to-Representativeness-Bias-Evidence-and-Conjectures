To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following information:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)

We are not given the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the race P(E | ¬H), but we can infer it from the given information. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, it means they incorrectly identify it 20% of the time.

So, P(E | ¬H) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
          = 0.0586

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 5.86%.
