Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is a probability theory describing the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E. In this case, H is the attacker being black, and E is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

From the information given, we have:
1. P(H) = Probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (given in the first piece of information)
2. P(E|H) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person = 0.8 (given in the second piece of information)
3. P(E|~H) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.2 (given in the second piece of information, where ~H means not black)
4. P(H) + P(~H) = 1, so P(~H) = 0.85 (given in the first piece of information)
5. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.252

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.252 â‰ˆ 0.316

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.316 or 31.6%.
