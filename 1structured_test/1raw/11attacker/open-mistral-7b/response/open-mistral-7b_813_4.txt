To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can model this as a binomial distribution with n=1 (since we're only interested in one observation) and p=0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying a black person).

The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as white would be 1 - p = 0.2.

However, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, not 0.2 (as suggested by the witness's error rate).

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is black. This is given by the binomial probability P(X=1|n=1, p=0.15) = 0.15.

Finally, to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's report, we can multiply this error probability by the probability of the witness reporting a black attacker, given that the attacker is actually black. This is P(witness reports black | attacker is black) = 0.8.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is P(attacker is black) = P(witness reports black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black | witness reports black) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.12}. This means there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
