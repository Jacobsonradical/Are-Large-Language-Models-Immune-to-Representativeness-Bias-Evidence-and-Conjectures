Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the demographics of the city. Let's assume that the attacker is either black or white, and the witness makes an error by misidentifying the race of the attacker.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this means that in 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race. Given that 85% of the population is white, the witness would correctly identify an attacker as white 85% of the time if the attacker is indeed white.

However, we also know that the witness errs 20% of the time, and some of these errors would result in incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black. Since there are more white people in the city, the probability of making an error in this direction (misidentifying a white attacker as black) would be higher than the probability of making an error in the opposite direction (misidentifying a black attacker as white).

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the correct identifications and the errors that result in misidentifying a white attacker as black. Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time, we can write the following equation:

P(black) + P(white) = 0.8

Since there are more white people in the city, P(white) is larger than P(black). Let's express P(white) as a function of P(black):

P(white) = 0.85 - P(black)

Now we need to consider the errors the witness makes in identifying a white attacker as black. Since there are more white people in the city, the probability of making an error in this direction is higher than the probability of making an error in the opposite direction.

Let E(white) be the probability that the witness errs and identifies a white attacker as black, and E(black) be the probability that the witness errs and identifies a black attacker as white. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can write the following equation:

E(black) + E(white) = 0.2

We know that E(black) = P(black) \* 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is black), and E(white) = P(white) \* 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is white).

Substituting P(white) = 0.85 - P(black) into the equation for E(white), we get:

E(black) + (0.85 - P(black)) \* 0.2 = 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.2 / 0.17 = 0.118

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.118 or 11.8%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the demographics of the city.
