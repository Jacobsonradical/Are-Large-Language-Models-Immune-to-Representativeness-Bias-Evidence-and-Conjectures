To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the witness misidentified a white person as black and reported it as a black attacker.

Let W be the number of white people in the city and B be the number of black people. The total population is W + B.

The probability of a random person being white is P(white) = W/(W + B) = 0.85, and the probability of a random person being black is P(black) = B/(W + B) = 0.15.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is P(witness error | white) = 0.20.

Since the witness reported a black attacker, that means either:

a) The attacker is actually black (P(black | reported black)) or
b) The witness misidentified a white person as black (P(white | reported black) * P(witness error | white))

We want to find the probability of the attacker being black, which is P(black | reported black).

P(black | reported black) = P(black and reported black) / P(reported black)

P(black and reported black) = P(black) * P(reported black | black)
P(black and reported black) = P(black) * 1

P(reported black) = P(black and reported black) + P(white and reported black)
P(reported black) = P(black) * 1 + P(white) * P(reported black | white) * P(witness error | white)

Now we can substitute the known values:

P(reported black) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * (0.85) * (0.20)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report:

P(black | reported black) = P(black) / P(reported black)
P(black | reported black) = 0.15 / (0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * (0.85) * (0.20))

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.15 / (0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * (0.85) * (0.20)), probability: 0.115}
