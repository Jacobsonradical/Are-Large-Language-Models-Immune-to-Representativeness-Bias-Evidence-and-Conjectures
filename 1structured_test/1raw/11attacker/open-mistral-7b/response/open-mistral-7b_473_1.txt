Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker is either black or white. The probability of the witness making a correct identification is the probability of the attacker being black times the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks, plus the probability of the attacker being white times the witness's accuracy in identifying whites, minus the probability of the witness making an error.

That is, P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(attacker is black) * 0.8 + P(attacker is white) * 0.2 - 0.2 * P(attacker is black)

We can solve this equation for P(attacker is black).

Let x = P(attacker is black)
Then, 0.8x + 0.2 * (1 - x) - 0.2x = the witness's identified color
0.8x - 0.2x = the witness's identified color
0.6x = the witness's identified color

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the witness's identified color is 1.

So, 0.6x = 1
x = 1 / 0.6
x = 1.6666666666666667

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can round down to 0.6, which corresponds to a 60% probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, {probability: 0.6} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
