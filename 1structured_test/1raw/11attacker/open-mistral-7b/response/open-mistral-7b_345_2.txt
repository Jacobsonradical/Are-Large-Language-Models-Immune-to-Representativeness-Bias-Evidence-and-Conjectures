Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the attacker's race (given by the population statistics) based on the evidence provided by the witness.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A (the probability that the attacker is black in the population)
- P(B) is the probability of event B (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black)

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (from information "a"). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is given as 80% (from information "b"). To find the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, we need to consider both correct and incorrect identifications. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability of being correct is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

{probability: 0.564, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, we estimate that there is a 56.4% probability that the attacker is black. It's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and does not necessarily reflect the actual identity of the attacker.
