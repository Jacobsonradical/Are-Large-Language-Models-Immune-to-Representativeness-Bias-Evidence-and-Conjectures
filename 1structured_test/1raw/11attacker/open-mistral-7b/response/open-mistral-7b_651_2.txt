Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The hypothesis here is that the attacker is black. The evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is black. We have two pieces of prior information: the demographic distribution of races in the city (85% white, 15% black), and the witness's accuracy in identifying races (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black given that the attacker is black, which is the witness's accuracy, 0.8
- P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black given that the attacker is not black, which is the witness's error rate, 0.2
- P(not B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85

We want to find P(B|W), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, which we can compute using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, given the evidence and the prior information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 32%.
