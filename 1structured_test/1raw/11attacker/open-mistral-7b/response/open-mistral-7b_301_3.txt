Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (correctly identifying black people 80% of the time).
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we do not have information about the number of people the witness observed or the specific context in which the witness made their identification. Without this information, we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Instead, we can provide an educated guess based on the witness's accuracy and the city's population composition. If we assume that the witness observed multiple people and their judgments were independent, then we might expect that the witness's observed race percentage would be close to the city's population percentage.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and considering their accuracy rate of 80%, we might expect that the actual proportion of black attackers is higher than 15%. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to provide a precise probability.
