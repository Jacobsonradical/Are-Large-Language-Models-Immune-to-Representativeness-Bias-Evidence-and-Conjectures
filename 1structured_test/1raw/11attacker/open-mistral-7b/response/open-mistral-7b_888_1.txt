Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, and it provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: H1: The attacker is black, and H2: The attacker is white. We have two pieces of evidence: E1: The population demographics, and E2: The witness's identification.

The probability of each hypothesis before considering any evidence is known as the prior probability. Given the population demographics, we can calculate the prior probabilities as follows:

P(H1) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black)
P(H2) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is white)

The likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence is calculated as follows:

P(E1|H1) = 1 (since the attacker being black is consistent with the population demographics)
P(E1|H2) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is white given the population demographics)

The witness's ability to identify the race is given by P(E2|H1) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time) and P(E2|H2) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the attacker's race based on the witness's identification:

P(H1|E1 and E2) = [P(E2|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E2|H1) * P(H1) + P(E2|H2) * P(H2)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E1 and E2) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H1|E1 and E2) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24%.
