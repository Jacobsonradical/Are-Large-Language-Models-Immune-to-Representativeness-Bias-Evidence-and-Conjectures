To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make an adjustment for the potential bias of the witness.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black (as per information b), and the witness identifies this correctly 80% of the time.

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies whites as black 20% of the time. Since there is a 85% chance that the attacker is white (as per information b), and the witness errs 20% of the time, there is a 17% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

So, the total probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (either correctly or incorrectly) is 80% (correct) + 17% (incorrectly).

The probability that the witness is actually identifying a black person is 80% (correct) / (80% + 17%) = 0.80 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.82.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions, including the witness's ability to judge race under similar conditions, the accuracy of the provided population statistics, and the assumption that the witness's error rate is consistent for both black and white individuals. In reality, these factors may not hold perfectly, and the actual probability could be different.
