To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our belief about the attacker's race given the new evidence from the witness. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the witness's evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = Unknown (we need to estimate this probabilty)
- P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.23 (the probability that a random person is mistakenly identified as black by the witness)

Since we don't have the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)), we can't calculate the exact probability. However, we can use the witness's racial bias (which is reflected in their error rate) to estimate the prior probability.

The witness is biased towards identifying white people, as they only correctly identify black people 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. Given this bias, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being black is lower than 0.15 (since the population is 85% white and 15% black).

However, without more information or data, it's impossible to provide a precise number for P(A). Therefore, the answer in the requested dictionary format would be:

{probability: Unknown, please provide more information or data}
