Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- E as the event that the attacker is black according to the witness

The probability of the witness being correct (P(E|A)) is given as 0.8 (80%). The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given as 0.15 (15%). The probability of the witness being incorrect (P(E|not A)) is given as 0.2 (20%). The prior probability of the attacker not being black (P(not A)) is given as 0.85 (85%).

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.26

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 26%.
