Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, times the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification. The prior probability of event A (the attacker being black) is not provided, but we can infer it from the city's demographics given in event b.

So, let's break it down:

1. Prior probability of A (P(A)) = 15% (from event b)
2. Witness's accuracy in identifying race (P(B|A)) = 0.8
3. Witness's error rate in identifying race (P(not B|A)) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2
4. Proportion of whites in the population (P(not A)) = 0.85 (from event b)
5. Probability of witness identifying a black person as black, given they are actually white (P(B|not A)) = P(B|A) * P(not A) / P(A) = 0.12
6. Probability of witness identifying a black person as not black, given they are actually black (P(not B|A)) = 1 - P(B|A) * P(not A) / P(A) = 0.68

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of A given B (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.12 * 0.85] = 0.118

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 11.8%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability may be different in reality.
