To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

From the provided information, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, the witness's identification is not always accurate. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as p. The witness's identification of the attacker as black would be correct if the attacker is indeed black (p), and it would be an error if the attacker is white (1-p).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that this identification is correct is the product of the true probability of the attacker being black and the witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person. This can be written as:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = p * 0.8

On the other hand, the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect is the product of the true probability of the attacker being white and the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a white person. This can be written as:

P(attacker is white | witness's identification) = (1-p) * 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability of this event should be 1. Therefore, we have:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) + P(attacker is white | witness's identification) = 1

Substituting the expressions for the probabilities, we get:

p * 0.8 + (1-p) * 0.2 = 1

Now, we can solve for p:

0.8p + 0.2(1-p) = 1
0.8p + 0.2 - 0.2p = 1
0.6p = 1
p = 1/0.6
p = 1.67

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it appears that the witness's identification is not consistent with the racial distribution in the city. This might indicate that the witness's identification is not reliable enough to draw a conclusion about the attacker's race based on the provided information.

Therefore, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, but the information suggests that the witness's identification may not be reliable.
