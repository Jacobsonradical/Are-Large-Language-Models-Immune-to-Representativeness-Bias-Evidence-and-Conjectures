Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the demographics of the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement and demographics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's ability to correctly identify race)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race is 0.8, and the probability of the witness erring is 0.2.

2. P(H): The demographics of the city tell us that 15% of the population is black. So P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the witness making the statement and the demographics of the city being as they are, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white. Since the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can calculate this as the weighted average of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H means the attacker is not black.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of them identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black is 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16. So P(E|~H) = 0.84.

Therefore, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.84 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.70 = 0.82.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.82 â‰ˆ 0.1215

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12.15%. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions and simplifications, and in a real-world situation, the actual probability could be different. It's also important to note that this estimate only takes into account the witness statement and the demographics, and other evidence should be considered in a real investigation.
