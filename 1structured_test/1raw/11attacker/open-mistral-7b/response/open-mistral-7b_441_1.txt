Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 20% or 0.2, and since 85% of the population is white, P(~H) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this expression gives P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.282

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 28.2%.
