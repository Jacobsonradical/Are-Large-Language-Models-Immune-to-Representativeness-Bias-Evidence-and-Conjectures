To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the occurrence of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- ∼H: The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (P(E|H)) is given as 0.8 in the information, and the probability of the witness making an error (P(E|∼H)) is given as 0.2.

The prior probabilities of the attacker being black (P(H)) and not black (P(∼H)) are given as 0.15 and 0.85, respectively, in the information.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|∼H) * P(∼H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating, we find:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.3982

Hence, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3982, or 39.82%.
