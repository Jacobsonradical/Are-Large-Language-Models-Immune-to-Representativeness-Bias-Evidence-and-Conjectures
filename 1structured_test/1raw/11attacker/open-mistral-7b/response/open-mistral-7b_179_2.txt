Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have information about a witness who identified the attacker as black but has a 20% error rate in identifying races. The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black, due to the error rate. Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, and the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (from the information about the witness's accuracy). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (from the information about the witness's error rate).

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the total probability of the witness identifying a black person (either correctly or incorrectly) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.12 (12%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
