Based on the information provided, we cannot make a definitive probability estimate as the attacker's race was not directly observed by the victim. However, we do have the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial distribution of the city population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's statement is a misidentification (an error), then the probability that the attacker is actually white would be the percentage of whites in the city, which is 85%.

On the other hand, if we assume that the witness's statement is correct, then the probability that the attacker is black would be 15%, which is the percentage of blacks in the city.

Given this information, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black or white, but we can provide two probability estimates:
1. If the witness's statement is an error, then the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.15 (15%).
2. If the witness's statement is correct, then the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.80 (80%).

As we cannot definitively say whether the witness's statement is an error or not, it is not appropriate to provide a single probability estimate. Therefore, strictly in the requested dictionary format, the answer would be: {probability: Unable to provide a definitive probability estimate}
