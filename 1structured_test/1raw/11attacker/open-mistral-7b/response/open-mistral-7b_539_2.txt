Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually white, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time, and vice versa.

If we assume that the witness saw a random person from the city, the probability of that person being white is 0.85 (85%) and the probability of them being black is 0.15 (15%).

The witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was actually white, the probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.20 (20%), as we mentioned earlier.

Since the witness did not make this mistake, it means that the attacker must be black or the witness correctly identified them as such. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.80 (80%), as we also mentioned earlier.

Given that the attacker is black or the witness correctly identified a black person, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.23}

Therefore, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23%.
