Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is stated as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This error occurs 20% of the time, according to the given information.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

Since the witness made an error in this case, it's reasonable to assume that the error was made in identifying the attacker as black. In other words, the actual probability of the attacker being black is less than the 15% population rate.

The probability of the witness making an error in identifying the attacker's race while the attacker is black is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's error, is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80%.

However, we know that the actual population ratio is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness's error is likely to overestimate the number of black attackers, we can adjust the estimate based on the true population ratio.

Let's assume that the witness's error increases the number of black attackers by a factor of 1.25 (from 0.15 to 0.15 * 1.25 = 0.19). In this case, the actual number of black attackers is 0.19 * 0.80 = 0.152 or 15.2%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.152 or 15.2%, which is lower than the 15% population rate due to the witness's error.
