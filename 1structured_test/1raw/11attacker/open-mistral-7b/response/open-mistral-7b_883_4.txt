Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The reliability of the witness in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an additional piece of information that might be relevant but is not explicitly stated: the reliability of the witness's identification on the night of the attack. Since we don't have this information, we'll assume that the witness's performance on that night was similar to their average performance (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

Given this assumption, the witness's identification of the attacker as black has a 80% probability of being correct, and a 20% probability of being incorrect.

Now, let's consider the possibility of an incorrect identification. If the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, it means that the actual attacker was white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of this happening is 0.85.

But remember, we're assuming that the witness's performance on that night was similar to their average performance. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20% error rate).

So, the probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

If the witness did make this mistake, then the actual attacker is indeed white, and our initial assumption about the attacker's race being black would be incorrect.

Therefore, the total probability of the witness's identification being incorrect (regardless of whether it's due to the witness's error or the attacker actually being white) is 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37 or 37%.

Since we've assumed that the witness's performance on that night was similar to their average performance, and we don't have any reason to believe otherwise, we can conclude that the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct in their identification, which is 0.8 or 80%.

So, {probability: 0.8} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.
