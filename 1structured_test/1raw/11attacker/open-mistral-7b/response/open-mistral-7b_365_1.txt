Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are black (this is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (this is the proportion of blacks in the population, which is 0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification (this is the sum of the probability of their identification being correct and the probability of their identification being incorrect, which is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.75

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
