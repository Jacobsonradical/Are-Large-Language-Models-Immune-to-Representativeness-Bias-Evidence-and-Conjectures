Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is usually written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B, which we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A, which is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A, which is the probability of the attacker being black before any evidence. This is given as 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black).
- P(B) is the probability of event B, which is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black. This can be calculated using the witness's overall accuracy: P(B) = P(B|Black) * P(Black) + P(B|White) * P(White) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
