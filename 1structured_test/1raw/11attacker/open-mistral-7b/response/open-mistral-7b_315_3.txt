To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W) = 1 - P(B).

The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time. This gives us the following conditional probabilities:

P(W|B identified as black) = 0.2
P(B|B identified as black) = 0.8

The witness identifies the attacker as black. So, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

P(B|attacker identified as black) = P(B and attacker identified as black) / P(attacker identified as black)

We can write the numerator as:

P(B and attacker identified as black) = P(B) * P(attacker identified as black | B)

And the denominator as:

P(attacker identified as black) = P(B and attacker identified as black) + P(W and attacker identified as black)

Using the given information, we can calculate P(B and attacker identified as black) and P(W and attacker identified as black):

P(B and attacker identified as black) = P(B) * P(attacker identified as black | B)
                                                        = P(B) * 0.8

P(W and attacker identified as black) = P(W) * P(attacker identified as black | W)
                                                        = P(W) * 0.2

Since the total population is 85% white and 15% black, we have P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(attacker identified as black):

P(attacker identified as black) = P(B and attacker identified as black) + P(W and attacker identified as black)
                                                    = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
                                                    = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                    = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|attacker identified as black):

P(B|attacker identified as black) = P(B and attacker identified as black) / P(attacker identified as black)
                                                      = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.29
                                                      â‰ˆ 0.483

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.483 or 48.3%.
