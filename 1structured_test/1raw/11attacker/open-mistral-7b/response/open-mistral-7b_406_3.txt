To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there is an 80% chance that they are correct, and a 20% chance that they are wrong.

However, we need to account for the fact that the majority of the city's population is white. If the witness is making a false positive identification (identifying a white person as black), it is more likely to happen in the majority white population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness making a false positive identification (WP) is the probability of selecting a white person times the probability of the witness misidentifying that person as black. This can be represented as:

WP = P(white) * 0.2

The probability of the witness making a true positive identification (TP) is the probability of selecting a black person times the probability of the witness correctly identifying that person as black. This can be represented as:

TP = P(black) * 0.8

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the sum of TP and WP must equal 1:

P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 = 1

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, this sum is less than 1. This means that there is an inconsistency in the information provided. It is not possible for the witness to have identified the attacker as black with 80% accuracy if 85% of the population is white and the majority of false positives would come from the white population.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to provide a valid estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. It is recommended to reevaluate the reliability of the witness's racial identification or to obtain more information about the racial composition of the population in the area where the attack occurred.
