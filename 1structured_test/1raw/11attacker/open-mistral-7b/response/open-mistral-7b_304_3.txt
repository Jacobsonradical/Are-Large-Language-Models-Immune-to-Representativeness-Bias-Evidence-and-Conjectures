Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who is not perfect but has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory used for conditional probabilities. It allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In our case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (the event we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are indeed black (witness's accuracy rate)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are not black (witness's error rate)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (the complementary event)

Since we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, we can calculate P(B|A) and P(B|~A):
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (1 - 0.8)

We also know the population distribution, so P(A) = 0.15 (15%), and P(~A) = 0.85 (85%).

Now we can calculate the probability of the event (the attacker being black) given the new evidence (the witness's identification):

P(A|B) = [P(A) \* P(B|A)] / [P(A) \* P(B|A) + P(~A) \* P(B|~A)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2)] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's accuracy and error rates are constant across all races and lighting conditions. In reality, this might not be the case, and the witness's identification could be influenced by other factors. This should be considered when interpreting the result.
