Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we should consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(A). We know that the probability of the witness making a mistake is 20%, which means the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.

Since the city is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Given the witness's reliability, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, we also know that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black, P(A), must be greater than the probability of the witness making a mistake with a white attacker. Therefore, we can write an inequality:

P(A) > 0.17

But we don't have enough information to calculate a specific value for P(A). Therefore, the strict answer to the question would be:

{probability: Unable to provide a specific number between 0 and 1 due to insufficient information}
