Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The attacker's race was not directly observed by the victim.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

The key question here is: Given that the witness made a mistake, what is the probability that the mistake was identifying a white person as black, rather than the other way around?

Let's denote the true race of the attacker as R (either white or black). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying R as the opposite race is equal to the error rate of the witness, which is 20%.

However, since the city has a racial demographic of 85% white and 15% black, it's more likely that a white person is mistakenly identified as black than a black person is mistakenly identified as white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's mistaken identification, is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white, multiplied by the proportion of black people in the city, plus the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, multiplied by the proportion of white people in the city.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 20%. The proportion of black people in the city is 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. The proportion of white people in the city is 0.85.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's mistaken identification, is:

0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71

Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.71 (or 71%).
