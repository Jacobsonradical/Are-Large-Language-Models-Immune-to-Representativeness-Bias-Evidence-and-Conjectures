Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that they were correct. However, we need to account for the actual racial distribution in the city, as the witness's accuracy rate is not perfect.

The attacker being white accounts for 15% of the population, and the witness incorrectly identifies blacks as white 20% of the time. So, there's a 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 probability (or 3%) that the witness mistakenly identified a white attacker as black.

Adding these two probabilities together gives us the final estimate:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83, or 83%}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 83%.
