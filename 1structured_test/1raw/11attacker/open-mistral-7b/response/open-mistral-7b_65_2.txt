To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, they misidentified the attacker as black. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, it's more likely that the attacker is white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W). We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we can set up an equation as follows:

P(W) * 0.20 = P(B) * 0.80

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (P(W) * 0.20) / 0.80 = 0.25 * P(W)

Since P(B) + P(W) = 1, we can write another equation:

P(B) = 1 - P(W)

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

0.25 * P(W) = 1 - P(W)

Solving for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.4

Substituting P(W) back into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.25 * 0.4 = 0.10

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.10 or 10%. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate based on the given information and assumes the witness's ability to judge race remains constant in all conditions. In a real-world scenario, other factors may influence the probability.
