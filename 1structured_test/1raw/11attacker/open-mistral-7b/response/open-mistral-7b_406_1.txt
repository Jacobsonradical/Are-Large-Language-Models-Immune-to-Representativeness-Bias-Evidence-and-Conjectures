Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have any information about whether the witness was more likely to make errors when identifying white or black individuals.

Given that we cannot make this assumption, the best estimate would be to use the raw error rate of 20%. This means that for every 100 people the witness identifies, they will err 20 times. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and we assume that the error rate is constant, the probability that the actual attacker is black is 1 - the error rate, which equals 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.

However, considering the witness's higher accuracy rate in identifying black individuals (80% vs. 50% for whites if the error rate is constant), it might be reasonable to assume a higher probability of the attacker being black. But without more specific information, a strict estimate based on the given data would still be 0.8.
