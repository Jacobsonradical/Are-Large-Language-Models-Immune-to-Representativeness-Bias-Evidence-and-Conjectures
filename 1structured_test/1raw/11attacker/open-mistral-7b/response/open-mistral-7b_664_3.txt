To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as identifying race correctly 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.
2. To find the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, we can multiply the probability of the attacker being white by the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black. This is: 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.20 (probability of witness error) = 0.17 (probability of witness error given attacker is white).
3. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is then 1 - 0.17, which is 0.83.
4. To find the probability that the attacker is black, we need to multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person by the probability that the attacker is black. This is: 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.80 (probability of witness correct identification given attacker is black) = 0.12 (probability of both events happening).
5. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black and the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
