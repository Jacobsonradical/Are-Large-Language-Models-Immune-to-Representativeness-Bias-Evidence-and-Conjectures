Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can only consider the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, it means that either the attacker is actually black (with a probability of 1 - 0.17 = 0.83, or 83%) or the witness made a mistake (with a probability of 0.17, or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
