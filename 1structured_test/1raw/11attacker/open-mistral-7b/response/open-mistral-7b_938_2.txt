To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker is black
- ¬A: The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: The witness's description matches a black person

According to the provided information, the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is unknown. However, we know the prior probability of the attacker being white (P(¬A)) since we know the racial distribution in the city. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% white population).

We are also given the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as being black (P(E|A)) and the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as being black (P(E|¬A)). From the information provided, P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(E|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness's description matches a black person:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

To find an estimate for P(A|E), we would need to know the value of P(A). Without this information, we cannot provide an exact number, but we can still provide an approximate value.

Since P(A) and P(¬A) must sum to 1, and we know P(¬A) = 0.85, we can infer that P(A) ≈ 0.15.

Substituting this approximate value into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.12 (12%)

However, this estimate should be considered an approximation due to the lack of precise values for some variables.
