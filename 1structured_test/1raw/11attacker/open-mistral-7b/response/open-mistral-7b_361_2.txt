Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

The theorem is written as P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification and population statistics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probabilities used in the formula:

1. P(H) (prior probability of the attacker being black) = 15% (from information b) = 0.15
2. P(E|H) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as black given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (from information a)
3. P(E|~H) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (assuming the error rate for identifying whites is the same as for blacks, and given that 85% of the population is white)
4. P(E) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.229

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.229 â‰ˆ 0.417

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.417 or 41.7%.
