Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% when the person is black and 20% when the person is white.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given the witness's statement, we can assume that they saw the attacker as black. However, we need to consider the possibility of the witness making an error. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when they see a white person, we cannot directly assume that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement without considering this error rate.

Since we don't have any information about the attacker's actual race, we can't directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black from the attack itself. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the attacker being black),
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B (the witness saying the attacker is black),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is actually black),
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness says the attacker is black).

We have the following values:
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
- P(B|A) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time).
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1-P(A))

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, P(not A) = 0.15. P(B|not A) is given as 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time when the attacker is white).

We can rewrite P(B) as:
P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.03

Now we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = (P(B) - 0.03) / 0.8

Substituting the value of P(B) from the information given:

P(A) = (0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 - 0.03) / 0.8
P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.8 = P(A)

This equation has no solution, as it states that the probability of the attacker being black is equal to itself. This indicates that we have not enough information to directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement alone.

However, we can use the population statistics to make an educated guess. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, it is more likely that the attacker is white. Therefore, our estimate should be closer to 0.85 than 0.15.

However, we need to consider the witness's statement that they identified the attacker as black. Given this statement, it is also plausible that the attacker is black. Since the witness is not infallible, it is possible that they made an error and the attacker is actually white. However, given the low error rate of the witness, this is less likely.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, would be closer to 0.15 (the true probability of the attacker being black in the population) than 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white in the population), but still not equal to either.

Therefore, {probability: 0.15 + some small positive value, but not a specific number} is an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. This estimate takes into account both the population statistics and the witness's statement, but acknowledges that we do not have enough information to make a precise calculation.
