Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence E is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the event times the prior probability of the event.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence E is the witness's statement that the attacker is black. The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of the population that is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker being black is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8. The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker being white is the error rate, which is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:
- P(A|E) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement
- P(E|A) is the probability of the witness's statement given the attacker being black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|~A) is the probability of the witness's statement given the attacker being white
- P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
        = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.177)
        â‰ˆ 0.40

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.40 or 40%.
