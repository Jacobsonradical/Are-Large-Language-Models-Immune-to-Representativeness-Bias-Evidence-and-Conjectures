Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfect at identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. The witness was correct 80% of the time and made errors 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the prior probability of the attacker being black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the witness makes a correct identification as P(C|B) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually black).

The probability that the witness makes an error is P(C|\text{not-B}) = 0.2 (the witness is correct 20% of the time when the person is not black).

The prior probability of the attacker being white is P(not-B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white).

The likelihood ratio is LR = P(C|B) / P(C|not-B) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as:

P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / [P(C|B) * P(B) + P(C|not-B) * P(not-B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|C) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)] = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 24%.
