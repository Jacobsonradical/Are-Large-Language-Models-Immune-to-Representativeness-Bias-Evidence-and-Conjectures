Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The attacker's race was not directly observed by the victim.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as black with a probability of 80% when given a half-half sample of white and black people.
3. The witness was incorrect 20% of the time.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can assume that there's an equal probability of the attacker being either white or black, given the city's demographics (85% white and 15% black).

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that their identification of the attacker as black is also incorrect 20% of the time, meaning they would mistakenly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time, we can infer that the attacker was actually black 80% of the time when the witness correctly identified them as such.

However, since the witness is also incorrect 20% of the time, we need to account for the possibility that they mistakenly identified a white person as black and reported it as a black attacker. This would artificially inflate the proportion of black attackers.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black and reporting it as a black attacker. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, they would mistakenly identify a white person as black 20% of the time when given a half-half sample.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black and reporting it as a black attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, to estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony, we can subtract the probability of the witness's mistaken identification from the overall proportion of black people in the city:

0.8 (proportion of correct black identifications) * 0.15 (actual proportion of black people) + 0.17 (probability of mistaken identification) = 0.218 or 21.8%

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information, and in real-world scenarios, the situation might be more complex and require further investigation.
