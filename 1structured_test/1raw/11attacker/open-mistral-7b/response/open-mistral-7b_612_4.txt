Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the information, we know two things:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, given in piece b)
2. P(E|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given in piece a)
3. P(E|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is not black)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, given in piece b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find:

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 28.57%.
