To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker is black.
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black.
- W: The witness's ability to judge race.

We are given the prior probability of A (P(A)), which is not provided but we can infer it from the population statistics given in point b. Since 15% of the population is black, we can assume P(A) = 0.15.

We also know the conditional probability of E given A (P(E|A)), which is given in point a as 0.8. This means that, given that the attacker is black, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time.

Similarly, we know the conditional probability of E given the complement of A (P(E|A^c)). Since the witness errs 20% of the time when judging race, we can assume P(E|A^c) = 0.2.

Finally, we know the prior probability of W (P(W)), which is not provided but can be assumed to be 1 since it is a certain event.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|A^c) * P(A^c)]

Given the values we have, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

We can calculate the probabilities and find:

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, based on the given information, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.25 (25%).
