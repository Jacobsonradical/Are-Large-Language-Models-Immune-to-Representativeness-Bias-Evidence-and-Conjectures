Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying races, identified the attacker as black.

The witness's error rate is 20%, so when they say a person is white, they are actually referring to a black person 20% of the time.

However, in this case, the witness said the attacker was black. Since we don't know if the witness is biased or not, we can't make assumptions about their errors when they identify a black person as white.

Therefore, the most reasonable estimate is based on the population distribution in the city, which is 15% black.
