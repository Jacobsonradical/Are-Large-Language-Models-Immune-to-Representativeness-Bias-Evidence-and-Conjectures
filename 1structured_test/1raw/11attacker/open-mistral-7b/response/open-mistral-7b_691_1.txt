Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to make an estimate:
1. The racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black)
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race (80% correct, 20% error)

However, there's a discrepancy between the witness's identification and the actual racial composition of the city. The witness identified the attacker as black, but the city's population is predominantly white. This discrepancy might indicate that the witness's identification is not a reliable indicator of the attacker's race, especially considering the low light conditions at night.

Given this, it would be reasonable to use the city's racial composition as a more reliable estimate. So, our estimate would be:
{probability: 0.15, the attacker is black, given that the city's population is 15% black}
