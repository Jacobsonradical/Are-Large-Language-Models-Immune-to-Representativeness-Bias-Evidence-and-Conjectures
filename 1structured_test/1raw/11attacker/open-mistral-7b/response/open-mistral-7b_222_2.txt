To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. This means that when the witness actually sees a black person, there is an 80% chance they will correctly identify that person as black.

However, we don't know for certain that the witness saw a black person. If the attacker was white, there is a 15% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness saw a black person and correctly identified them, plus the probability that the witness saw a white person and incorrectly identified them as black.

The probability that the witness saw a black person and correctly identified them is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city) times 0.8 (the reliability of the witness in correctly identifying black people), which equals 0.12 or 12%.

The probability that the witness saw a white person and incorrectly identified them as black is 85% (the proportion of white people in the city) times 0.2 (the reliability of the witness in incorrectly identifying white people), which equals 0.17 or 17%.

Adding these two probabilities gives us an estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's reliability in identifying race is the same in the dark as it is in daylight. If it is lower, the probability that the attacker is black would be lower.

Therefore, {probability: 0.29, caveat: this estimate assumes that the witness's reliability in identifying race is the same in the dark as it is in daylight}
