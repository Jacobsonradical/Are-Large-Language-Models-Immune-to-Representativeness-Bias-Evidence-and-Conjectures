Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of a correct identification given the attacker's race.

In this case, the attacker's race is unknown, but based on the city's demographics, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is the same as the probability of drawing a black person from the population (given that the witness correctly identifies that person's race).

So, the probability of a correct identification of a black attacker is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city). The probability of an error (identifying a white person as black) is 15% * 0.20 (the probability of drawing a white person from the population times the witness's error rate in identifying whites as black).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 15% - 15% * 0.20 = 0.85 - 0.03 = 0.82 or 82%.

So, {probability: 0.82}
