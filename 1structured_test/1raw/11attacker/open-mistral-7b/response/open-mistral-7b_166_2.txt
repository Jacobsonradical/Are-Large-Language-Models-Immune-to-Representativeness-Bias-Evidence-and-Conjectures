Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This is our prior probability, based on demographic data.
2. A witness, who is not perfect but has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that enables us to update our belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H = the attacker is black
E = the witness identified the attacker as black

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
2. P(E | H) = 1 (the witness was correct in this case, so the probability is 1)
3. P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.1765 = 0.3265
4. P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.3265 ≈ 0.4626

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence and the demographic data, is approximately 0.46 or 46%. This means that, based on the given information, we would expect the attacker to be black about 46% of the time. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and that actual events may differ from these probabilities.
