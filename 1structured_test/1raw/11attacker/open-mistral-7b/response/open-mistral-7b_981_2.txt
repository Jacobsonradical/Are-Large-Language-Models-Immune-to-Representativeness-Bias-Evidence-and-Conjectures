To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct (the attacker is black) and the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect (the attacker is white).

If the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race is 0.8 (80%).
If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the race is 0.2 (20%).

The probability of the witness's identification being correct (attacker is black) is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).
The probability of the witness's identification being incorrect (attacker is white) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness has identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability of this being a correct identification. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (12%).
