Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)
  P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was white)
  P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.619

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.619 or 61.9%.
