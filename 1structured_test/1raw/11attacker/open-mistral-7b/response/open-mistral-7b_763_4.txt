Given the information provided, we have a witness who is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have all the necessary components to calculate P(H|E), but we need to know the value of P(E). P(E) is the probability of the witness making the identification, either correctly or incorrectly. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, and correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the overall probability of making an identification is 100% = 80% (correct) + 20% (incorrect).

Now, we can calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this is equal to 0.8.

Next, we have P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 15% in the information provided.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [1]
= 0.12

So, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
