Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black in the city population) is given as 15%.

The conditional probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) is given as 0.8 (80%).

The conditional probability of B given not A (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black) is given as 0.2 (20%).

The likelihood ratio (LR) is the ratio of the conditional probabilities, which is LR = P(B|A) / P(B|not A) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the given values, we get: P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 or approximately 41.38%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.38%.
