Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E, P(H|E), can be calculated as the product of the prior probability of H, P(H), and the likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), divided by the probability of E, P(E).

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black. The prior probability of H, P(H), is the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15%. The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 80%.

The probability of E, P(E), is the sum of the probability of E given that H is true, P(E|H), times the prior probability of H, P(H), and the probability of E given that H is false, P(E|~H), times the prior probability of ~H, P(~H). Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, P(E|~H) is 0.20. The prior probability of ~H, P(~H), is the complement of P(H), which is 0.85.

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.16 = 0.46875

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.46875, or 46.875%.
