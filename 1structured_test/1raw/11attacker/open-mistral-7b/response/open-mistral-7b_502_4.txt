To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

First, let's define our variables:
- H: the attacker is black
- ~$H$: the attacker is not black (or white)
- E: the witness identified the attacker as black

Now, we have the following probabilities:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(~$H): the prior probability of the attacker being not black
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is black
- P(E|~$H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is not black

From the information given, we know that P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~$H) = 0.2. We also know that P(H) + P($~H$) = 1, and from the city's demographics, we can estimate P($~H$) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~$H) * P($~H$)]

Substituting our known values, we get:

P(H|E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) ≈ 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.17

P(H|E) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) ≈ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
