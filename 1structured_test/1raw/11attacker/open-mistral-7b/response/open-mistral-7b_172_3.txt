To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (from the statistics about the city's population)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy rate when identifying black people)
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate when identifying white people as black)

Now we need to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the values inside the parentheses:

P(B|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

Simplifying the fraction:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate is that there is a 41% probability that the attacker is black.
