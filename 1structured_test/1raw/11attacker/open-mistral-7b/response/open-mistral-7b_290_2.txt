Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this is an error in their estimation. Therefore, the probability that the actual attacker is not black is 20%. However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, so we can calculate it as 1 minus the probability that they are not black:

{probability: 0.8}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
