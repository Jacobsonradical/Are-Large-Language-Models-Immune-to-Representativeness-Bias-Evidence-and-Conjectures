Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

2. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% in the city's population.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, regardless of whether they are actually black or not. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.5 (since there is an equal chance of encountering a black or white person).

4. P(H|E) is what we're trying to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
