To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the distribution of races in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so we can assume that when the witness identifies a person as black, there is a 20% chance that the person is actually white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given a witness identification is:

Probability (Attacker is black | Witness says black) = Probability of witness being correct / (Probability of witness being correct + Probability of witness being wrong)
                                                                  = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
                                                                  = 0.8 / 1.0
                                                                  = 0.8

However, since we don't know if the witness is correct in this case, we need to consider the distribution of races in the city. The city is 85% white and 15% black. If the witness's identification is independent of the attacker's race, the probability that the attacker is black is simply the proportion of black people in the city:

Probability (Attacker is black) = Probability of attacker being black given witness identification * Probability of witness identification being correct + Probability of attacker being black given witness misidentification * Probability of witness misidentification
                                             = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0 * 0.2
                                             = 0.64

But since we don't know if the witness's identification is correct, we can only use the witness's identification as additional evidence, not as definitive proof. Therefore, a conservative estimate would be to use the raw probability of the attacker being black, which is still 0.15.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
