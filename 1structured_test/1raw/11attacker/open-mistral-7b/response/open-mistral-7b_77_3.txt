Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(A) = 15% (85% is white, so 15% is black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the attacker's race 20% of the time when the attacker is not black)

However, we don't have the value of P(B), the probability of the witness identifying any person as black. To find this, we can use the information that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. Since they get it right half the time by guessing, they must be correct an additional 40% of the time. So, P(B) = 0.5 + 0.4 * P(A) = 0.5 + 0.4 * 0.15 = 0.5 + 0.06 = 0.56

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.56 â‰ˆ 0.268

Therefore, based on the given information and assuming Bayes' theorem applies, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 26.8%.
