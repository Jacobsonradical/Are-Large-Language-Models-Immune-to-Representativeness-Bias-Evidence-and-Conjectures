The probability estimate would need to take into account the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20% (err rate). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is therefore 1 - 20% = 80%.

However, since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 15%. The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, probability estimate: 0.12}

So, based on the given information, we estimate that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black.
