Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about the attacker being identified correctly or incorrectly in this specific case by the witness.

To make an estimate, we could assume that the attacker was identified according to the witness's typical performance. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be the witness's correct identification rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this is an approximation and not a definitive answer. The actual probability could be higher or lower if the attacker was identified based on factors other than race, or if the witness's performance deviated from their usual accuracy in this specific case.

Therefore, based on the information given, the best estimate would be {probability: 0.8}.
