Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, the attack occurred at night when the witness could not see the attacker's race.

Since the witness's identification was based on assumptions or indirect clues, we cannot directly apply their accuracy rate from the given sample to the attacker's race. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an accurate estimate based on the provided information.

{probability: Unable to provide a number, as the information does not allow for a reliable estimate.}
