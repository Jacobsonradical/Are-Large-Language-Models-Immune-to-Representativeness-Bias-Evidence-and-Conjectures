Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's break it down:
1. The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15%.
2. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).
3. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black given that the person is black is 1 (since a black person is always identified as black by a perfect observer, which we assume the witness is not).
4. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.02 (2%), since the witness erred 20% of the time.

Now let's calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 1 (since a black person is always identified as black by a perfect observer)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B|not A) = 0.02 (the witness misidentified a white person as black 2% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)

P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.02 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.017 = 0.167

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.167 â‰ˆ 0.898

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.898 or 89.8%.
