Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the population statistics: 15% or 0.15.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is given by the witness's accuracy rate: 0.8 (80%).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is given by the witness's error rate: 0.2 (20%).

Since the attacker's race was not seen, the prior and likelihood for the attacker being white can be found by subtracting the prior and likelihood for the attacker being black from 1, respectively:

1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being white)
0.2 (likelihood of witness identifying attacker as black given attacker is white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / (P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white))

Plugging in the values:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the probability:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.231

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23.1%.
