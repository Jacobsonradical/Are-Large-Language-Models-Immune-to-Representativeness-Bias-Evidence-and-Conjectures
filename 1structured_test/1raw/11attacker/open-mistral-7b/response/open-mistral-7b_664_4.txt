To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we do not have information about whether the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of under- or over-estimating the black population. Since we do not have enough information to adjust for this bias, we will consider the 80% probability of correctly identifying a black person as a conservative estimate.

We also know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the fraction of the population that is black, multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, probability of 12%}

This estimate assumes that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between over- and under-estimating the black population, which may not be the case. If the witness is more likely to err towards underestimating the black population, the actual probability could be higher. But without more information, we cannot make that adjustment.
