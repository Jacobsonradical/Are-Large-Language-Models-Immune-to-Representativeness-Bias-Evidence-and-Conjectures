To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the city's population demographics and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The city's population demographics suggest that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black, even if the attacker was actually white. Let's denote:

- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black.
- P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is white.

From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15, P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.5 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black half the time).

We do not have enough information to calculate P(~B) directly, but we can find it by using Bayes' theorem:

P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(W) using the information about the witness's reliability:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.4225 = 0.6625

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.6625 â‰ˆ 0.217

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 21.7%.
