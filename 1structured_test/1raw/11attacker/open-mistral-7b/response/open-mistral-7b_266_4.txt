Based on the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

Given the information, we have:
- H: the attacker is black
- E: the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H) = 0.15 (as stated in the first piece of information)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)

We do not have direct information about P(E|~H) (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as non-black when the attacker is actually white), but we can compute it using the complementary probability:

P(E|~H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(E) is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Given that P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we can compute P(E):

P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can compute P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
