Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2) In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the population proportion is the same as the true racial distribution of the attackers. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can consider this as an additional "white" group (even if the actual person is black).

So in reality, the witness will consider 85% + 20% * 15% = 0.85 + 0.3 = 0.88 or 88% as white, and 15% as black (since the witness will mistakenly categorize some black people as white).

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we should not rely on this witness's testimony as the only source of information, especially considering the witness's error rate. Therefore, it would be more fair to assign an equal probability to both races, given the lack of concrete evidence.
