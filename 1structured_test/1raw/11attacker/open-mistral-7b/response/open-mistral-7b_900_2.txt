To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given the city's demographics in piece b, this is 15%.
2. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. Given piece a, this is 0.8 (or 80%).
3. P(A|B) is what we're trying to find.
4. P(B) is the probability of the witness making the identification. This can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - 0.15 or 0.85. Given piece a, P(B|not A) is 0.2 (or 20%). So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.16
         â‰ˆ 0.75

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
