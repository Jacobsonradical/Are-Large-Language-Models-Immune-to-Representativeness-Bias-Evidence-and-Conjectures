To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of a black person being misidentified as white.

Let's denote the probability of a black person being misidentified as white as p. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of a black person being correctly identified is 1 - p.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is 0.20.

However, we want to find the probability of a black person being misidentified as white. Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, for every misidentification of a black person as white, there are 2 misidentifications of white people as black. Therefore, the probability of a black person being misidentified as white (p) is equal to the probability of a white person being misidentified as black (0.20) divided by 2:

p = 0.20 / 2 = 0.10

Now we can find the probability of a black person being correctly identified by subtracting p from 1:

1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.90 or 90%. However, considering the uncertainty of the witness's identification and potential racial biases, a more conservative estimate might be around 80%, given the witness's accuracy rate.

{probability: 0.80, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This answer should be considered a rough estimate, as the actual probability may vary based on additional factors not accounted for in this analysis.
