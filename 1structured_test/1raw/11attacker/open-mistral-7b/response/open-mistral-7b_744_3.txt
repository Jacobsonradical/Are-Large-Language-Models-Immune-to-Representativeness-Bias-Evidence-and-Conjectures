To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the ethnic distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The city's population distribution: 85% of the city's population is white, while 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability of the witness's statement being true (the attacker is black) and the probability of the witness's statement being false (the attacker is white).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (true positive) is the product of the true racial distribution of the attacker and the witness's reliability in identifying black people:

P(true positive) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black | attacker is black)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as black (false positive) is the product of the false racial distribution of the attacker (assuming the witness errs in identifying white people as black) and the witness's reliability in identifying black people:

P(false positive) = P(attacker is white) * P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker as black | attacker is white)
= 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.17

Now, to find the probability of the witness's statement being true, we add the true positive and false positive probabilities and subtract the false positive probability:

P(witness statement is true) = P(true positive) + P(false positive) - P(false positive)
= 0.12 + 0.17 - 0.17
= 0.12

Since the witness's statement is true if the attacker is black, we can find the probability of the attacker being black by dividing the probability of the witness statement being true by the sum of both probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
