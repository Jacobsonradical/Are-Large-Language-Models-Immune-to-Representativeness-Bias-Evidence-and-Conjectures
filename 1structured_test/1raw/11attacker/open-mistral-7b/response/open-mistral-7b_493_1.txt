To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can consider the witness's identification as an error. So, if the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that they got it wrong, and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, if the witness's identification is correct, the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this happening is 1 minus the probability of error, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the racial composition of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it's more likely that a random attacker is white.

To incorporate both pieces of information, we can multiply the probability that the witness's identification is correct (0.8) by the probability of picking a black person in the city (0.15), and the probability that the witness is wrong (0.2) by the probability of picking a white person in the city (0.85).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.29} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
