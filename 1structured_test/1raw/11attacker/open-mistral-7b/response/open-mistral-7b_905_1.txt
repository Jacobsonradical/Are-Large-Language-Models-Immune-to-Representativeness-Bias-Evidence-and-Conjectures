Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, but they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's statement suggests that their identification of a person's race is not influenced by the racial demographics of the city. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, should be proportional to the number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people, the witness would be expected to identify a black person as such only 15% * 0.8 = 12% of the time they encounter a person (assuming encounters are random).

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means the attacker was either incorrectly identified or correctly identified. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (the probability of a correct identification).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8}. This estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge race is not influenced by the racial demographics of the city.
