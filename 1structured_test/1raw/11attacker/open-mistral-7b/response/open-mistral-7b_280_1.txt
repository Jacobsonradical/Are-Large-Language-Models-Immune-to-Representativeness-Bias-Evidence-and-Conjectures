Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to estimate)
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker not being black (which is 1 - P(H))

First, we need to find the probabilities P(E|H) and P(E|~H). Given that the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can infer that P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Next, we need to find the prior probability P(H). Since we don't have any information about the attacker's race, we can assume that it is equally likely to be black or white, so P(H) = P(~H) = 0.5.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.32, or 32%.
