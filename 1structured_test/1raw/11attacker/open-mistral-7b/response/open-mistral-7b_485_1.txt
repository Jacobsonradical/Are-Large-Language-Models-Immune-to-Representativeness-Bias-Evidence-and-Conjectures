The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the information as 15%)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (given in the information as 80%)
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (given in the information as 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, and we know that the attacker is not black with probability 1 - 0.85 = 0.15)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values given in the problem, we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this expression gives us:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
