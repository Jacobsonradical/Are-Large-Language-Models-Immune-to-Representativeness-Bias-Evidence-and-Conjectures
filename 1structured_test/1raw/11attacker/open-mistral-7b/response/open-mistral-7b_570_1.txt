To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time.
2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification:

The probability of a white person being misidentified as black is 0.2 (from the witness's reliability).
The probability of a black person being misidentified as white is also 0.2 (since the witness's mistakes are evenly distributed).

The probability of correctly identifying a white person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
The probability of correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the expected number of people (E) that the witness will encounter:

E = 0.8 * 0.85 (white people) + 0.8 * 0.15 (black people)
E = 0.68 + 0.12
E = 0.8

The witness encounters approximately 8 people. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, we would expect them to correctly identify the race of 0.8 * 8 = 6.4 people. However, since there are only 8 people in total, we can assume that the witness correctly identified the race of 6 people.

Of these 6 correctly identified people, it's likely that the attacker is one of them. Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the number of correctly identified people:

P(attacker is black) = number of black people among the correctly identified people / number of correctly identified people
P(attacker is black) = 15% of 6 / 6
P(attacker is black) = 0.15

However, the witness also incorrectly identified a person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we need to account for this possibility as well:

P(attacker is black given the witness's mistake) = 20% of 54% (the proportion of black people in the incorrectly identified group)
P(attacker is black given the witness's mistake) = 0.108

Adding these probabilities, we get an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is black:

P(attacker is black) = 0.15 + 0.108
P(attacker is black) = 0.258

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.258 or 25.8%.
