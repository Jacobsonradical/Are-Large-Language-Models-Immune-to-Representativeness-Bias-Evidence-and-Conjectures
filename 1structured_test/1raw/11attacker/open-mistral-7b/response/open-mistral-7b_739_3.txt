To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is the same for both races. Let's assume for now that the error rate is the same for both races (white and black).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness seeing a black person and misidentifying them as white:

1. The probability of the witness seeing a black person is 0.15 (15%).
2. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 0.20 (20%).
3. The probability of both events happening (seeing a black person and misidentifying them as white) is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).

Now we need to account for the cases where the witness correctly identifies a black person:

1. The probability of the witness seeing a black person and correctly identifying them is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (12%).

Since we don't know if the error rate is the same for both races, we cannot assume that all misidentifications are caused by the witness mistaking black people for white. Therefore, it's possible that some of the misidentifications actually correspond to white attackers.

In the best-case scenario for the attacker, all misidentifications by the witness are due to mistakes in identifying white people as black. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be:

1. The total probability of misidentifications is 0.03 (3%) + 0.12 (12%) = 0.15 (15%).
2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the misidentifications being caused by white attackers is 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.176 (17.6%).
3. The probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness misidentified someone, would be 1 - 0.176 = 0.824 (82.4%).

Without more information, it's impossible to provide a more precise estimate, but based on the given data, the attacker is likely black (with a probability between 82.4% and 100%, depending on the error rate for identifying black people as white).
