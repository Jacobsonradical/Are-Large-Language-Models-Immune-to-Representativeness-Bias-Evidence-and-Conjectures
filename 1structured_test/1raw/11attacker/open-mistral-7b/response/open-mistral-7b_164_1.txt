Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct, and the city's racial distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified a black person as the attacker.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's reliability in identifying black people)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 (the overall probability of the witness identifying a black person, considering both their reliability and the racial distribution of the city)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.5833

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 58.33%.
