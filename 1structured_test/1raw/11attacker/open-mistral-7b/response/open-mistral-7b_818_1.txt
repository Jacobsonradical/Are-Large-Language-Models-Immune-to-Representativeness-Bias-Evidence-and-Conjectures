Based on the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%. Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate could be due to mistakenly identifying white individuals as black, rather than the other way around.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The witness's observed probability of correctly identifying a black individual as such is 0.8, or 80%. Given the population statistics, the probability of the witness observing a white individual and mistakenly identifying them as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, or 3%.

Given these probabilities, we can set up an equation to represent the witness's observed error rate:

0.2 = 0.15 * 0.2 * P(black) + 0.03 * (1 - P(black))

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.03) / (0.15 * 0.2 + 0.03 * (1 - 0.15))

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.2222

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22.22%.
