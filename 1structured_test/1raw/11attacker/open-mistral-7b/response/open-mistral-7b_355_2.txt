Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population distribution, and the new evidence is the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness's observation.

First, let's calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = 0.2 (error rate)

Next, we calculate P(A):

P(A) = 0.15 (population of black people)

Now, calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.85 (population of white people) + 0.15 (population of black people) = 0.85 * 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.2625

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.2625
      = 0.03

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation, is approximately 3%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both white and black people, which may not be the case. If the error rate is higher for one group, the probability estimate could be different. Without this information, we can only provide an estimate based on the given data.
