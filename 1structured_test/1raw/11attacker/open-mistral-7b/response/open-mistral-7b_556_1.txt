Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- π(H): prior probability of H (given in the first piece of information: 15%)
- E: the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- π(E|H): likelihood of E given H (given in the second piece of information: the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- π(E|~H): likelihood of E given not H (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, where ~H denotes the attacker is white)

Then, the probability of H given E (the posterior probability) can be estimated as:

π(H|E) = π(E|H) * π(H) / [π(E|H) * π(H) + π(E|~H) * π(~H)]

Using the given values, this can be computed as:

π(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

π(H|E) ≈ 0.26

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 26%.
