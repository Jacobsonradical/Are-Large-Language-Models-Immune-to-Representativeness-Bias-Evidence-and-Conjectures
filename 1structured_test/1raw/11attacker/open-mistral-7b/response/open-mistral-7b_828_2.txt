Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial demographics of the city suggest that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. This means that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, and in 20% of cases, the witness makes an error.

However, the witness's error rate is not specified in terms of identifying black people as white or white people as black. For the purpose of this calculation, we will assume that the error rate is equal for both races (which is not necessarily the case, but without more information, we cannot make a more precise assumption).

3. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race, we should consider both the probability of the witness's identification being correct and the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. The probability of the witness's identification being incorrect is the error rate, which we assume to be 20%.

4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness's identification being correct: 15%.

However, the witness's identification was that the attacker was black. If the witness had identified the attacker as white, we would have to consider the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect, which is 20%.

5. Since the witness's identification was that the attacker was black, we should focus on the probability of the witness's identification being correct, which is 15%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, is 15%.
