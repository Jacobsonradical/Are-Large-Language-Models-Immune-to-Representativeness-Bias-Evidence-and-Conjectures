To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. Since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can treat the witness's identification as a binary random variable, where a correct identification is a success and an incorrect identification is a failure.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(White) = 1 - P(Black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event occurring is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying black people:

P(Witness said Black | Attacker is Black) = P(Black) * 0.8

On the other hand, if the attacker is white, the probability of the witness identifying him as black is the witness's error rate:

P(Witness said Black | Attacker is White) = P(White) * 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the observed event is either P(Witness said Black | Attacker is Black) or P(Witness said Black | Attacker is White). We can write this as:

P(Witness said Black) = P(Witness said Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness said Black | Attacker is White) * P(White)

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8, so we can set this equal to the observed probability and solve for P(Black):

0.8 = 0.8 * P(Black) + 0.2 * P(White)

Using the information that 85% of the population is white, we can find P(White):

P(White) = 1 - P(Black) = 0.85

Now, we can rewrite the equation and solve for P(Black):

0.8 = 0.8 * P(Black) + 0.2 * 0.85

P(Black) = 0.5

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.5 or 50%.
