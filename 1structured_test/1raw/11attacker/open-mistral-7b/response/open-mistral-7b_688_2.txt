Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographic data.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, if the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. The city's demographic data tells us that 15% of the population is black.

So, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated as the sum of the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being black, and the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker still being black.

The probability of the witness being correct is 1 - the probability of the witness being wrong, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

The probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness is correct, is 0.15 (the city's black population percentage).

Therefore, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
