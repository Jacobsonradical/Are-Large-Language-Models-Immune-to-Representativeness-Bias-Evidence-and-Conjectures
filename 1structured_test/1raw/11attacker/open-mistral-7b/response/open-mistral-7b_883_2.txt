Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have information on whether the witness was present at the scene or not, or if their identification of the attacker as black was based on reliable evidence.

Since we cannot make an assumption about the witness's presence or the reliability of their identification, the most conservative approach would be to use the population statistics alone. This would suggest that the attacker is most likely white, given that 85% of the population is white.

Therefore, without more information, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the witness's identification. But if we must make an estimate based on the witness's identification, it would be 80% (given by the witness's accuracy rate), but this estimate is likely to be biased due to the witness's error rate and the possibility that they were not present at the scene. Therefore, it's important to consider these factors and not rely solely on the witness's identification.

In summary:
{probability: unable to provide a reliable estimate, please consider the limitations of the witness's identification and the population statistics.}
