To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event given new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of evidence B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of evidence B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification, and we have the following values:
- P(A|B) is the probability we're trying to find
- P(B|A) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (0.8)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we need to estimate)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the identification they did (which is given as 0.85 by the population data)

We can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Now, we can solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / 0.85

We don't have a value for P(A), so we can't provide a numerical estimate yet. However, we can say that the probability of the attacker being black is some value between 0 and 1 that satisfies this equation.

To find the exact value, we would need additional information or make an assumption about P(A). Without that, we can't provide a specific number.
