Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony, taking into account the prior probability of the attacker being black in the population.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. This is given as 0.8 (80%) in the problem statement.

2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 0.15 (15%) in the problem statement.

3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, regardless of the person's actual race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person:

   P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

   where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 (20%) in the problem statement. P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

   Using the given values, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26.

4. Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

   P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
   = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
   = 0.296

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.296 or 29.6%.
