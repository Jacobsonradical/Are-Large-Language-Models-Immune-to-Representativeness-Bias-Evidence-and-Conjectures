To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, we don't have information on what percentage of their errors involve misidentifying whites as blacks, and what percentage involve misidentifying blacks as whites. Without this information, we cannot accurately adjust the witness's statements for this specific case.

On the other hand, we know the racial composition of the city to be 85% white and 15% black. If we were to assume that the witness's errors are random and do not favor any race, then the witness's statement could be biased towards the majority race (in this case, white).

However, without more information, it's not possible to provide a numerically precise estimate. Therefore, the best we can do is to express uncertainty. The witness's statement suggests that the attacker could be black, but without more information, we cannot quantify that probability accurately.

In conclusion, while the witness's statement suggests that the attacker could be black, without more information, we cannot provide a numerically precise probability estimate. Please consult a statistician or an expert in this field for a more accurate analysis.
