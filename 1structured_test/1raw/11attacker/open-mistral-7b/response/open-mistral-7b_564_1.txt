To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, in this case, they identified the attacker as black, which could be an error given that the majority of the city's population is white.

To account for this potential error, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (that the attacker is black) given that they actually did identify someone as black.

Let's denote the probability of a black attacker as P(Black), and the probability of a white attacker as P(White) = 1 - P(Black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they are correct is P(Black) * Witness's accuracy in identifying black people + P(White) * Witness's error rate in identifying black people.

This can be written as:

P(Correct Identification | Black Attacker) = P(Black) * 0.8 + P(White) * 0.2

Since the total population is 100% white and black, we know that P(Black) + P(White) = 1.

We are given that 85% of the population is white, so P(White) = 0.85 and P(Black) = 0.15.

Now we can plug these values into the equation:

P(Correct Identification | Black Attacker) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and their identification was likely correct 29% of the time, it seems that the attacker might actually be black with a probability of 0.29. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on imperfect information and should be viewed with caution.
