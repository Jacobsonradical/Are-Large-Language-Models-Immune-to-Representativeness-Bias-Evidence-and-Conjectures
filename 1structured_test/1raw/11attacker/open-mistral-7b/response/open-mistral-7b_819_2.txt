To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is not actually black.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is the proportion of black people in the city, adjusted for the witness's error rate.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, or 17%.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12, or 12%.

Since the witness reported seeing a black person, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(B) = 0.17 (witness error) + 0.12 (witness correct)
    = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
