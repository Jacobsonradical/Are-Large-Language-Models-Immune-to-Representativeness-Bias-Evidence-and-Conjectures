To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of them mistakenly identifying a white person as black:

1. The probability of a random person being white is 0.85 (from information b).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is the probability of a white person times the error rate, which is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, the attacker must be either black or a falsely identified black person (from information a). The probability of the attacker being a falsely identified black person is 0.17.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black (either genuinely black or mistakenly identified as black) is 1 - the probability of the attacker being a falsely identified black person:

1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
