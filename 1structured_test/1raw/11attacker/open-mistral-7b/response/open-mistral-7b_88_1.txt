To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can infer that in situations where the actual race is black, the witness will correctly identify it as black 80% of the time. Conversely, in situations where the actual race is white, the witness will incorrectly identify it as black 20% of the time.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black:

The witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black 80% of the time.
The witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% of the time for a white attacker, multiplied by the probability of encountering a white person).

So the total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

However, since the witness's statement is the only evidence we have, we can't exclude the possibility that the witness made an error this time. Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be the probability of the witness making an error when a white attacker is identified, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Given that this is the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect when the attacker is white, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
