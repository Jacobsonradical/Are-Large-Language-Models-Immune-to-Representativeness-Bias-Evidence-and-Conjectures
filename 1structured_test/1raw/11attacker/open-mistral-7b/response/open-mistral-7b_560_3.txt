Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness's identification was not accurate in this case. This means the witness misidentified the attacker's race, which implies an error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can assume that the error made by the witness is equal to the probability that the attacker is not black (given that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black).

Given that the witness misidentifies race 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is not black is 0.20. Since 85% of the population is white, and the witness's error rate is equal to the probability that the attacker is not black, we can assume that the attacker is white 85% of the time.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.
