Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about how this witness identified the attacker specifically. Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can only consider the witness's racial bias and their accuracy rate in our estimate.

Without knowing the specific circumstances under which the witness identified the attacker as black, it's not possible to make a precise probability estimate. However, we can make an approximate estimate based on the witness's accuracy rate.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time, we can assume that in 80% of the times the witness had a chance to identify a race, they correctly identified it. Since the majority of people in the city are white, this means that the witness most likely identified a white person 80% of the time and a black person 20% of the time.

Considering that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that in 1 out of 5 times they identified a black person, they made an error. This means that in 4 out of 5 times they correctly identified a black person as such.

Therefore, our approximate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be 4 out of 5, which is equal to 0.8. However, as mentioned earlier, this is an approximate estimate based on the limited information provided. A more precise estimate would require more specific information about the witness's identification process.
