Given the information provided, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as the witness's observation was biased and incorrect in 20% of the cases. However, we can make an educated guess based on the city's demographics and the witness's performance.

The witness incorrectly identified a person's race 20% of the time, and 85% of the city's population is white. Therefore, we can infer that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

This means that the witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time, and also correctly identified a white person as white 85% of the time. Since 15% of the city's population is black, we can infer that the witness correctly identified a black person as black 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% of the time when the actual person was white.

In conclusion, the witness's performance suggests that the probability of the attacker being black is higher than the city's demographic proportion of 15%, but we can't determine an exact number without more information. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that the attacker is black to be somewhere between 12% and 15%.

{probability: [12%, 15%]}
