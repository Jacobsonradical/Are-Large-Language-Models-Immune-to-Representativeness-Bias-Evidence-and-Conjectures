To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, there is a 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, is the proportion of black people among the total population that the witness saw.

Since the witness saw half white and half black people, the probability of seeing a black person among the people the witness saw is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, is 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black by multiplying the probability of the witness making a correct identification by the probability of the attacker being black given a correct identification, and by adding this to the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being white:

0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.4

Therefore, our estimate is {probability: 0.4} that the attacker is black.
