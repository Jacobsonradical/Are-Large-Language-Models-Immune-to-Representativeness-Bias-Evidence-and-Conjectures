Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2. The racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as such,
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black,
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, which we want to find,
- P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black.

We are given that P(B) = 0.15, P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.2. We can also calculate P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values and performing the calculations, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / 0.17
       â‰ˆ 0.706

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 70.6%.
