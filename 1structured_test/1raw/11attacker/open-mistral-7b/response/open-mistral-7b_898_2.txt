Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about whether the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying black people as white or vice versa.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Assuming that the witness's error rate is not biased, the most likely explanation for the witness identifying the attacker as black is that the attacker actually was black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, if the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying black people as white, then it's possible that the attacker was actually white but the witness misidentified them as black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be lower than 0.15.

Without more information, it's not possible to provide a more precise estimate. Therefore, based on the available information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (or 15%).
