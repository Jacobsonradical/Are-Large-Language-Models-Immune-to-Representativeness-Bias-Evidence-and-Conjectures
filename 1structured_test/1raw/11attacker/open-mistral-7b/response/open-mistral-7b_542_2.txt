Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (this is a bit more complex, but it can be calculated using the probability of the witness making a mistake and the prior probability of the attacker being black)

Unfortunately, I don't have the necessary information to calculate P(E) directly. However, if we assume that the witness's errors are independent of the attacker's race (a strong assumption, but let's go with it for now), we can estimate P(E) as:

P(E) = P(correct identification) * P(attacker is black) + P(mistake) * P(attacker is white)

Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(mistake) = 0.2, and since 15% of the population is black, P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

However, we don't have the value of P(correct identification), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person. If we assume that this probability is the same as the probability of making a mistake for black people (0.2), then P(correct identification) = 0.8.

Under this assumption, we can calculate P(E) to be approximately 0.12 (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85).

Using this value of P(E), we can estimate P(H|E) to be approximately 0.54 (0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12).

So, given the assumptions made, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.54, or 54%.
