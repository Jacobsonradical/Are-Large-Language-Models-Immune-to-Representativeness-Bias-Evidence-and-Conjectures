Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. If we assume that the attacker's race is actually white (the majority), then the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. On the other hand, if the attacker is actually black, then the witness would correctly identify the attacker 80% of the time.

The probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies the race, and the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies the race:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of correct identification by witness * Probability of attacker being black
                                             + Probability of incorrect identification by witness * Probability of attacker being white

Let's denote:
p_b = Probability of attacker being black = 0.15
p_w = Probability of attacker being white = 0.85
p_c = Probability of correct identification by witness = 0.8
p_e = Probability of incorrect identification by witness = 0.2

Then the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as:

0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
