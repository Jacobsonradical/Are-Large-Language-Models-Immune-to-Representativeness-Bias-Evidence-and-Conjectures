To provide an estimate, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the actual racial distribution of the population.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can infer that when the witness sees a white person, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.

The frequency of witnessing a white person in the city is 0.85, and the frequency of witnessing a black person is 0.15. Since the witness errs in identifying a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness actually seeing a black person but mistakenly identifying them as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).

Now, let's consider the witness's correct identifications. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time. Since there is a 15% chance that the witness encounters a black person, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we also need to account for the times the witness correctly identifies a white person. The witness correctly identifies a white person 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68 (68%) of the time. Since there is an 85% chance that the witness encounters a white person, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is 0.85 * 0.68 = 0.57 (57%).

But, we've already accounted for the 3% of times when the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black. To account for these cases, we need to subtract them from the total probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person. So, the actual probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is 0.57 - 0.03 = 0.54 (54%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and we know that the witness is wrong about 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.12.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time and that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).

So, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the reliability of that identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.12) plus the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black (0.17).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).
