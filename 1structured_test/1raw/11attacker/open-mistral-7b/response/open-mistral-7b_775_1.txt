Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (the witness's reliability).
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we know is 15% from the city's demographics.
- P(B) as the prior probability of the witness identifying a person as black, which can be calculated based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

We are asked to find P(A|B), but we have enough information to find P(B|A) and P(B).

1. Calculate P(B|A): This is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies the race, and 15% of the population is black, we have:

   P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of a correct identification) * 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black) = 0.12

2. Calculate P(B): This is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and half of the population is black, we have:

   P(B) = 0.5 (the probability of a random person being black or white) * 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person) = 0.4

3. Apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

   P(A|B) = 0.12 * 0.15 / 0.4 = 0.03

So, based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 3%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is subject to several assumptions and uncertainties, such as the reliability of the witness and the conditions under which the witness made the identification.
