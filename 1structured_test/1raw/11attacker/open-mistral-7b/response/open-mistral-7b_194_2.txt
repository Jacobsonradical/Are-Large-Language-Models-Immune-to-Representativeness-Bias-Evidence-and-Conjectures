To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, `P(H)` is the prior probability of the hypothesis, `P(E|H)` is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and `P(E)` is the probability of the evidence.

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(H) (prior probability of the attacker being black) = 15% (from part b)
2. P(E|H) (likelihood of the witness's identification given the attacker is black) = 0.8 (from part a)
3. P(E) (probability of the witness's identification) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   P(E|not H) (likelihood of the witness's identification given the attacker is not black) = 0.2 (from part a)
   P(not H) (prior probability of the attacker not being black) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (from part b)
   So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.14 â‰ˆ 0.643

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 64.3%.
