Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, is not always reliable in determining race, with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

The witness's testimony alone suggests that the attacker is black, but we need to account for the uncertainty in the witness's identification. We can do this by calculating the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black and attribute the attack to a black person.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a race 20% of the time, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 20% (the error rate) times 0.85 (the proportion of white people).

So, P(witness errs and identifies white person as black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is black by subtracting this probability from the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black)
                  = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black person) + P(witness errs and identifies white person as black)
                  = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.17
                  = 0.27 (or 27%)

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.27 (or 27%). This estimate accounts for the uncertainty in the witness's identification.
