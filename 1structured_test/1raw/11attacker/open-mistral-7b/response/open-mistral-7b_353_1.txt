Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a rule that allows us to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black) given the evidence (the witness's identification). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. This is given to us as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence. We'll estimate this based on the city's demographics.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of whether they are black or not. We can calculate this as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H means "not black". Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.833

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.833 or 83.3%.
