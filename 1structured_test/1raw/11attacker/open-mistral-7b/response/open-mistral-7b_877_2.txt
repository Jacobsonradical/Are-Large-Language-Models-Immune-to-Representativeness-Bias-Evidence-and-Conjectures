To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "attacker is black"
- W as the event "witness identifies attacker as black"

We are given two probabilities: P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black), and P(W|A) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker). We are also given the base rate of black people in the city, P(A), which is 15% according to information b.

We are also given the probability of the witness misidentifying a black attacker as white, P(~A|W), which is equal to 1 - P(A|W) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness was correct 80% of the time).

We can now calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Given that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.03] = 0.12 / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.8

So, given the witness's identification, our updated estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 or 80%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's reliability and the base rate of black people in the city. If the witness's reliability was lower, or if the base rate of black people was different, the estimate would be different. This calculation should be used as a starting point for further investigation, not as the final answer.
