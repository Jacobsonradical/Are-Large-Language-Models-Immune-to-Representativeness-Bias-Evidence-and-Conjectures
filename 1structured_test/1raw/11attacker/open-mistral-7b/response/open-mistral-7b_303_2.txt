To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two races (white and black), then the witness identifies blacks as white 10% of the time (20% error rate / 2) and whites as black 10% of the time (20% error rate / 2).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15. Since the witness errs 10% of the time by identifying a white person as black, the actual proportion of black people the witness encounters and correctly identifies as black is 0.15 - 0.10 = 0.05 or 5%.

However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that the real proportion of attackers who are black must be higher than 5%. Since the witness's error rate is just 20%, the true proportion of black attackers must be at least 2 times the proportion of black people the witness encounters and correctly identifies as black, which is 0.10 or 10%.

Therefore, based on the provided information, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is 0.10 or 10%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two races, which may not be the case in reality. Additionally, this estimate does not take into account any other evidence that may be available about the attacker.
