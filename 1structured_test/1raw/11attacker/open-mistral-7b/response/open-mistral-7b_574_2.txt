Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have a witness who, in similar conditions, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.
4. Due to the witness's error rate, there is a chance that the witness mistook a white person for a black person.
5. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's error rate, we can subtract the probability of the witness making a mistake from 100%.
6. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of making a mistake is 20%.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's error, is 100% - 20% = {probability: 0.8} or 80%.

This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual attacker's race. If the witness has a bias or is more likely to mistake one race for the other, the calculation would need to account for that as well.
