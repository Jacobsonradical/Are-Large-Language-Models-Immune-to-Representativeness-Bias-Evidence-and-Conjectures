To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, meaning they correctly identify it 80% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that the witness is correct in this instance (since they correctly identified race 80% of the time).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is white, which makes up 85% of the city's population. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. So, even if the attacker is white, there's a 0.2 probability that the witness would incorrectly identify them as black (since they err in 20% of their white identifications).

The probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black is 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.2 (probability of witness error in identifying a white person as black) = 0.17 or 17%.

Since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we can calculate this by subtracting the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black from 1: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
