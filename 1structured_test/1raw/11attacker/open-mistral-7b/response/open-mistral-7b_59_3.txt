To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's statement. In this case, the probability is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's statement suggests that they are more likely to misidentify a white person as black than vice versa. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is more likely to be correct than an incorrect identification of a white person as black.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can adjust the 0.15 probability accordingly. To do this, we can subtract the 20% error rate from the 0.15 probability:

0.15 - 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.15 - 0.02 = 0.13

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.13 (13%). This means that, given the witness's statement and the racial composition of the city, there is a slightly higher likelihood that the attacker is black than white, but the evidence is not strong enough to rule out the possibility that the attacker is white.
