Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability for a hypothesis given evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from information "a"). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as black, given that the attacker is indeed black, is 0.8 (from information "b").

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (from information "b"). Since the population is 85% white, the prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = (P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)) / (P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Computing gives:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 24%.
