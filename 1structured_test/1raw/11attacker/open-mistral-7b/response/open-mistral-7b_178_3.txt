Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. Since we know that the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black, we need to account for both the witness's accurate identification and errors.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We can write the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black as P(black | witness_black), which is the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. Similarly, we can write the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white as P(witness_black | not black), which is the witness's error rate of 20%.

The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(witness_black) = P(black | witness_black) * P(black) + P(witness_black | not black) * P(not black)

We are given the values of P(black) = 0.15 and P(witness_black | not black) = 0.2. To find the value of P(black | witness_black), we can use the equation:

P(black | witness_black) = P(witness_black) / 0.8

Now, we can substitute these values into the equation for P(witness_black):

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.143

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14.3%.
