The probability of the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's statement
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15%
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is white 85% of the time, and the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying white people as black, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement as:
