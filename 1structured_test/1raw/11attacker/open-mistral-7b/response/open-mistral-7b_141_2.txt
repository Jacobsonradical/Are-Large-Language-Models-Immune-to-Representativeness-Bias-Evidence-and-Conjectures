Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the attacker's actual race and the witness's identification of the attacker's race. Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can't directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the attacker's race.

However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In our case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black, and P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying a black person) and P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black in the city).

However, we don't have the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker as something else (P(not A|B)), which is needed to calculate P(B). We can make an assumption that the witness's error rate is the same for both races, but without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimation.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer in the format you've requested. However, given the assumption of equal error rates, the estimate would be higher than 0.15, but lower than 0.8.
