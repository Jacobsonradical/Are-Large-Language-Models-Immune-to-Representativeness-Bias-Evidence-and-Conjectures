To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the overall demographic distribution of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time.

2. The demographic distribution: The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability based on these two factors:

1. If we assume that the witness is completely unreliable and identifies a person's race randomly, we would expect the witness to identify a white person as black 15% of the time (since 15% of the population is black) and a black person as white 85% of the time (since 85% of the population is white).

2. However, the witness is not completely unreliable. In fact, they incorrectly identify a person's race 20% of the time. So, in reality, they might mistakenly identify a black person as white 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3% of the time.

3. On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12% of the time.

4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the two probabilities we calculated in step 3.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is {probability: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15, or 15%}. This means that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided. It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and actual probabilities may differ in real-world scenarios.
