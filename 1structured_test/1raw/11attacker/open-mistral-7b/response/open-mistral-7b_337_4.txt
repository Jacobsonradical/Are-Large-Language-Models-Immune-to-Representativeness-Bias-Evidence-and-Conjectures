Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness who is usually correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%). The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race given that the attacker is black is 0.2 (20%).

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black. So, we are interested in the probability of this event happening, given that the attacker is black. This is the conditional probability P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is black and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics), and we need to find P(B).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is equally likely to see a white or a black person, and is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the witness identifies a black person as white is 0.2. Therefore, the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is also 0.2.

Given that the witness sees a black person 85% of the time (the proportion of black people in the population), the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68. Since the witness sees a white person 15% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

Now we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.185

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.185, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
