Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness's identification of the attacker's race is independent of the city's population composition. This means that the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is the same as the probability of a black person being in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is also 20%, as this is an error in the opposite direction.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the proportion of true positives (correctly identifying a black person) to the total number of black people in the population.

The total number of black people in the population is 0.15 * total population.

The total number of black people the witness could have mistakenly identified as white is 0.15 * total population * 0.2 = 0.03 * total population.

So, the total number of actual black people the witness correctly identified is (0.15 * total population) - 0.03 * total population = 0.12 * total population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 * total population / (0.15 * total population) = 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
