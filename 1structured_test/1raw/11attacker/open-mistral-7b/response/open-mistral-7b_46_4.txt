Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's observation, is 0.8.

However, we should consider the racial demographics of the city as well. The city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness made an error in identifying the race, we can't rely solely on their observation. To account for this, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we need to adjust this probability to account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can expect that 20% of their identifications of a black person as black will actually be mistakes. This means that out of the 15% of black people in the city, the witness might incorrectly label as black 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3% of the population.

The actual number of black attackers in the city is then 0.15 - 0.03 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. So, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the proportion of black attackers in the city out of all attackers. Since we don't have information about the racial distribution of attackers, we can't calculate this directly.

But we can make an approximation. If we assume that the racial distribution of attackers is the same as the racial distribution of the general population, then the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the prior probability of a black attacker divided by the total probability of a black or a white attacker being identified as black by the witness.

The total probability of a black or a white attacker being identified as black by the witness is the sum of the prior probability of a black attacker and the prior probability of a white attacker times the witness's error rate.

The prior probability of a white attacker is 0.85 (100% - 15%). The total probability of a black or a white attacker being identified as black by the witness is then 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is then 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%.

It's important to note that this is an approximation, and the actual probability could be different depending on the racial distribution of attackers. Without more information, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%. This is an estimate and should be treated as such.
