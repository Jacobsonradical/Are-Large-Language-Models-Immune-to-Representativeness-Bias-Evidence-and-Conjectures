To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, there is a chance that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a randomly chosen person being black is 0.15.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W). We have two equations based on the given information:

1) P(B) + P(W) = 1 (total probability)
2) 0.8 * P(W) + 0.2 * P(B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate)

Since we are only interested in the probability of the attacker being black, let's solve for P(B).

From equation 1, P(W) = 1 - P(B)

Substitute P(W) into equation 2:

0.8 * (1 - P(B)) + 0.2 * P(B) = 0.2

Solve for P(B):

0.2P(B) + 0.6 - 0.8P(B) = 0.2
-0.6P(B) = -0.2
P(B) = 0.1/0.6 = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.1667, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
