Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they are wrong 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't have any information about whether the witness was more likely to make a mistake when identifying a black person as white or a white person as black.

Assuming an unbiased error rate (i.e., the witness makes errors at a constant rate regardless of the race of the person they are identifying), we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness statement) = [P(witness statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness statement | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Using the given information, we can calculate that:

P(witness statement | attacker is black) = 0.8
P(witness statement | attacker is white) = 0.2 (since the witness makes errors 20% of the time)
P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white)
P(attacker is white) = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of 0.26 or 26%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption of an unbiased error rate, which may not be accurate in real-world situations. In general, it's important to approach such questions with caution and consider potential sources of bias in the witness's statements.
