Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80% by the witness's accuracy.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the racial demographics of the city. This is given as 15% (0.15) by the second piece of information.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's description, which is the probability of describing any person as black. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of describing a random person as black is 15% (0.15).

Now we can compute the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.15) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is 0.8 (or 80%).
