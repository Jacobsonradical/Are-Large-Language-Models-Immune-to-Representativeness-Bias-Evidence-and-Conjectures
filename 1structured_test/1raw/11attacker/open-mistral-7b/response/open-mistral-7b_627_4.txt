Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, where they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the city's racial composition and the witness's ability to identify race: The attacker's race is not necessarily the same as the racial makeup of the city or the racial composition of the people the witness saw that night.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black should be considered as evidence, but it's not definitive proof. To account for the possibility of the witness making an error, we can adjust the probability based on their track record.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can assume that there's a 20% chance that they made an error in this case and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can assume that there's an 80% chance that they correctly identified the attacker as black.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and their ability to identify race, would be 0.8 (80%).
