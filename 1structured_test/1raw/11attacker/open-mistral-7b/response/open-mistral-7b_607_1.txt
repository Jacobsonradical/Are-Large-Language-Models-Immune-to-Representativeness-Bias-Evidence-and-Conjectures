Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the accuracy of the witness in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's description of the attacker being black is not directly supported by the victim's inability to see the attacker's race. In this scenario, we would typically rely on the racial composition of the city as the primary source of information.

That being said, we should consider the possibility that the witness's mistake rate might be different for situations where they can't see the person's race. Without this information, we cannot adjust the witness's accuracy rate to account for night conditions.

Therefore, based on the available information, we estimate the probability of the attacker being black to be 0.15 (15%), which is the racial composition of the black population in the city.

{probability: 0.15}
