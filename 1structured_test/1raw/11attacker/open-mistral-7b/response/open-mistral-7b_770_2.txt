To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, we don't have enough information to know whether the witness's error rate is biased towards underestimating or overestimating the presence of black people.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the expected frequency of black people that the witness would correctly identify.

If the witness's error rate is not biased, then the probability of correctly identifying a black person should be equal to their proportion in the population. So, the expected number of correct identifications of black people is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12 out of 100 people).

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we would expect them to correctly identify a black person as such in 0.12 * 0.8 = 0.096 (9.6 out of 100 times).

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that the actual number of correct identifications is more than 0.096. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our probability estimate.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as such. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write:

P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know P(W|B) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.15, and P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B).

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(W|not B), we can't provide a precise probability estimate. However, given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can say that P(W|not B) is likely to be lower than 0.8, which means that P(B) is likely to be higher than the 0.096 we calculated earlier.

Based on this analysis, it seems likely that the attacker is black, but we can't provide a precise probability estimate without more information. Therefore, the answer is: {probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
