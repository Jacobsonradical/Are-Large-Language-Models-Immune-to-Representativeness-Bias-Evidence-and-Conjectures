Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's break it down:
1. Prior probability of A (attacker being black) is 15% as stated in the first piece of information.
2. Probability of B given A (witness correctly identifying black attacker) is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
3. Probability of B given not-A (witness erring in identifying attacker) is the witness's error rate, 0.2.

To find the probability of not-A (attacker being white), we subtract the probability of A from 1, so it's 85%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of B:

P(B) = P(B given A) * P(A) + P(B given not-A) * P(not-A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of A given B:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A | B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, based on the given information and Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3448.
