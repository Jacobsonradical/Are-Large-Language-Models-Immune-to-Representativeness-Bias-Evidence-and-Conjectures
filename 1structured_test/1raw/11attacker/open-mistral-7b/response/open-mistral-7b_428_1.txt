To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (irrespective of the hypothesis)

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H denotes the opposite of H, i.e., the attacker is white)

The value of P(E|~H) is not given, but we can calculate it using the fact that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, so they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time as well. Since 85% of the population is white, this means that P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.0176.

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.0176 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
