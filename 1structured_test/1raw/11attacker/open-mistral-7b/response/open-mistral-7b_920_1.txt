To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we don't know but want to estimate.
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given in the information, it's the witness's accuracy rate: 0.8.
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is black. This is a complex probability that we don't have direct information about, but we can infer it by considering the witness's error rate. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, and there are equal numbers of whites and blacks in the sample, the probability of the witness making an error on a black person is the same as the probability of making an error on a white person. Since there are twice as many whites as blacks, the probability of a witness error on a white person is 0.4. So, the probability of the witness making the correct identification on a black person is its complement, 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.
- P(B|~W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as not black given that the attacker is black. This is simply the error rate, 0.2.
- P(W) as the prior probability of the witness making the observation. This is the proportion of the population that is white, which is given: 0.85.
- P(~W) as the prior probability of the witness making the observation not happening. This is the complement of P(W), 0.15.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know P(W|B), P(B), and P(W). We want to find P(B). So we rewrite the equation to solve for P(B):

P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
P(B) = (0.6) * P(B) / 0.85

Now we can solve for P(B):

P(B) = 0.6 * P(B) / 0.85
P(B) = 0.72 * P(B)

To find a specific value for P(B), we can assume a value for it, solve the equation, and then see if it makes sense in the context. For example, if we assume P(B) = 0.2 (15%), we get:

P(B) = (0.6) * 0.2 / 0.85
P(B) = 0.072 / 0.85
P(B) = 0.086

So under the assumption that the attacker is 15% likely to be black, the witness's identification of the attacker as black makes it 8.6% likely that the attacker is black. This seems unlikely, as it would imply that the witness is significantly less accurate than their stated 80% rate.

If we assume a higher probability for the attacker being black, say 0.5 (50%), we get:

P(B) = (0.6) * 0.5 / 0.85
P(B) = 0.24 / 0.85
P(B) = 0.28

Now the witness's identification makes it 28% likely that the attacker is black, which seems more reasonable.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification, it seems plausible that the attacker is around 28-30% likely to be black. However, this is an estimate based on Bayes' theorem and the given information, and it should be interpreted with caution. It would be important to consider other evidence and factors, such as the witness's reliability and the attack's other characteristics.
