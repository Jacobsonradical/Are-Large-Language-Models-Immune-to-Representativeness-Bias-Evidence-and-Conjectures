Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observation E.

We know the values of P(E|H) (0.8) and P(H) (0.15) from the information given. To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

where ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

We are told that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8. The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2. We are also told that 85% of the population is white, so P(~H) = 0.85.

To find P(H), we can use the fact that P(H) + P(~H) = 1:

P(H) = 1 - P(~H) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can compute P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.1765
     = 0.2965

Finally, we can compute P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2965
      = 0.12 / 0.2965
      = 0.4032

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4032 or 40.32%.
