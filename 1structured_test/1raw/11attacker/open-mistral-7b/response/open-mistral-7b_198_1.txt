Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, there is no direct information about how the witness's performance might be affected by the actual distribution of races in the population. In a balanced population (50% white and 50% black), the witness's error rate would be expected to be equal for both races. But in a city where 85% of the population is white, it's reasonable to assume that the error rate for identifying a black person might be higher due to the rarity of that race in the population.

Unfortunately, the information provided does not allow us to quantify this effect or to make an accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. Therefore, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as the answer to this question.

It would be necessary to have more information, such as how the witness's error rate for identifying black people differs from their error rate for identifying white people in a population with the given distribution, in order to make a reliable estimate.
