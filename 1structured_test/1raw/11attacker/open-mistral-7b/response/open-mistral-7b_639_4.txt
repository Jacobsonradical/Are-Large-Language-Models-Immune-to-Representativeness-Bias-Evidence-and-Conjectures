To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence: the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In our problem:
- P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is black. We don't have this information, so we'll assume it's unknown.
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given to be 0.8 (80%).
- P(E): the probability of the witness making the statement E, given that the attacker is black or white. This can be calculated as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H means not H (the attacker is white).

We are given that 85% of the population is white, so P(~H) = 0.15. The probability P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black. This is given to be 0.2 (20%).

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * P(H)) / 0.2925

To find the exact value of P(H), we would need more information. However, we can make an estimation based on the population distribution. Since 85% of the population is white, it seems reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being black is relatively low, so we can assume P(H) < 0.15. Plugging in different values for P(H) in the equation above, we find that P(H|E) increases as P(H) decreases, reaching a maximum of approximately 0.75 when P(H) = 0.05.

So, based on this analysis, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 (75%). However, this is just an estimation based on the given information and assumptions, and the actual probability may be different.
