To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness's statement that the attacker is black
- P(H|E) is the probability we are trying to estimate
- P(E|H) is the reliability of the witness's racial identification, which is given as 0.8
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is what we want to find
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making a statement that the attacker is black, which is not given in the information

However, we can calculate P(E) by using the information about the city's population:
- P(E) = P(attacker is black) * reliability of witness + P(attacker is white) * (1 - reliability of witness)
- P(E) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
- P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
- P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.241

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.241 or 24.1%.
