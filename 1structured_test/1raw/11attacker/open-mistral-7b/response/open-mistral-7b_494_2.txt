Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (with a 20% error rate).
2) The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the error rate is 20%, P(B|~A) = 0.2.
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is given as 1-P(A) = 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(A|B) of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.034]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.154 â‰ˆ 0.77

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 77%.
