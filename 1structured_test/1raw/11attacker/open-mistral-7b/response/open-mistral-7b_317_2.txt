Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's description of the attacker being black was made under conditions where the witness could not see the attacker's race clearly. This means that the witness's ability to correctly identify race in this specific situation may not be the same as their general ability (which we have from the first piece of information).

Without more information about how this witness's ability to identify race under low-visibility conditions compares to their general ability, it is not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. Therefore, I would recommend conducting further investigation to gather additional information before making a definitive probability estimate.

Strictly in the dictionary format:
{probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1 due to insufficient information}
