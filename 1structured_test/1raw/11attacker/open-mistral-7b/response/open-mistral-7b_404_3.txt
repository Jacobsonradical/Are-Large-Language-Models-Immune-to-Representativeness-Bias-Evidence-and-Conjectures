To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is only 80% accurate, and they err 20% of the time.

If we assume that the witness is making a random guess when they are unable to see the attacker's race, the probability of them incorrectly identifying the attacker as black would be the same as their overall error rate, which is 20%.

However, since the witness actually identified the attacker as black, we can't simply assume they made a random guess. Instead, we need to account for the possibility that they were correct.

The probability of the witness being correct in identifying the attacker as black is equal to their accuracy rate when they can see a person's race, which is 80%.

Since we don't know if the witness saw the attacker's race or not, we can't directly use their accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

The prior probability of event A is the racial composition of the city, which is 15%. The probability of event B given event A is the accuracy rate of the witness, which is 80%. The probability of event B is the sum of the probability of event A and the probability of event A's complement (the attacker is white), times the error rate of the witness for event A's complement.

Since the error rate for event A's complement is 20%, and the prior probability of event A is 15%, the probability of event B is (15% * 80%) + (85% * 20%) = 12.6% + 17% = 29.6%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of event A given event B as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.296 â‰ˆ 0.26

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.26, or 26%. This means that, given the information we have, there is a 26% chance that the attacker is black.

Note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is unaffected by whether they can see the person's face or not. If this is not the case, our estimate may be off.
