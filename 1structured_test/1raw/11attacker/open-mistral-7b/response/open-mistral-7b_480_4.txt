Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to judge a person's race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case:
- A is the attacker being black
- B is the witness's identification of a black person

1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Since the witness is 80% accurate, this is 0.8.
2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given the city's population distribution, this is 0.15 (15%).
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black. Since the witness is half the time correct and half the time incorrect, and there are equal numbers of white and black people, the probability of selecting a black person is 0.5 (half of the time).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5
= 0.24

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.24 or 24%.
