Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to correctly identify race was 80% and the error rate was 20%.

Given that the witness made an error in this case, we cannot assume that the witness's identification is necessarily incorrect. Instead, we should consider the possibility that the witness was correct and the attacker is actually black, as well as the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness making an error in this case is the error rate, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black in the population, plus the probability of the witness making an error multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white in the population.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = P(Witness correctly identifies black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness incorrectly identifies black) * P(Attacker is white)

We are given that P(Witness correctly identifies black) = 0.8 and P(Witness incorrectly identifies black) = 0.2. We are also given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(Attacker is white) = 0.85 and P(Attacker is black) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.29 or 29%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's identification and the racial composition of the population.
