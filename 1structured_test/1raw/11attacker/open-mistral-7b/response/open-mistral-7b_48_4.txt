Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% probability of correctly identifying the race of a person and a 20% probability of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and we assume that their identification is either correct or incorrect, we can use the probability of their error as an estimate of the probability that they made a mistake in this case.

The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability that they made a correct identification is 100% - 20% = 80%. However, we know that 85% of the population is white, so it's more likely that the witness made a mistake and identified a white person as black than that they correctly identified a black person.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 0.8 or 80%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case. In reality, the probability that the attacker is black might be lower than 80% due to the higher proportion of white people in the population. Without more information, it's impossible to provide a more precise estimate.

{probability: 0.8, caution: The estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case.}
