Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black,
- W as the event that the witness is present, and
- R as the event that the witness correctly identifies a person's race.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(W) = 1 (the witness was present, we assume this is a certainty)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (complementary probability)
- P(B | A and W) = 1 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B | ~A and W) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
- P(R | A and W) = 1 (the witness correctly identifies race 100% of the time, given that the attacker is black)
- P(R | ~A and W) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, given that the attacker is not black)

Now, we can calculate P(A | B):

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / [P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ~A) * P(~A)]

Calculating the values:
P(B | A) * P(A) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15
P(B | ~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ~A) * P(~A) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, P(A | B) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

In decimal form, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.47.
