Given the two pieces of information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

1. From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. From the second piece of information, we know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% under similar conditions. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify the race 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. Given this, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification.
4. If we assume that the witness made an error, it means they incorrectly identified the attacker as black. Since the witness misidentifies race 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is white, given the witness's report.
5. However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white. If the witness indeed made an error, it's more likely that they mistakenly identified a white person as black, rather than the other way around.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report and the racial distribution in the city, is likely lower than 15%.
7. To estimate this probability, we can consider the ratio of the actual white population (85%) to the combined probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being black (which we assume to be equal to the actual black population, 15%).
8. This ratio gives us an estimate of the probability that the witness was correct in their identification, which is approximately 0.35 (or 35%).

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.35}. This estimate assumes that the witness made an error in their identification and that it's more likely that they mistakenly identified a white person as black, given the racial distribution in the city. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and the actual probability might be different.
