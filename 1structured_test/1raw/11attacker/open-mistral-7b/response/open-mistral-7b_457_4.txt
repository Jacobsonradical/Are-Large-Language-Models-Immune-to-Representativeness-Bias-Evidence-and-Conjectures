Given the information provided, the probability estimate of the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. The overall population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and their error rate is 20%.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (probability 0.8).
   b) The witness made an error (probability 0.2).
4. In scenario a, the attacker is actually black (probability 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12).
5. In scenario b, the attacker could be either white or black (probability 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).
6. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being black is the sum of probabilities in scenarios a and b: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29}.
