Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (the proportion of black attackers in the city) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white (since the witness identifies half white and half black people correctly, and makes errors 20% of the time, this probability is equal to the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is also 0.2)
- P(B|W) as the probability of an attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black (the probability we are trying to find)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1-0.15)]

Calculating this, we find that the probability of the attacker being black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
