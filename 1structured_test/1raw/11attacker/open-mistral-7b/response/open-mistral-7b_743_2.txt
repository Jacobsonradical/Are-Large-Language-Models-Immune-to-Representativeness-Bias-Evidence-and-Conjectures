Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification of attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's reliability)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of attacker being black in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (irrelevant in this case, as we're only interested in the ratio)

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of black population)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's reliability in identifying black people)

To find P(E|H), we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases when presented with a half-white, half-black sample. Since the attacker is black, the witness is correct in identifying the attacker's race 80% of the time.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / P(E)
= 0.12 / P(E)

Since P(E) is not provided, we cannot give a specific value for P(H|E). However, we can see that P(H|E) is directly proportional to P(E), which is the probability of the evidence, which is the witness's reliability in identifying race. Since the witness is relatively reliable (80% correct), the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is likely to be relatively high as well.

In conclusion, while we cannot provide a specific number without knowing P(E), we can say that based on the witness's identification and the witness's reliability, it is likely that the attacker is black. The exact probability would depend on the specific value of P(E).
