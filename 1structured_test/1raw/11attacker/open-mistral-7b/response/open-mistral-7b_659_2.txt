Given the information provided, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so the prior probability is 0.15.

However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time, but they also err 20% of the time. When the witness identifies the attacker as black, there are two possibilities: the attacker is actually black (a true positive), or the witness is mistaken (a false positive).

The probability of a false positive is the probability of the witness erring multiplied by the prior probability of the attacker being white. So, P(false positive) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of a true positive is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, which is 0.8, multiplied by the prior probability of the attacker being black. So, P(true positive) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the product of the probability of a true positive and the prior probability divided by the sum of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false positive.

So, the posterior probability is (0.12 * 0.15) / (0.12 * 0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.517.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.517 or 51.7%.
