To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's error rate is 20%, meaning they incorrectly identify a person's race 20% of the time.
2. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.

Since the witness couldn't see the attacker's race and made an incorrect identification, the probability that the witness's mistake was attributable to misidentifying a white person as black is 20%.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is the complement of the error rate, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, we need to adjust this probability to account for the racial demographics of the city. Since there are more white people in the city, it's more likely that the witness would make a mistake by identifying a white person as black than by correctly identifying a black person.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black given the city's demographics.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B). Then, we have:

P(B) = P(Witness correctly identified attacker as black) * P(Attacker is black | Witness's racial demographics)

The first term is 0.80 (from above).

The second term is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15.

So, P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and not a definitive result. The actual probability could be different due to factors not accounted for in this analysis.
