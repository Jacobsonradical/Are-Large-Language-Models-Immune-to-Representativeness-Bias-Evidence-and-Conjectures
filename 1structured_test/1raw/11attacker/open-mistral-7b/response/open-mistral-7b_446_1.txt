Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (0.8) and makes errors 20% (0.2) of the time. If we assume that the probability of the attacker being black is P, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as white is 1 - P.

The witness saw the attacker at night and under less than ideal conditions, so we can assume that the probability of their error is higher than their usual 20%. Let's say the error probability in this specific case is 30% (0.3).

We can set up an equation to represent this information:

0.8 * P + 0.3 * (1 - P) = 0.2 (witness's stated error rate)

Solving this equation for P, we get:

P = 0.3333 (approximately 33.33%)

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 33.33%.
