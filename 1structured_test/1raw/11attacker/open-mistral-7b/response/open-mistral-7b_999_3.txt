Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E), where P(H|E) is the probability we're interested in, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

First, let's calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. Since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability of correct identification).

Next, let's calculate P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(E), the probability of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black) regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this means they correctly identify race 80% of the time, including both whites and blacks. So, P(E|not H) = 0.8 (the probability of correct identification for a non-black attacker), and P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.32 + 0.68 = 0.104.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.104 â‰ˆ 0.134.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.134 or 13.4%.
