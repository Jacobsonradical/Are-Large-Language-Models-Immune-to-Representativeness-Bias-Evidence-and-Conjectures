Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the error rate is equally distributed between incorrectly identifying a black person as white and vice versa, then the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a black person as black is 20%/2 = 10%.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, we want to find P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification), which we'll denote as P(black|witness).

We know P(witness|black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time) and P(witness|not black) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies black people as not black 10% of the time).

We also know that P(black) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black) and P(not black) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(black|witness) = (P(witness|black) * P(black)) / (P(witness|black) * P(black) + P(witness|not black) * P(not black))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(black|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.37 or 37%.

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.37.
