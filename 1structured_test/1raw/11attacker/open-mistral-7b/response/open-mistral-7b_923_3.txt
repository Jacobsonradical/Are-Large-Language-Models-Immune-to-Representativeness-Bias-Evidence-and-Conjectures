To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to account for the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The witness's observed error rate is 20%, so the probability of making a correct identification is 80%. In other words, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is P(black|witness_correct) = 0.8, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is P(white|witness_incorrect) = 0.2.

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black given the witness's identification is P(black|witness_identified) = P(witness_correct|black) * P(black) / (P(witness_correct|black) * P(black) + P(witness_incorrect|black) * P(white)).

Using the given information, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(black|witness_identified) = (0.8 * P(black)) / ((0.8 * P(black)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(black))))

We also know the racial composition of the city's population, which is 85% white and 15% black. Therefore, P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.

Plugging the values into the equation, we get:

P(black|witness_identified) â‰ˆ (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.23 or 23%.
