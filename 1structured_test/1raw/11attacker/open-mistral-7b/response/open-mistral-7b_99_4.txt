Based on the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the fact that the attacker could not be seen due to the dark conditions. Therefore, the witness's statement about the attacker's race is not reliable in this case.

Since we cannot use the witness's statement, we must rely on the city's demographics. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15%, which can be represented as:

{probability: 0.15}
