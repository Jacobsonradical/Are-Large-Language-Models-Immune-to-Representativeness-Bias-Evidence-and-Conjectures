To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, we don't have enough information about how often they make false positives (identifying a white person as black) versus false negatives (failing to identify a black person as such).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black. However, since the witness's identification is not 100% reliable, we need to adjust this prior probability based on the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black as P(witness error | attacker is white).

We know that P(witness error | attacker is white) = 0.2 (from the information given).

Also, we know that P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the racial composition of the city) and P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as such is 1 - P(witness error | attacker is black) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is P(witness statement | attacker is black) = 0.8.

Similarly, the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is P(witness statement | attacker is white) = P(witness error | attacker is white) = 0.2.

We want to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, denoted as P(attacker is black | witness statement).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(attacker is black | witness statement) = [P(witness statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness statement | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This is lower than the prior probability of 15%, suggesting that the witness's identification may have introduced some uncertainty. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say whether the witness was mistaken or if the attacker was actually less likely to be black than suggested by the city's demographics.
