To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. If we assume that the witness's error rate is uniform across all races, then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is equal to the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this means they are incorrect 20% of the time, or 0.2 times out of every 1.0.

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the expected number of black people that the witness would encounter in a sample of 1.0. This is done by multiplying the population proportion of black people by 1.0: 0.15.

Given that the witness makes an error 0.2 times out of every 1.0, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness will mistake a black person for a white person in a sample of 0.15. This is done by multiplying the error rate by the proportion of black people: 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

However, we are not given the actual sample size that the witness encountered. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the witness encountered a large enough sample to make this calculation meaningful. In this case, the probability that the witness's identification of a black attacker as such is a mistake is 0.03.

So, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 or 97%. This is a rough estimate, and the actual probability may be different depending on the sample size and other factors.
