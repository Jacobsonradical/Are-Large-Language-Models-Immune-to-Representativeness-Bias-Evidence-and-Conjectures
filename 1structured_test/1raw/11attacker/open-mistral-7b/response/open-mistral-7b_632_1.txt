Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

1. The city's demographic distribution of white and black populations is 85% and 15%, respectively.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% in favorable conditions, but errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's demographic distribution: P(A) = 0.15
2. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's accuracy rate of 80%: P(B|A) = 0.8
3. P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. This can be calculated as the complement of the witness's accuracy rate: P(B|~A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
4. P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is the complement of the city's demographic distribution: P(~A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
