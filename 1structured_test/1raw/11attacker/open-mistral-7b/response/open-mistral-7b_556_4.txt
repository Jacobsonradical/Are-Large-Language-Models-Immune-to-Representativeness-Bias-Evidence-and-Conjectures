To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem gives us the probability of an event A (in this case, the attacker being black) given the evidence E (the witness's statement about the attacker's race).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E)]

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. In this case, given the city's demographics, 15% of the population is black. So, P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(E|A) is the likelihood of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(E|A) = 0.8.

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement being true, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white). Calculating this gives us P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.34

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is around 0.34 or 34%.
