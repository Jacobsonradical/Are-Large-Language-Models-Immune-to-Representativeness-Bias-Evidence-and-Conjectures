Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black) and the witness's ability to correctly identify race under similar conditions (80% accuracy, 20% error).

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness could have made an error.

Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying race, it's likely that they correctly identified the attacker's race. But because we cannot be certain that the witness made the correct identification, we cannot use this information alone to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate between 0 and 1. This situation would require additional information or evidence to make a more accurate assessment.
