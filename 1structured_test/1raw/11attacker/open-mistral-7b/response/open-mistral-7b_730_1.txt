Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is black. In this case, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, we are correct. If the witness errs and identifies the attacker as white, we are wrong. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as white is 0.2 (20%). The total probability of this scenario being correct is then 0.8 * 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black) + 0.2 * 0.05 (the probability of the witness erring and still identifying the attacker as black).

2. The attacker is white. In this case, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, we are wrong. If the witness correctly identifies the attacker as white, we are correct. The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as white is 0.8 (80%). The total probability of this scenario being correct is then 0.2 * 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white) + 0.8 * 0.05 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as white despite him being black).

Now, we can compare the probabilities of the two scenarios to determine the most likely scenario. Since we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, we will choose the scenario with the higher total probability if it's greater than 0.5 (50%), and the lower total probability if it's less than 0.5.

Let's compute the probabilities:

Scenario 1: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.05 = 0.12 + 0.01 = 0.13
Scenario 2: 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.05 = 0.17 + 0.04 = 0.21

Since Scenario 2's total probability (0.21) is greater than 0.5, we can conclude that the most likely scenario is that the attacker is white, given the witness's testimony and the city's racial composition.

However, it's important to note that the witness's testimony may have been influenced by bias or other factors, and this analysis assumes that the witness's error rate is constant. In reality, this may not be the case, and other factors could have influenced the witness's identification.
