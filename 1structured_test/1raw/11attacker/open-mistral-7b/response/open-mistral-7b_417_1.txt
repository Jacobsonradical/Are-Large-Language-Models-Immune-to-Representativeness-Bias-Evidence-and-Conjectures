To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this error contributes to our overestimation of the actual probability.

To account for this, we should subtract the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a white person as black, which is the reverse error probability. The reverse error probability can be calculated as 1 - the probability of correctly identifying a white person, which is 0.8 (80%) in this case.

So, the reverse error probability is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making this specific error given the city's racial composition. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (the reverse error probability), multiplied by 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (the accuracy of the witness) multiplied by 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider the sum of the two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white attacker as black.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is:

0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a black attacker) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of witness erring and identifying a white attacker as black) = 0.12 + 0.017 = 0.137

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.7%.
