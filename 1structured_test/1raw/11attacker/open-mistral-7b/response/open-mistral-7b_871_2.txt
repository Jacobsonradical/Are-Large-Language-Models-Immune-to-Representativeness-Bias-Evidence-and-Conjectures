Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have enough information about the specific circumstances of the witness's identification of the attacker in this case.

Assuming that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the specific incident, we could make an estimate based on the city's racial demographics. If the city is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness's accuracy is 80%, then we would expect the witness to correctly identify a black attacker 12% of the time (0.15 * 0.8) and mistakenly identify a white attacker as black 8% of the time (0.85 * 0.2).

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. This means that either the witness was correct (12% chance), or they made an error (8% chance). Since we don't know which of these two possibilities is true, we cannot make a definitive probability estimate.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. The best we can say is that the probability that the attacker is black is either 12% or 8%, but we do not know which of these two probabilities is correct.
