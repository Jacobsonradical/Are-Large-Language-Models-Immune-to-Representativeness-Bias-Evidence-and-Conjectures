Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the demographic makeup of the city and the testimony of the witness.

1. Demographic evidence: The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This suggests that the attacker is likely to be white, given the majority population.

2. Witness testimony: The witness, who has an 80% success rate in identifying race, incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This suggests that the attacker might not actually be black, as the witness's error rate is 20%.

We cannot simply combine these two pieces of evidence directly, as they come from different sources with potentially different levels of reliability. Instead, we can think of the witness's testimony as an additional piece of evidence that slightly modifies our initial probability based on the demographics.

The witness's testimony suggests that the actual probability of the attacker being black may be lower than the 15% suggested by the demographics, but we don't have enough information to calculate an exact number. However, we can use the witness's error rate to make a rough estimate.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time when the actual person was white, we can assume that the witness would have incorrectly identified the attacker as white 20% of the time when the actual person was black. This means that when the actual person was black, the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time.

So, if the actual probability of the attacker being black is P, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 0.8P. Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 0.2 times when the actual person was white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.8 - 0.8P.

However, we know the relative proportions of whites and blacks in the city. The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, so we can write the equation 0.85 = 0.8 - 0.8P. Solving for P, we get P = 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875, or about 18.75%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is perfectly accurate when the person is actually black. In reality, the witness's accuracy is only 80%, so the actual probability of the attacker being black is likely lower than 18.75%.

In conclusion, based on the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is likely lower than 15% but higher than the witness's error rate of 20%. A strict answer in the requested format would be: {probability: less than 0.15 but greater than 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. However, this is a rough estimate and a more precise calculation would require more information.
