To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence.

The formula is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is black", and B is the event "the witness identified the attacker as black".

We are given the following information:
- P(A|B) is 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying race)
- P(B|A) is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
- P(A) is the probability we want to find (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the total population statistics and the witness's error rate:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate P(not A) as 0.85. So,

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.306

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.306 or 30.6%.
