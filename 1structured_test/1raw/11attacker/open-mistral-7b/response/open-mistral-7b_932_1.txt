To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 0.8 (correctly identifying the race 80% of the time), and the error rate is 0.2 (incorrectly identifying the race 20% of the time).

Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the actual number of white and black people in the city.

Let's assume there are 100 people in the city. Then, there are 85 white people and 15 black people.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we need to account for this error. If the witness identifies a white person as black (a type I error), we will incorrectly infer that the attacker is black.

The probability of a type I error is the probability of choosing a white person and incorrectly identifying them as black. This can be calculated as the number of white people divided by the total number of people, multiplied by the error rate:

P(type I error) = (number of white people) / (total number of people) * error rate
                            = 85 / 100 * 0.2
                            = 0.17

If the witness identifies a black person as white (a type II error), we will incorrectly infer that the attacker is white.

The probability of a type II error is the probability of choosing a black person and incorrectly identifying them as white. This can be calculated as the number of black people divided by the total number of people, multiplied by the error rate:

P(type II error) = (number of black people) / (total number of people) * error rate
                            = 15 / 100 * 0.2
                            = 0.03

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. This can be done by considering both types of errors:

P(attacker is black | witness testimony) = P(witness testifies black and attacker is black) / P(witness testifies black)

Let's denote P(attacker is black) as p. Then, the probability of the witness testifying black and the attacker being black is:

P(witness testifies black and attacker is black) = p * P(witness testifies black | attacker is black)

The probability of the witness testifying black is:

P(witness testifies black) = P(witness testifies black and attacker is black) + P(witness testifies black and attacker is white)

We know that the probability of a type I error is 0.17, so:

P(witness testifies black and attacker is white) = 0.17

Substituting these probabilities, we get:

P(witness testifies black) = p * P(witness testifies black | attacker is black) + 0.17

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(witness testifies black | attacker is black) = 0.8.

We can now solve for the probability that the attacker is black:

p = (P(witness testifies black) - 0.17) / 0.8

Substituting the values we have, we get:

p = (0.8 * 0.8 + 0.17) / 0.8

p = 0.6875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.6875 or 68.75%.
