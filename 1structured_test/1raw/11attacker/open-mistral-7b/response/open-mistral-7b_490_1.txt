Based on the provided information, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness saw the attacker in the dark and could not see the attacker's race clearly, so we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can assume that the witness's error rate is equally distributed between the two races (white and black) because we do not have enough information to know if the error rate is biased.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, and the population is 85% white and 15% black, the error rate for mistaking a black person for a white person would be:

20% error rate * 15% black population = 0.03 * 0.15 = 0.0045 or 0.45%

Similarly, the error rate for mistaking a white person for a black person would be:

20% error rate * 85% white population = 0.02 * 0.85 = 0.017 or 1.7%

Since we do not have enough information to determine if the error rate is biased, we can assume that both error rates are equal. This means that the witness is incorrect about the attacker's race 2.15% of the time (0.45% + 1.7%).

Since the attacker could be either black or white, the probability that the attacker is black is the ratio of the number of black people to the total number of people minus the probability of error.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

15% black population / (100% total population - 2.15% error rate) = 0.15 / (100 - 0.0215) = 0.15 / 97.97 = 0.00155 or 0.16%

However, given that the witness's ability to judge a person's race under dark conditions is not directly applicable to this situation, this estimation may not be reliable. It is recommended to gather more information or conduct further investigations to get a more accurate estimate.
