Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness saw the attacker at night and could not see their race clearly, so their judgment is not entirely reliable in this case.

Since we cannot be certain that the witness's error this time was due to the night conditions or simply a mistake, it's not appropriate to use their success rate directly. Instead, we can consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities.

1. The witness correctly identifies the attacker's race (probability: 0.8, based on their success rate).
2. The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race (probability: 0.2, based on their error rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the outcome 1 implies that the attacker is indeed black, while outcome 2 implies that the attacker is white (given that 85% of the population is white).

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is therefore the probability of outcome 1:

{probability: 0.8}
