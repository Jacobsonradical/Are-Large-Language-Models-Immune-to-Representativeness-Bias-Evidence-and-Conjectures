To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness was correct in identifying race 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can assume that the witness's identification is a random event with a probability of 0.8 for being correct and 0.2 for being incorrect.

Given the racial composition of the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This means that if the attacker were white, the witness would have a 0.85 chance of identifying the attacker correctly, and if the attacker were black, the witness would have a 0.15 chance of identifying the attacker correctly.

Since the witness's identification is a random event, we can model the probability of the witness's identification matching the attacker's race as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct given that the attacker is white and the witness being correct given that the attacker is black.

Let P(attacker is black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(witness is correct) be the probability that the witness's identification matches the attacker's race.

Then, P(witness is correct) = 0.85 \* P(attacker is white) + 0.15 \* P(attacker is black)

Since we are given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we know that P(witness is correct) = 0.1 (given the witness's 80% accuracy rate).

We can now solve for P(attacker is black) by rearranging the equation:

0.1 = 0.85 \* P(attacker is white) + 0.15 \* P(attacker is black)

0.1 = 0.15 \* P(attacker is black)

P(attacker is black) = 0.1 / 0.15 = 0.666667

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66.67%.
