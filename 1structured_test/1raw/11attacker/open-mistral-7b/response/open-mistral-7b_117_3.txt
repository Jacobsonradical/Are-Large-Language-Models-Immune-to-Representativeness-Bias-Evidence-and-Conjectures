The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness, who is not perfectly reliable, has identified the attacker as black. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and the probability of error is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's statement is P(white|black witness) = 20%.

From the prior information, we know that the probability of the attacker being black in the population is P(black). Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute P(black|black witness):

P(black|black witness) = P(black witness|black) * P(black) / P(black witness)

Since the witness is incorrect with a probability of 20%, the probability of a black person being incorrectly identified as white by the witness is P(black witness|black) = 0.20.

The prior probability of a black person in the population is P(black) = 0.15. From the given information, we do not have enough information to compute P(black witness). However, we can rewrite the Bayes' theorem equation as:

P(black|black witness) = 0.20 * 0.15 / P(black witness)

The equation above shows that P(black|black witness) is proportional to the product of P(black) and P(black witness|black). Since both P(black) and P(black witness|black) are known, we can infer that the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is smaller than 0.15 (the prior probability of a black person in the population).

However, without a specific value for P(black witness), we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for P(black|black witness). Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
