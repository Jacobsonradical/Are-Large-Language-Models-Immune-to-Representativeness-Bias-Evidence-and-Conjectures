To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the population.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, and the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% when presented with equal numbers of white and black individuals, we can calculate the expected number of correct identifications given the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as p. Then, the probability of the attacker being white is 1 - p.

The witness will correctly identify the attacker as black if the attacker is actually black and the witness makes a correct identification (which happens with probability 0.8). The witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black if the attacker is white and the witness makes an error (which happens with probability 0.2 * (1 - p)).

So, the expected number of correct identifications of the attacker as black is 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p) * (1 - p).

The witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black if the attacker is actually white and the witness makes a correct identification (which happens with probability 0.2 * p). The witness will correctly identify the attacker as white if the attacker is actually white and the witness makes a correct identification (which happens with probability 0.8 * (1 - p)).

So, the expected number of incorrect identifications of the attacker as black is 0.2 * p + 0.8 * (1 - p) * p.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the observed number of correct identifications of the attacker as black is 1. The observed number of incorrect identifications of the attacker as black is 0.

We can now set up an equation to solve for p:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p) * (1 - p) = 1

Solving this equation numerically, we find that p â‰ˆ 0.68.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
