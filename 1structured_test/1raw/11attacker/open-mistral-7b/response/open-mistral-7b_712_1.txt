The information provided consists of two parts: the racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. This means the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Given this, the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is 0.20 (20%), and the probability of correctly identifying a white person is 0.80 (80%). Similarly, the probability of mistaking a black person for a white person is also 0.20 (20%), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.80 (80%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can now compute the probability of this event given the witness's reliability and the actual racial demographics.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.80. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.20. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of a random white person in the city being incorrectly identified as black by the witness is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

So, the probability of the event "the witness correctly identifies the black attacker" is 0.80 - 0.17 = 0.63 (63%).

Given these probabilities, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker is black, considering both the prior probability and the Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black) = P(Witness identifies attacker as black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / (P(Witness identifies attacker as black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness identifies attacker as black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White))

Substituting the values:

P(Attacker is Black) = 0.63 * 0.15 / (0.63 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) = 0.11 (11%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.11 (11%). This value takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.
