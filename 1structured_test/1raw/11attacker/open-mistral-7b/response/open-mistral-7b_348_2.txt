Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black by considering the reliability of the witness's race identification and the overall racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population in the city is white, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is white based on the witness's testimony:

P(attacker is white | witness's testimony) = proportion of white people in the city * proportion of correct race identifications by the witness
                                                               = 0.85 * 0.8
                                                               = 0.68

This means that the witness's testimony suggests that there is a 68% chance that the attacker is white. However, we also know that the witness errs 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify the race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race is actually unknown, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the witness's testimony is incorrect:

P(witness's testimony is incorrect) = 0.2

Since the witness's testimony suggests that the attacker is white with a probability of 0.68, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's testimony:

P(attacker is black | witness's testimony) = 1 - P(attacker is white | witness's testimony) * P(witness's testimony is correct)
                                                                     = 1 - 0.68 * (1 - 0.2)
                                                                     = 0.16

This means that given the witness's testimony, we estimate that there is a 16% chance that the attacker is black. However, since we know that 15% of the population in the city is black, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can estimate a more conservative probability that the attacker is black without relying on the witness's testimony:
