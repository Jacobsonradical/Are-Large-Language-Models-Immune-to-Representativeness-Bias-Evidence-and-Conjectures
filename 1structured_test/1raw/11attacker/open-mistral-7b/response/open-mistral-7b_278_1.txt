Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
3. Since we don't have any other information about the likelihood of the witness's error in this specific case, we can assume that the probability of an error is constant, and the probability of an accurate identification is also constant.
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (correctly) is the same as the witness's accuracy rate (80%), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as white (incorrectly) is the same as the witness's error rate (20%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8} (80%).
