To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness makes a correct identification
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person (white in this case)

Given that the witness is 80% accurate, we can infer that P(W) = 0.8, P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|not B) = 0.2.

The city's racial composition is given as 85% white and 15% black. This means that the probability of the attacker being white is P(not B) = 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is P(B) = 0.15.

Since the witness did not see the attacker's face, there is no information that directly links the attacker's race to the witness's observation. However, we can still calculate the probability of the witness making the observed statement "A black person attacked me" given the attacker's race.

The probability of the witness making this statement if the attacker is black is P(statement|B) = P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness making this statement if the attacker is white is P(statement|not B) = P(W|not B) * P(not B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we cannot know for certain which of these two probabilities corresponds to the true situation, we can only calculate the probability of the witness making the statement given either possibility. This is called the likelihood ratio, which is given by the ratio of the two probabilities:

LR = P(statement|B) / P(statement|not B) = 0.12 / 0.17 ≈ 0.71

The likelihood ratio tells us how much more likely it is that the attacker is black than white, given the witness's statement. However, this does not directly give us the probability that the attacker is black.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|statement) = P(statement|B) * P(B) / [P(statement|B) * P(B) + P(statement|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(B|statement) ≈ (0.12 * 0.15) / [(0.12 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.11

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.11. This means that, based on the witness's statement and the city's racial composition, we estimate that there is a 11% chance that the attacker is black.
