To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

1. We know from the witness's ability that they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
2. In the population, 85% are white and 15% are black.

Given these probabilities, we can calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, even if the attacker was actually white, due to the witness's error rate. This probability is the error rate of 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's identification, can be calculated as the probability of the witness identifying a black person (0.15) multiplied by the probability that the witness is correct (0.8) plus the probability of the witness identifying a white person (0.85) multiplied by the probability of the witness's error (0.2).

Mathematically, this is:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = P(Witness identifies Black & Attacker is Black) + P(Witness identifies White & Attacker is Black) * P(Witness error)

= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Thus, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
