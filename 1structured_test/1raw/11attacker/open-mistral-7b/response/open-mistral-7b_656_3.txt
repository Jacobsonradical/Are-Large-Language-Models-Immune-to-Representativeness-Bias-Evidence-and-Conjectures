Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can consider the witness's identification as an error. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the population is white is higher.

So, the probability that the witness's identification is an error (the attacker is black) can be estimated as the error rate, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 (or 20%).
