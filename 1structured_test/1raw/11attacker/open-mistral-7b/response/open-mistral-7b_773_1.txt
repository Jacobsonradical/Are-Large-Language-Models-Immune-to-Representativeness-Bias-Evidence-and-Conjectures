To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally distributed between identifying whites as blacks and blacks as whites, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 - 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.8 - 0.1 = 0.7 or 70%.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is the ratio of black people to the total population. However, since we cannot be certain that the witness's mistake did not involve misidentifying the attacker, we need to adjust this probability by the reliability of the witness's identification.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.7 = 0.105 or 10.5%. This is a rough estimate and depends on several assumptions. In a real-world scenario, more detailed data and analysis would be required to make a more precise estimate.
