Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on evidence.

The formula is:

P(h | e) = [P(e | h) * P(h)] / [P(e)]

Where:
- P(h | e) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(e | h) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(h) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(e) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:
1. The evidence (e) is the witness's description of the attacker's race.
2. The hypothesis (h) is that the attacker is black.

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(e | h) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identified a black person)
- P(h) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black)
- P(e) = P(e | h) * P(h) + P(e | not h) * P(not h)
  P(e | not h) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identified a white person)
  P(not h) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is white)
  P(e) = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(h | e):

P(h | e) = [P(e | h) * P(h)] / P(e)
P(h | e) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.476

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.476 or 47.6%. This means that, based on this evidence and the witness's reliability, it is slightly more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, it's important to remember that this is just an estimate and other information or evidence could change the probability.
