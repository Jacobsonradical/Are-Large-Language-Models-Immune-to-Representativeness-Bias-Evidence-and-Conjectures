To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, let's call the probability of a random person being black p.

If the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, it will reduce the estimated probability of the attacker being black. This error will occur when the witness sees a white person but mistakes him/her for a black person. The probability of this happening is the proportion of white people in the city times the error rate of the witness.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is the proportion of black people in the city times the success rate of the witness.

So, we can write the equation as:

p = (success rate * proportion of black people) / (success rate * proportion of black people + error rate * proportion of white people)

p = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

p â‰ˆ 0.21

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.21 or 21%.
