Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E (P(H|E)) can be calculated as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H represents the attacker being black, and E represents the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that an attacker is black, given the city demographics)
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, where ~H represents the attacker being white)
4. P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that an attacker is white, given the city demographics)
5. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (total probability of the witness identifying someone as black)

We can calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
