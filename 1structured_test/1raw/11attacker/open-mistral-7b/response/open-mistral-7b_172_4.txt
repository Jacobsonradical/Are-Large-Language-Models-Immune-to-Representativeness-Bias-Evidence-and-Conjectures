To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying races, but they also make errors 20% of the time. However, we don't know if they made an error in this particular case. If they did, they would have mistakenly identified the attacker as black, which would imply that the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%). This means that there is a 12% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, if the witness did not make an error, then the attacker is indeed black. Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of a black person being correctly identified is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

However, since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we can't simply add these two probabilities to get the overall probability. Instead, we need to consider both possibilities and weight them according to their likelihood.

The likelihood of the witness making an error is 0.12, and the likelihood of the witness not making an error is 1 - 0.12 = 0.88.

So, the overall probability of the attacker being black is 0.88 * 0.12 (the probability of a black person being correctly identified, given that the witness did not make an error) + 0.12 * 0 = (0.12 * 0.8) + 0.12 * 0 = 0.096 (9.6%).

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case. If the witness is more likely to make errors in low-light conditions, or if the attacker was wearing clothing that made their race harder to discern, then the actual probability could be higher or lower. Without more information, it's impossible to say for certain.

{probability: 0.096, please note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant and does not account for any potential factors that may have affected their ability to accurately identify the attacker's race}
