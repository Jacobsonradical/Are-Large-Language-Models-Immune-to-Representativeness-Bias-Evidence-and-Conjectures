To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the population: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony as follows:

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (the witness's correct rate).
The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Since there are more white people than black people in the city, it's more likely that the witness is encountering white people and making errors in identifying them as black.

The probability that the witness is seeing a black person and correctly identifying them as black is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).
The probability that the witness is seeing a white person and incorrectly identifying them as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (85% of the population is white, and the witness errs 20% of the time).

To find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, we need to weigh the probabilities of these two scenarios:

(probability of witness seeing a black person and correctly identifying them) * (true probability of attacker being black)
+
(probability of witness seeing a white person and incorrectly identifying them as black) * (false probability of attacker being black)

(0.15 * 1)
+
(0.17 * 0)
= 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 15%.
