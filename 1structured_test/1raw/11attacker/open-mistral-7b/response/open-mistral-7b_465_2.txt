Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is notoriously incorrect in identifying race 20% of the time identified the attacker as black. This suggests that even if the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than 15%, the witness's error rate may have led to an overestimation.

To calculate an estimate, we can consider both the actual population distribution and the witness's error rate. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P (where 0 < P < 1).

We know that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time. Since the population is 15% black, the probability of a black person being correctly identified as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since the witness said the attacker was black, we can infer that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black or incorrectly identified a white person as black. The probability of the latter happening is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (either correctly or incorrectly) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Since the witness's statement suggests that the true probability P of the attacker being black is greater than 0.29, we can estimate P to be slightly higher than 0.29. However, without more information, we cannot provide a precise number.

In summary, {probability: approximately 0.29 to slightly higher, please interpret with caution due to the witness's error rate}
