To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time they encounter a white person.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the number of white people the witness encounters in a sample is approximately 85 times the number of black people. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this means that the number of times they correctly identify a white person as white is approximately 0.8 * 85.

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, which means they misidentify 0.2 * 85 black people as white. Since the attacker was misidentified as black by the witness, we can assume that they are one of these 0.2 * 85 misidentified black people.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the number of misidentified black people divided by the total number of black people in the sample. Since the total number of black people in the sample is 0.15 * 100 (assuming 100 people in the sample), the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2 * 85 / 15 = 0.293 or 29.3%.
