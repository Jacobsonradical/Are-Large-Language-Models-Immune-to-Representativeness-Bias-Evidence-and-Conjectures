Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately identify race is only 80% correct. This means that they err 20% of the time, which could potentially mean misidentifying a white person as black.

Given this, it's important to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability. Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time, we would expect that if the attacker was indeed white (which makes up 85% of the population), the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of the attacker being black in the population (15%) multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (0.8) plus the probability of the attacker being white (0.85) multiplied by the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (0.2).

This can be calculated as follows:

(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
