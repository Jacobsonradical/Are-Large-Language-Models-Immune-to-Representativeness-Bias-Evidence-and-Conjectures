Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population, where 85% are white and 15% are black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, where they correctly identify the race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.

However, the witness's mistaken identifications are not specified with regard to which race they incorrectly identified. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we would need to know if the witness's errors tend to favor one race over the other. Without this information, we cannot make a definitive estimate.

In the absence of this data, we can provide a conservative and liberal estimate based on the witness's overall accuracy.

1. Conservative estimate: Since the witness's errors are not known to favor one race over the other, we can assume that these errors are equally distributed between the two races. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be the same as their proportion in the population, which is 15%.

   {probability: 0.15}

2. Liberal estimate: If the witness's errors tend to favor the majority race (white in this case), then the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a black attacker as white would be higher than the 20% error rate. This would imply a lower probability that the attacker is black. However, without knowing the direction of the witness's bias, we cannot quantify this effect.

   As a result, we cannot provide a specific probability for this liberal estimate. It would depend on the unknown bias of the witness, which is not given in the information provided.
