Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is the proportion of blacks in the city, which is given as 15%. The probability of B given A (P(B|A)) is the accuracy of the witness in identifying blacks, which is given as 80%. The probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)) is the error rate of the witness in identifying blacks, which is given as 20%.

The probability of not A (P(not A)) is the proportion of whites in the city, which is given as 85%.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Now, we can substitute the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.182

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.66

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66%.
