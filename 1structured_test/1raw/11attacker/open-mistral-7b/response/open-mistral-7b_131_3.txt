Based on the information provided, the population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not always accurate in identifying race, has identified the attacker as black. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given that the witness is only correct in 80% of the cases, we can say that P(witness correct and attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

On the other hand, when the witness makes an error, they are more likely to misidentify a white person as black than the other way around, given the population distribution. So, if the witness is wrong, they are likely identifying a white person as black. Therefore, we can say that P(witness incorrect and attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness must be either correct or incorrect, we have P(witness correct) + P(witness incorrect) = 1. Therefore, we can calculate P(attacker is black) by adding the probabilities of the witness being correct and the attacker being black to the probability of the witness being incorrect and misidentifying a white person as black:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correct and attacker is black) + P(witness incorrect and attacker is white)
                          = 0.12 + 0.17
                          = 0.29

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
