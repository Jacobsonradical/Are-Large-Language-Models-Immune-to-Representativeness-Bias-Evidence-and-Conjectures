To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider two factors: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is only 80% under similar conditions. This means that, despite the racial composition of the city, we cannot simply assume that the attacker is white or black based on the witness's information alone, as the witness may have made an error.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability of this event occurring if the attacker was actually black. The probability of a correct identification is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of an error is 0.2 (20%), given a half-half racial distribution.

So, the probability of the witness accurately identifying a black attacker is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.5 (20% of the time erring * 50% chance of the attacker being white), which equals 0.1.

The total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker (either correctly or incorrectly) is 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9.

Since the actual attacker could be either black or white, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker among all possible attackers. Given that 15% of the city's population is black, this probability is 0.15 * 0.9 = 0.135 (13.5%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.135.
