To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H): The witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

Second, let's calculate P(H): Given that we have no prior information about the race of the attacker, we can assume that P(H) = P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Next, we calculate P(E): Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, we can assume that P(E) = P(attacker is white) * 0.2 + P(attacker is black) * 0.8 = 0.8 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.32.

Finally, we calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.32
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.273

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.273 or 27.3%.
