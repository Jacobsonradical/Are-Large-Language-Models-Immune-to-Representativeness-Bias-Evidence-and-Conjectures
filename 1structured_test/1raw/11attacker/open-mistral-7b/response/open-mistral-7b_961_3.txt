To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker not being black (before considering the evidence)

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
- P(H) = ? (the probability we want to estimate)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H)
- P(E) = P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|~H)*P(~H) (total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the actual population distribution)

We also know that 85% of the population is white, so P(~H) = 0.85. To find P(H), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H)*P(H) / P(E)

We know P(E|H) and P(~H), but we need to calculate P(E). We can do this by using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|~H)*P(~H)

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can solve for P(H):

P(H) = (P(E) - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

Substituting the given values for P(E) into the equation, we get:

P(H) = (P(E) - 0.17) / 0.8

Unfortunately, we don't have a value for P(E) yet. To find P(E), we need to know the proportion of black people in the population, which is not explicitly given in the information provided. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact probability that the attacker is black.

However, we can still make an educated guess based on the given information. Since the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and since the population is 85% white, it seems likely that the attacker is white. But without more specific data, we cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black.

In conclusion, while we cannot provide a numerical estimate, based on the given information it seems more likely that the attacker is white than black.
