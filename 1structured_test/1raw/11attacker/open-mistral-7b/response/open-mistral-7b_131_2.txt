Given the two pieces of information, we have a population that is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying races, with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. Let's assume the witness made an error in this case. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20%. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of choosing a white person randomly is also 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

On the other hand, if the attacker was indeed black, the witness correctly identified him. The probability of this happening is 0.8 (the accuracy rate) * 0.15 (the proportion of black people).

Since we don't know which case happened, we can add the probabilities of both scenarios to get an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is black: 0.17 (error) + 0.8 * 0.15 (correct) = 0.245, or 24.5%.

However, since the witness also identified the attacker as black, it seems more plausible that the attacker was indeed black. In this case, we can use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.

Both estimates suggest that there is a relatively high probability that the attacker is black, but they give slightly different numbers due to the uncertainty introduced by the witness's error rate. Therefore, as a final answer, we can provide a range of estimates: between 12% and 24.5%.
