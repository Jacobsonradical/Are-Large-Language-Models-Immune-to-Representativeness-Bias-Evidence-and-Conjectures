Based on the information provided, there are two sources of information to consider: the demographics of the city and the witness's reliability.

The demographic information suggests that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. However, this does not directly account for the witness's identification of the attacker as black, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race.

The witness's reliability is more relevant here. The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the times. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this a correct identification in 80% of the cases where the attacker actually is black, and an error in 20% of the cases where the attacker is actually white.

Given that the city is predominantly white, it's more likely that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error. To account for this, we can adjust the raw 80% probability given by the witness's reliability by the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85 (85%) according to the demographic information.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that, considering both the demographics of the city and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.16 or 16%.
