To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B (P(A|B)) is equal to the likelihood of the evidence given the event (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of the event (P(A)) divided by the probability of the evidence (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let's break this down:

1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Evidence B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black. This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) = Given that the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies him as black is 0.8 (from the first piece of information).
- P(B|~A) = Given that the attacker is not black (he's white), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies him as black is 0.2 (also from the first piece of information).
- P(A) + P(~A) = 1 (the attacker is either black or white)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We can rewrite P(B) as follows:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

We can solve for P(A) by rearranging the equation:

P(A) = (0.8 * P(A|B)) / 0.6

The city population statistics (second piece of information) can be used as a prior probability, P(A). According to it, 15% of the population is black. So:

P(A) = 0.15

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.6 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%.
