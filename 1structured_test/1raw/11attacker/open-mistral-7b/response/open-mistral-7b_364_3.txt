To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the attacker's race based on the new evidence from the witness.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person.

From the information given, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black)
4. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Now, we can compute the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.15
        = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 or 80%. This means that, based on the witness's testimony, it is eight times more likely that the attacker is black than not black. However, it's important to note that this is just a probability estimate, and actual events can deviate from expected probabilities due to randomness or other factors.
