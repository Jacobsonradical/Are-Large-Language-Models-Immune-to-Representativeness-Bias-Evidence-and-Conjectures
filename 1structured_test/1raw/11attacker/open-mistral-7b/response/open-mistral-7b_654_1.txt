Based on the information provided, the population proportion of blacks in the city is 15%, and the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% when the sample is half white and half black. However, the witness's statement that the attacker is black is an error because the victim could not see the attacker's race.

The witness's error rate is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's statement, is the error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since the probability of an event and its complementary event sum up to 1, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is the same in real-world scenarios as in the controlled sample. If the witness's ability to identify race is worse in real-world scenarios, then the probability that the attacker is black may be lower than 0.8.
