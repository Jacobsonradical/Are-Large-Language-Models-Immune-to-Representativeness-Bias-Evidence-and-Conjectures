To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not observed directly, we can consider the witness's incorrect identification as equally likely to be an error in identifying the attacker as white as an error in identifying the attacker as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies a person as black 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Since the total probability of all outcomes must add up to 1, the probability of correctly identifying a white person is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness's incorrect identification of a white person as black must have occurred. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.20.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
