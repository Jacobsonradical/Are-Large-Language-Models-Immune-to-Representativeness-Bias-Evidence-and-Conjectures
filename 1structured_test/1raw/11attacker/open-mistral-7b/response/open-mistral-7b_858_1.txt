Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts: the prior probability of the attacker being black, and the likelihood of the witness making a mistake given the attacker's race.

1. Prior probability: The attacker's race was not observed by the victim, so we must rely on the city's demographics. From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

2. Likelihood of witness error: The witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time. However, this information is not specific to black people. We don't know if the witness made more mistakes when identifying black people or white people. Without this information, we cannot adjust the error rate for the attacker's race.

Since we cannot calculate the likelihood of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black, we cannot use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability. Therefore, the best estimate we can provide is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (or 15%).
