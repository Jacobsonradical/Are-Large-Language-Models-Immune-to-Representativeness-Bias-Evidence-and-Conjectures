Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness's reliability in identifying race is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time but err 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. But we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. If the witness made an error, then the attacker is actually white.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that they identified the attacker as black:

1. The probability of the witness making an error is the error rate, which is 20%.
2. The probability of the witness not making an error is the correct rate, which is 80%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness did not make an error (i.e., the attacker is actually black) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%). This means that, based on the information given, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is black and a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.
