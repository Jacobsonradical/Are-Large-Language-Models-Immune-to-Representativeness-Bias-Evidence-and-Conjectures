Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the demographic distribution of the city's population and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The demographic distribution of the city's population suggests that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This is our prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race suggests that they are incorrect 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given both pieces of evidence, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

1. The witness's identification of the attacker as black is evidence that supports the hypothesis that the attacker is black. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error.

2. The probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white is 0.2 (given in the information).

3. The probability that the witness did not make an error and the attacker is black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

4. Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, the prior probability of the attacker being black should still be considered when interpreting the witness's evidence.

5. Therefore, the updated probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's evidence and the prior probability, is the product of the prior probability and the probability that the witness did not make an error, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is independent of the attacker's race. If this is not the case, the calculation may be incorrect.
