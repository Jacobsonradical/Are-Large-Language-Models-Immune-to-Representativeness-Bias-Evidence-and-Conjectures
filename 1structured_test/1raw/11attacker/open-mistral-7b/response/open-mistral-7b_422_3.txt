To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the two pieces of information given.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This is the population distribution, but it does not necessarily reflect the distribution of the attacker's race given the witness's error rate.

Second, we have information about the witness's ability to judge a person's race. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but makes an error 20% of the time. However, since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we cannot directly use this information to increase our confidence in the attacker's race being black. Instead, we should use this information to adjust our estimate of the population distribution.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is actually white. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 20%. If we consider the 15% of the population that is black, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, then the probability that a black person is mistakenly identified as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3%.

On the other hand, if the attacker's race is actually black, then the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 80%. In this case, if we consider the 85% of the population that is white, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, then the probability that a white person is mistakenly identified as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we should adjust our estimate of the population distribution based on the likelihood of a witness error. In other words, we should increase our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black by the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black, and decrease our estimate of the probability that the attacker is white by the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white.

So, the adjusted probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (original probability) + 0.17 (probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black) - 0.03 (probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white) = 0.25, or 25%.

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.25, or 25%.
