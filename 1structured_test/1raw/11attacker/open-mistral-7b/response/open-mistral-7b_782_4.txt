Based on the provided information, we have a witness who identifies races with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%. If we assume that the witness made an error in this case, then it's more likely that the attacker is from the majority race, which is white (85% of the population).

However, we cannot ignore the possibility that the witness was correct. Therefore, we need to factor both scenarios into our calculation.

Let's denote P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black and P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white.

We have two pieces of information:
1. Witness's statement: P(black) + P(witness error) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time)
2. City demographics: 0.85P(black) + 0.15P(white) = 1 (since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)

We can simplify the second equation to P(black) = 0.5 / (0.85 + 0.15 * P(black))

We don't have a direct way to solve for P(black) from this equation. However, since the witness made an error in this case, it's more likely that the attacker is white. Therefore, we will consider the following two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Witness made an error
In this case, P(black) = 0 and P(white) = 1. The probability that the witness made an error is 20%. So the probability of this scenario is 0.2 * 0 = 0.0 (since the probability of an event and its complement add up to 1)

Scenario 2: Witness was correct
In this case, P(black) = 0.15 and P(white) = 0.85. The probability of this scenario is 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

Since Scenario 1 is less likely, we will use Scenario 2's probability as our estimate.
