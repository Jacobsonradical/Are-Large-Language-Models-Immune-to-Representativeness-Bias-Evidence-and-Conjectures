Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability (before the witness's testimony) is that the attacker is black, given the racial demographics of the city. The likelihood is the probability that the witness would misidentify a white person as black, given that the attacker is indeed white. Conversely, the reverse likelihood is the probability that the witness would correctly identify a black person as black, given that the attacker is indeed black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(B|not A) is the likelihood of B given not A (the probability that the witness would misidentify a white person as black)
- P(not A) is the prior probability of not A (the probability that the attacker is white)

Let's calculate the probabilities:
1. Prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A) = 15% (from information a)
2. Prior probability of the attacker being white, P(not A) = 85% (from information a)
3. Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, P(B|A) = 80% (from information b)
4. Likelihood of the witness misidentifying a white person as black, P(B|not A) = 20% (from information b)

Now, let's plug these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculate the probabilities:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

Calculate the sum:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

Now, divide:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
