Based on the information provided, we can make an estimate using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker correctly given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the information given, we can calculate:
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (since P(H) + P(~H) = 1)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

This simplifies to:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.22

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.545.

Therefore, {probability: 0.545}
