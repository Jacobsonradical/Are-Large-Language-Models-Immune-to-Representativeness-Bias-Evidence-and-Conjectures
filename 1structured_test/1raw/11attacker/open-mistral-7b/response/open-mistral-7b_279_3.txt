Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. If the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that they were correct (80% chance), and a 0.2 probability that they were wrong (20% chance).

However, we also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If the witness was wrong, they would more likely have identified the attacker as white due to the larger proportion of white people in the city.

So, the probability that the witness was correct and the attacker is black is 0.8 (probability of correct identification), and the probability that the witness was wrong and the attacker is black is 0 (since the witness would have identified the attacker as white in this case).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness was correct times the probability of the attacker being black if the witness was correct, plus the probability that the witness was wrong times the probability of the attacker being black if the witness was wrong, divided by the total probability:

(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0) = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
