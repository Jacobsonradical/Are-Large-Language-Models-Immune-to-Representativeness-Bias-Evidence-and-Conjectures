Based on the information provided, the attacker being identified as black by the witness does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80%, meaning they make errors 20% of the time.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can infer that there are more white people in the city. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker is white. However, without knowing the exact number of times the witness made correct and incorrect identifications, we cannot calculate an exact probability.

But to provide an approximation, let's consider a simple scenario where the witness saw 100 people and correctly identified race 80 times. In this case, they would have incorrectly identified 20 people. If the attacker was white, the witness would have made a mistake in identifying them as black 20% of the time (given the witness's error rate). Since there are more white people in the city, it's likely that the witness made a mistake in identifying the attacker as black more often than not.

However, without knowing the exact number of times the witness made correct and incorrect identifications, a precise calculation is not possible. So, while it's more likely that the attacker is white, based on the witness's error rate, the probability cannot be strictly quantified.

{probability: less than 80%, more than 50%}
