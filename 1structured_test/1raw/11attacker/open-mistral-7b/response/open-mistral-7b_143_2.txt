The information provided suggests that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness, whose ability to accurately identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, reported seeing a black attacker.

Given this information, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the population statistics alone. The witness's report introduces a degree of uncertainty.

However, we can use the witness's reliability to make an estimate. If the witness's report is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. If the witness's report is incorrect, then the attacker is likely white (given the city's demographics).

Let's assume there is a 0.8 probability that the witness's report is correct, and a 0.2 probability that it is incorrect. If the report is correct, then the probability that the attacker is black is 1. If the report is incorrect, then the probability that the attacker is black is given by the city's demographics (the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is black).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83.

Therefore, based on the witness's report and the city's demographics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
