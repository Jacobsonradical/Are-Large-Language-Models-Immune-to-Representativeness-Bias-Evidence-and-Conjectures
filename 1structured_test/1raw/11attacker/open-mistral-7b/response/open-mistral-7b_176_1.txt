To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given and make some assumptions where necessary.

Assumption 1: The witness's error rate is independent of the attacker's race, meaning the 20% error rate applies to both black and white people.

Assumption 2: The witness is equally likely to encounter black or white people in their daily life, which is not explicitly stated but can be assumed given the city's population statistics (assumption b).

Given these assumptions, let's calculate the probability:

The witness identifies a person as black with probability 0.8 (based on the 80% correct rate) and as white with probability 0.2 (based on the 20% error rate).

However, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black (assumption b). This means that if the witness encounters a random person in the city, the probability of that person being black is 0.15, and the probability of them being white is 0.85.

Given these probabilities, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black:

P(black and correctly identified) = P(black) * P(correctly identified|black)
                                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                       = 0.12

Now, we can find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white:

P(black and incorrectly identified) = P(black) * P(incorrectly identified|black)
                                                          = 0.15 * 0.2
                                                          = 0.03

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is:

P(white and incorrectly identified) = P(white) * P(incorrectly identified|white)
                                                          = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                          = 0.17

Now, we know that the attacker was identified as black by the witness. The probability of this happening if the attacker is black is P(black and correctly identified) + P(black and incorrectly identified). Similarly, the probability of this happening if the attacker is white is P(white and incorrectly identified).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the ratio of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.03 / 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.771, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
