Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfectly accurate in identifying race reported seeing a black attacker. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness's error this time was misidentifying a white person as black or a black person as white, we cannot simply subtract the witness's error rate from the population percentages. Instead, we need to consider both possible scenarios and weight them by the likelihood of each.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the witness made an error (misidentifying a white person as black).

Given the witness's accuracy, we know P(W) = 0.2 (the error rate).

Also, we know that P(B) + P(W) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities).

Now, let's consider the two scenarios:

1) The attacker is black (B): The witness correctly identifies the attacker's race, so the probability of this scenario is P(B).

2) The attacker is white (W): The witness errs and identifies a white person as black. Given that the population is 85% white, the probability of this scenario is 0.85 * P(W) (the witness mistakes a white person).

Given the witness's statement, we know that the probability of the second scenario is less than the first, so we can write: P(B) > 0.85 * P(W).

Since we know P(W) = 0.2, we can write: P(B) > 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

However, we cannot determine the exact value of P(B) with the given information. The best we can do is provide an upper bound for P(B) based on the witness's statement.

Therefore, the probability estimate, considering the witness's statement, would be: {probability: 1.0, please note that this is an upper bound, and the true probability is likely lower}
