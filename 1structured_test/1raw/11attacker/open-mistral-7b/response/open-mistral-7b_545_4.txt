To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, and the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness's identification is likely to be influenced by bias, we should adjust the raw statistics to account for the witness's error rate.

Let's assume that the witness identified "black" when observing a random person from the city. Given that 85% of the population is white, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the actual proportion of black people in the city that the witness correctly identifies is:

100% - 20% * 85% = 91.6%

The witness also correctly identifies black people 80% of the time. Therefore, the actual proportion of black attackers that the witness correctly identifies is:

80% * 15% = 12%

The witness's identification of the attacker as black has a probability of 12% given the city's racial composition and the witness's error rate.

{probability: 0.12}
