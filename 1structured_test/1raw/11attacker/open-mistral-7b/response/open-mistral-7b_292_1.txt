To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means the witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time. Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is the witness's accuracy rate (0.8) multiplied by the proportion of black people in the city (0.15).
   This equals 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

2. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is also 0.2.

3. The number of white people in the city is 85%, so the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black and the probabilities of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.
   This equals 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 (or 29%).
