Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

The witness identified the attacker as black, but we know that the victim could not see the attacker's race. However, the witness's statement is our only piece of evidence.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case:
- A is the attacker being black
- B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black

First, let's calculate P(B|A):
- The witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate P(A):
- According to the demographics, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15

Finally, we need to calculate P(B):
- Since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time, when the attacker is actually white, P(B) = 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.24

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.54167

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.54 or 54%. However, keep in mind that this is only an estimate based on the given information, and the actual probability may be different.
