To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

When the witness makes an error, they are more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black than vice versa, given the city's racial demographics. Therefore, we can assume that out of the 20% of the time the witness errs, they are incorrectly identifying white people as black more often than black people as white.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(Black).

According to the witness, the attacker is black with probability 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time). However, due to the witness's error rate, we should adjust this probability to account for the possibility that the witness was mistaken.

Let's assume that the witness errs 25% of the time by incorrectly identifying white people as black. This would mean that out of the 15% of the population that is black, the witness identifies 12% (0.8 * 0.15) as black with certainty, and 3% (0.2 * 0.15) as black due to error.

Similarly, out of the 85% of the population that is white, the witness identifies 70% (0.8 * 0.85) as white with certainty and 25% (0.2 * 0.85) as white due to error.

The total percentage of the population the witness identifies as black, including both certain and erroneous identifications, is 12% + 3% = 15%. Since the actual percentage of the population that is black is 15%, we can conclude that the witness's error rate does not affect the overall probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the city's racial demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is P(Black) = 0.15 (the actual population percentage of blacks).
