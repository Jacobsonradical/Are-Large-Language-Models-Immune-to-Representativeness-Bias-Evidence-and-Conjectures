Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we cannot directly apply this to the attacker's case because the witness misidentified the attacker as black. This implies that the witness made an error in this specific case.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can assume that the witness's error rate is symmetrical, meaning that they make just as many mistakes identifying a white person as a black person. If this is the case, then the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a white person as black is also 20%.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. However, we know that the witness made an error, so we need to adjust these probabilities.

Since the witness made an error and identified the attacker as black, the true probability of the attacker being black is higher than 0.15. But we cannot say exactly how much higher without more information. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in the format you requested.

In conclusion, while we know that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate without additional information.
