To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the general population composition and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W) as the probability that the witness makes a correct identification (the attacker is indeed black).
- P(W^c) as the probability that the witness makes an error (the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakes him/her for black).

We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black (P(B) + P(W^c) = 0.15), and the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (P(W) = 0.8, P(W^c) = 0.2).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the attacker must either be genuinely black (P(B)) or be mistakenly identified as black (P(W^c)). The probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is P(B), and the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is P(W^c).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation:
P(B) + P(W^c) = P(B | W)

We are given the values for P(B), P(W), and P(W^c), so we can solve for P(B | W):

P(B | W) = P(B) + P(W^c) = 0.15

Since we are looking for an estimate of P(B), we can use the given values to calculate P(B | W) directly.
