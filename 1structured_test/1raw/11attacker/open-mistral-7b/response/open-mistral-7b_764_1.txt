To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually white (given the witness's error rate).

However, we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. This means that the probability of a random person being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

Given that the witness made an error, we need to adjust this probability. The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's error, is the error rate multiplied by the actual probability of a person being black:

0.2 (error rate) * 0.15 (probability of being black) = 0.03 (or 3%)

But we also need to consider the possibility that the witness was correct. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black is the witness's correct identification rate multiplied by the actual probability of a person being black:

0.8 (correct identification rate) * 0.15 (probability of being black) = 0.12 (or 12%)

So, the total probability of the attacker being black, considering both the witness's error and correct identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

0.03 (error probability) + 0.12 (correct probability) = 0.15 (or 15%)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (or 15%).
