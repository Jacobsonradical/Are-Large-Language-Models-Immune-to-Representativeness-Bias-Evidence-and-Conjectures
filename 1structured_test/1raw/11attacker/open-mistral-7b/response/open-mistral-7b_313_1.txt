Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false (the witness's error rate in identifying black people)
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the information given, we have:

- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the race 20% of the time)

We don't have direct information about P(~H), but we can find it using the total probability rule:

- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

- P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

- P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.12

So, based on the witness's statement and the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
