Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's race, we must use the witness's error rate instead of their accuracy rate.

In this case, the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black would mean they erroneously assigned the black race to someone who was actually white (given that the attacker's race is unknown). The probability of this happening is equal to the proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85 (85%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, is the error rate multiplied by the proportion of white people in the city:

{probability: 0.2, or 20%}

This means that, according to the witness's error rate, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's ability to judge race, which may not be entirely reliable in this situation.
