Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness account that the attacker was identified as black, but the witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80% accurate. Since the witness erred 20% of the time, this means that when the witness saw a person who was actually white, they incorrectly identified that person as black 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, we should subtract this error rate from the population percentage of black people to account for potential misidentifications.

So the probability that the attacker is actually black, considering both the population distribution and the witness's error rate, would be:

{probability: 0.15 - 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.105, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 10.5%.
