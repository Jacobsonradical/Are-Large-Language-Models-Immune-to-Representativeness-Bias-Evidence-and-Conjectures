Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we do not have information about how often the witness made a correct identification of the attacker's race, or how many times they made an error.

To make a probability estimate, we would need more information. However, assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker (which is a strong assumption), we could use the population statistics to make an estimate.

Given that 85% of the population is white, and the witness's error rate is 20%, we could estimate that 85% of the time the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as white, and 15% of the time they are making an error and identifying the attacker as black.

However, since we do not have information about how often the witness was correct in this specific case, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate. Therefore, I would advise caution in interpreting this estimate, as it is based on several assumptions and does not account for the specific circumstances of the attack.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number due to lack of information and necessary assumptions.}
