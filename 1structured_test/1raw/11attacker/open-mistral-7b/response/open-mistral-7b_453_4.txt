The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

We are given P(E|H) as 0.8 (80%), P(H) as 0.15 (15% black population), and P(E) can be calculated as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is the complementary hypothesis, attacker is white).

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2 (20%). Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.65

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.65 or 65%.
