Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races (which is a simplification, but a reasonable one for our purposes), then we can expect the witness to err in identifying a black person as white approximately 20% of the time.

So, when the witness identifies the attacker as black, we can assume that there is a 80% chance that the attacker is actually black, and a 20% chance that the witness has made an error.

However, we also know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. If the witness is correct, then the attacker must be black. But if the witness has made an error, then the attacker must be white.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, and the population is 85% white, we can expect that the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black about 20% * 0.85 = 17% of the time.

This means that when the witness identifies the attacker as black, there is a 80% chance that the attacker is actually black, and a 17% chance that the witness has made an error and the attacker is white.

So, the total probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
