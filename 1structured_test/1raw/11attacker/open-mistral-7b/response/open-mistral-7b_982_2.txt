To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black.
- P(B|W) as the probability that the witness identified a black person, given that the attacker is black.
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the witness identified a black person, given that the attacker is not black.

We are given that P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|~B) = 0.2, and P(B) = x (the probability we want to estimate).

The total probability of the witness identifying a black person is P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B).

Since we are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(~B) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(B|W): P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

Plugging in the values we have:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 = 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4 or 40%.

However, it's important to note that this estimation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case. Also, the witness's identification may not be entirely accurate, as they only identified the race with 80% accuracy. Therefore, this estimation should be considered as a rough estimate and not as a definitive answer.
