Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated.

First, we know that in the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% under similar conditions, with an error rate of 20%.

The witness identified the attacker as black. But since we cannot be 100% sure that the witness was correct, we need to consider the possibility of an error.

Let's assume that there is a certain probability p that the witness made an error in this particular case. If the witness made an error, then the attacker is actually white (given the city's demographics).

Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time, this means that the error rate is 20%. So, p = 0.2 (the probability of the witness making an error).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(attacker is black and witness is correct) / (P(attacker is black and witness is correct) + P(attacker is white and witness is incorrect))

Using the given probabilities, we can calculate this as:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.12 / 0.172 = 0.7

However, since the witness's identification could be an error, we need to account for this possibility. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the possibility of an error, is:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is correct) + P(attacker is white | witness's identification) * P(witness's identification is incorrect)

Using the given probabilities, we can calculate this as:

P(attacker is black) = (0.12) * (1) + (0.85) * (0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
