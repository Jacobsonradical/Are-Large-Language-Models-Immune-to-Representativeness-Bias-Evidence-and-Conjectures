Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erred in identifying race 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (100% - 15%) (majority of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [((0.8) * (0.15)) + ((0.2) * (0.85))]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.37

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.37 or 37%.
