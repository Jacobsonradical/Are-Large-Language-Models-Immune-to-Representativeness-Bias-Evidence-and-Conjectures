To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (probability: 0.8), and the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error (probability: 0.2), and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the second scenario is the probability of the witness erring multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white:

0.2 (witness error) * 0.85 (white population) = 0.17 (estimated probability of the attacker being white if the witness errs)

Now we can calculate the probability of the first scenario:

0.8 (witness correct identification) * 0.15 (black population) = 0.12 (estimated probability of the attacker being black if the witness correctly identifies the race)

The overall probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities in both scenarios:

0.12 (witness correct) + 0.17 (witness error) = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29, or 29%.
