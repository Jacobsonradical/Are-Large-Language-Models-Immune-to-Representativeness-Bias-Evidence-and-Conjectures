Given the information provided, we can make an estimate using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given our information, we can break it down as follows:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% from the city's demographics. So, P(H) = 0.15
2. P(E|H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 80% as given in the information. So, P(E|H) = 0.8
3. P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20% as given in the information. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2
4. P(~H) is the probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85
5. P(E) is the probability of the witness making any identification, which is the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|~H) * P(~H). So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 67%.
