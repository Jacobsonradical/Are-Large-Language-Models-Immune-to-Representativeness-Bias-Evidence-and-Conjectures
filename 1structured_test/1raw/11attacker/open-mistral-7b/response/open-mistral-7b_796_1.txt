Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification, is 80%.

However, we should also consider the demographics of the city, as mentioned in the second piece of information. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the attack happened at random in the city, then the actual probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (or 15%). However, the witness's identification suggests a different probability, which is 0.8 (or 80%). This is a clear contradiction between the two pieces of information. It's important to note that the witness's identification is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the attacker's race, especially considering the low light conditions and the potential for bias.

In conclusion, based on the demographics of the city, the actual probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. However, given the witness's identification, there is a higher probability of 0.8 that the attacker is black, but this probability is likely inflated due to the witness's error rate and potential bias.

{probability: 0.15 for the actual probability, 0.8 with caution due to the witness's identification}
