To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we need to account for both possibilities: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified him, and the attacker is not black and the witness erroneously identified him as black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race is P(black) * 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time). The probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black is (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying black people 20% of the time when the actual race is not black).

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we can set up an equation:

Witness's statement = P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2

The witness's statement is the observed event, which is that the witness identified the attacker as black. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given this observation:

P(black | Witness's statement) = P(Witness's statement | black) * P(black) / [P(Witness's statement | black) * P(black) + P(Witness's statement | not black) * P(not black)]

We already have P(Witness's statement | black) and P(Witness's statement | not black) from the previous equation. To calculate P(black) and P(not black), we can use the information about the racial composition of the city:

P(black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(not black) = 1 - P(black) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(black | Witness's statement):

P(black | Witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

{probability: 0.333, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.333 or 33.3%.
