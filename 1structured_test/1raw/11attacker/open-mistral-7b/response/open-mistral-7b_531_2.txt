Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% (as mentioned in point "a"), and the city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black (as mentioned in point "b").

Since the witness made an error in 20% of their race identifications, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between incorrectly identifying whites as blacks and incorrectly identifying blacks as whites.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case by looking at the probability of them incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

The probability of the witness making an error in identifying a white person as black is the probability of drawing a white person from the city's population multiplied by the error rate of 20%.

So, the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a white person as black is 0.85 (the probability of drawing a white person) * 0.20 (the error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and they made an error in 17% of their race identifications, we can assume that there's a 17% chance that the attacker is actually white.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.83}
