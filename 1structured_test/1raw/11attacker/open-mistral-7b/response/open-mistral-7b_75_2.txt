Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed black. However, we should also consider the racial composition of the city, as the attacker could have been mistakenly identified.

The city is 85% white and 15% black. The probability that a random person in the city is black is 0.15. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, there is a 20% chance that they mistakenly identified a white person as black.

So, the total probability of the attacker being black, considering both the witness's accuracy and the city's racial composition, is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black without error and the probability of the witness making an error:

Probability = 0.8 (witness's accuracy) + 0.2 * 0.15 (witness's error rate * probability of a random person being black)

Probability = 0.8 + 0.03

Probability = 0.83

{probability: 0.83}
