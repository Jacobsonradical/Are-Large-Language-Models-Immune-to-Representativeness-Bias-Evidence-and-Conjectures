Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black adds an additional piece of information, but it is not necessarily accurate due to the witness's potential error rate. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the demographic data.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, and divided by the probability of event B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, we want to find P(Attacker is Black | Witness Says Black).

1. P(Attacker is Black) is the population demographic, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. P(Witness Says Black | Attacker is Black) is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.80.
3. P(Attacker is Black) is the probability that the witness would make a false positive claim, which can be calculated as 1 - the witness's accuracy rate in identifying whites as blacks (since they are half of the population). This is calculated as 1 - (1 - 0.20) * 0.85 = 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.15 = 0.03.

Using these values, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Says Black) = P(Witness Says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / P(Witness Says Black)

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Says Black) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.03) = 0.211

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the demographic data, is approximately 21.1%.
