Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 20% or 0.2, and since 85% of the population is white, we can calculate this value as 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.14.
- P(~H): the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.45

So our estimate, based on the given information, is that there is a 45% probability that the attacker is black.
