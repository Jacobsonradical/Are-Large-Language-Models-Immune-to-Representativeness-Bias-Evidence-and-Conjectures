Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct. In this case, the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this event is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's identification might be incorrect. In this case, the attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identifies him as black. The probability of this event is the proportion of white people in the city times the error rate of the witness in identifying race, which is 0.85 (85%) * 0.20 (20%).

The total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18, probability: 0.18}

Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.18 (18%). However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is reliable under the specific conditions of the attack, which may not be the case. Additionally, this estimate does not take into account other potential evidence or factors that could influence the true identity of the attacker.
