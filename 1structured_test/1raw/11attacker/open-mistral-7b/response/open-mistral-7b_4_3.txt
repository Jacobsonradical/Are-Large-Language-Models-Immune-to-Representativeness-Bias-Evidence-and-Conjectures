To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as follows:

Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person = Probability of a person being black * Witness's accuracy in identifying black people
                                                                           = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                           = 0.12

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white = Probability of a person being black * Witness's error rate
                                                                                            = 0.15 * 0.2
                                                                                            = 0.03

Now, the witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was actually white, then the witness would have incorrectly identified the attacker's race. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white is equal to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white:

Probability of attacker being white = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white
                                                       = 0.03

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.88, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

However, the witness's statement to the court suggests that the attacker was indeed identified as black. Given this, it might be more appropriate to assume that the witness's identification is correct, and the probability of the attacker being black is 1.

Therefore, taking both possibilities into account (assuming the witness's identification is imperfect and assuming the witness's identification is correct), the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is between 0.88 and 1.
