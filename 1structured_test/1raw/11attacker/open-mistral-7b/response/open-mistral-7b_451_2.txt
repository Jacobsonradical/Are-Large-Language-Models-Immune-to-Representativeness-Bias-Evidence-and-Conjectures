Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, and the witness's identification is also a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we don't have enough information to estimate accurately. However, we can use the population statistics provided in the information: 85% of the population is white, so 15% is black.

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which we know is 0.8.

P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is the witness's error rate, which we know is 0.2.

P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now we can estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.75

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.75 or 75%. This estimate takes into account the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the population, but it assumes that the attacker's race is a random event and that the witness's identification is also a random event. In reality, these assumptions may not hold, and the actual probability could be different.
