Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information as 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black (given in the second piece of information as 0.8)
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (given in the second piece of information as 0.2)
- P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (which we want to find)

We are given P(A) and P(B|A) and P(B|not A). We can calculate P(not A) as the complement of P(A), which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.28, or 28%.

So, based on the provided information and assumptions, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.28, or 28%.
