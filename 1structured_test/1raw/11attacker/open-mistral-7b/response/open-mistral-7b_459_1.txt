The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we only have the attacker's race identified by the witness, but we don't know if this identification was correct or not. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally distributed between races (which is not necessarily the case), then the probability of the witness's identification being correct is 80%, and the probability of it being incorrect is 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, if the witness's identification was correct, we would expect 85% of the attackers to be white. But since we don't know if the witness's identification was correct, we can't use this information directly.

However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is the witness's ability to correctly identify black people, which is 0.8. The probability of the witness identifying any random person as black is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black person and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person. Given that the witness identifies whites as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So the probability of the witness identifying any random person as black is 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies as black) = P(Witness identifies as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness identifies as black)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated above, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identifies as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.13

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.13 or 13%. This estimate is lower than the 15% black population of the city because the witness's identification is likely to be less reliable for black people than for white people, given the witness's error rate.
