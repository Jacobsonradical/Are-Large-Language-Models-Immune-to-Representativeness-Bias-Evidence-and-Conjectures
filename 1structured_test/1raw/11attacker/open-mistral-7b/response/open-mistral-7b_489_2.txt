Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time.
2. The demographic distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of attacker being black in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (which we can't directly calculate but we can rewrite the equation to avoid it)

Given the problem, we know P(E|H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population), and we want to find P(H|E).

To avoid calculating P(E), we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

We don't know P(E|not H) (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white) but we can use the information that the witness is correct 80% of the time to infer that they must be incorrect 20% of the time.

Given that the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.02. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 0.85 * 0.98 = 0.826.

Therefore, P(E|not H) = 0.15 * 0.02 + 0.85 * 0.826 = 0.136

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.136 * 0.85]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.174

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 17.4%.
