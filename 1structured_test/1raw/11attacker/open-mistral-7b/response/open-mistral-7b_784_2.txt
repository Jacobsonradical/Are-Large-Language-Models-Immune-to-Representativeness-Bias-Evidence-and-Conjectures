To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W).

Given that the witness's accuracy is 80%, when they incorrectly identify a white person as black, they are actually identifying a black person who blends in with the majority white population. This means that the actual proportion of black attackers in the city is higher than the 15% reported in the population statistics.

We can model this situation using Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, times the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In this case, the evidence is the witness's statement, and the hypothesis is that the attacker is black. The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(B)) is 0.15 (15%), and the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(Evidence|B)) is 0.8 (80%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white (P(Evidence|W)) is the complement of P(Evidence|B), or 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Since the prior probability of the attacker being white (P(W)) is 1 - P(B) = 0.85, we can write Bayes' theorem as:

P(B|Evidence) = [P(Evidence|B) * P(B)] / [P(Evidence|B) * P(B) + P(Evidence|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|Evidence) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this value, we find that the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.37 or 37%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
