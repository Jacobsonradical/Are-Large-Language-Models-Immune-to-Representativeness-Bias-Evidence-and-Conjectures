Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to identify race correctly is 80%, and they err incorrectly 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black can be calculated by considering both the population statistics and the witness's error rate.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could either be a correct identification (since the attacker is actually black) or an error (since the attacker is white). Let's denote the probability of the witness's identification being correct as P(black), and the probability of it being an error as P(white).

We know that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85, and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is:
P(white) \* 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%

This means that there is a 17% chance that the witness saw a white person and mistakenly identified them as black. Since this is not the case, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the witness saw a black person and correctly identified them:

P(black) = 1 - P(white) \* 0.20 = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification is not the only evidence in this case. The population statistics should also be considered. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15.

Given both pieces of information, the most conservative estimate would be to weight the witness's identification and the population statistics equally. This would mean taking the average of the two probabilities:

(0.83 + 0.15) / 2 = 0.59 or 59%

Therefore, based on the information provided and considering both the population statistics and the witness's error rate, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 59%. This estimate should be used as a starting point for further investigation or analysis, not as a definitive conclusion.
