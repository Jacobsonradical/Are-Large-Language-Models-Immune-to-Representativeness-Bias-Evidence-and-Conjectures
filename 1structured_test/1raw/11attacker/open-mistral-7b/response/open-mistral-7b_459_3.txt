To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- Ā: the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: the witness's testimony

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given E (P(A|E)) can be calculated as follows:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā))

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(E|Ā) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(Ā) = 0.85 (the population is 85% white)

Now, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So, based on the witness's testimony and the population statistics, we estimate that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black.
