To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness was able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Since the witness is not perfectly reliable, we cannot simply assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black means that the attacker is indeed black. Instead, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote:
- p as the true probability that the attacker is black
- q as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that p + q = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white).

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, there's a chance that the witness made an error. If the attacker is white, the witness would erroneously identify him as black with a probability of 0.2. If the attacker is black, the witness would correctly identify him with a probability of 0.8.

Given the witness's identification, the actual probability that the attacker is black can be written as:

p = (Probability of witness identifying attacker as black given attacker is black) * (Proportion of black attackers) + (Probability of witness identifying attacker as black given attacker is white) * (Proportion of white attackers)

p = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

p = 0.12 + 0.17

p = 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
