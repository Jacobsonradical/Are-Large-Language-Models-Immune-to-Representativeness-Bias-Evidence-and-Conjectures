Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to identify race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental formula in probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black
- P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the given information, we can calculate:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness's inaccuracy)
P(H) = 0.15 (population composition)
P(~H) = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.26

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 26%.
