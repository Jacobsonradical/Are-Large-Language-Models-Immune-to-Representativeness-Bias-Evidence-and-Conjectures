To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white. In this case, the witness incorrectly identified the race.

The probability of scenario 1 (attacker is black) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the proportion of black people in the city.

The probability of scenario 2 (attacker is white) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person times the proportion of white people in the city.

We know that:
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%)
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person is 0.2 (20%)
- The proportion of black people in the city is 0.15 (15%)
- The proportion of white people in the city is 0.85 (85%)

So, the probability of scenario 1 (attacker is black) is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%)

The probability of scenario 2 (attacker is white) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%)

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we can find this probability by adding the probability of scenario 1 and subtracting the probability of scenario 2:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of scenario 1 - Probability of scenario 2
                                                      = 0.12 - 0.17
                                                      = -0.05

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it seems that there might be an error in the information or in the analysis. The given data seems to suggest that the attacker is more likely to be white than black, which contradicts the witness's testimony. It would be important to re-examine the data or the reasoning to resolve this inconsistency.

Therefore, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
