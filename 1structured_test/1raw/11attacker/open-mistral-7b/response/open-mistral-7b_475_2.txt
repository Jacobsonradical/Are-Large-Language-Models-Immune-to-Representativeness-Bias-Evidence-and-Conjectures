To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually white, they mistakenly identify that person as black 20% of the time. Similarly, when they see a person who is actually black, they mistakenly identify that person as white 20% of the time.

In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness encounters a random person from the city, the probability that the person is white is 0.85, and the probability that the person is black is 0.15.

When the witness encounters a white person, they have a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying that person as black. So, the actual probability that the witness sees a white person and correctly identifies them as such is 0.85 - 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.6725.

Similarly, when the witness encounters a black person, they have a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying that person as white. So, the actual probability that the witness sees a black person and correctly identifies them as such is 0.15 - 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.1100.

Since the witness saw a black person and correctly identified them as such, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person: 0.1100.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.1100}
