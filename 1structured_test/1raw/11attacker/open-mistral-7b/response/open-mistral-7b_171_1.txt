Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the city's demographics, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness, who is not perfectly reliable, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's try to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black:

1. Since the witness is not perfectly reliable, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him, or the attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified him as black.
2. The probability of the first scenario is the real proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.
3. The probability of the second scenario is the probability that the witness makes a mistake and incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).
4. To find the total probability of either scenario, we add the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black and correctly identified) + 0.17 (probability of the attacker being white and mistakenly identified) = 0.32 (32%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.32.
