Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to adjust the witness's identification by considering the racial composition of the city. Since the witness's ability to identify race correctly is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as the attacker.

The probability of correctly identifying a black person when the attacker is indeed black is the witness's correct identification rate (0.8) multiplied by the proportion of black people in the city (0.15).

So, the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a black person as the attacker when the attacker is actually white. Since the city is 85% white, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29} or 29%.
