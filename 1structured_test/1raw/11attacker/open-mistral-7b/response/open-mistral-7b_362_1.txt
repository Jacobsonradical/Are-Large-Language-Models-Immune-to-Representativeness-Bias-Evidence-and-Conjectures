Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% probability of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% probability of making an error. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it means they erred in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white is the probability of the witness's error, which is 20%.

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 minus the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

There seems to be a contradiction between the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the information about the population composition in the city. If the witness's ability to judge a person's race under the given conditions is accurate, then the attacker's race should not necessarily be inferred based on the witness's statement.

Therefore, based on the provided information with the contradiction, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. A more detailed investigation or additional information would be required to make a more accurate assessment.
