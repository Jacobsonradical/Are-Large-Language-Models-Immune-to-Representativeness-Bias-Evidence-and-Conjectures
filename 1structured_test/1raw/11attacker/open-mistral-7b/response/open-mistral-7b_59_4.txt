Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker other than the witness's identification, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is equal to the witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
