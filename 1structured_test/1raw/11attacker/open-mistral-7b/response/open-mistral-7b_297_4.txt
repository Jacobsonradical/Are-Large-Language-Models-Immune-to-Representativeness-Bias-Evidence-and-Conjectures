Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The event we're interested in is the attacker's race being black. Let's denote this as H (hypothesis). The prior probability of H, which is the probability of this event occurring before considering any evidence, is given in part A of the information as 15%. That is, P(H) = 0.15.

The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. Let's denote this as E (evidence). The likelihood of this evidence given the hypothesis is given in part B of the information as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time). That is, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The prior probability of not the attacker being black, which is the probability of the event not occurring before considering any evidence, is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

The likelihood of the evidence given not the attacker being black is given by the error rate of the witness. Since the witness erred in 20% of the cases, the likelihood of this evidence given not the hypothesis is P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, which is the probability of the event occurring after considering the evidence, using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.368.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.368}
