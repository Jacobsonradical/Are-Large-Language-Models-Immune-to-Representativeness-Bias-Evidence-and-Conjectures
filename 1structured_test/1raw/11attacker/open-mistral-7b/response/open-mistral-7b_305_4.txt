Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given:
1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
3. P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 (20%).
4. P(A) + P(not A) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or not black).
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Using these values, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A) = 1 * 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|not A) = 0.2

Substituting these values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
