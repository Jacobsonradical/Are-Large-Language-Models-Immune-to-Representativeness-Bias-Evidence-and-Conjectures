Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black.
3. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (black). In this case, the attacker is actually black.

Scenario 2: The witness made an error. This means the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black.

Since we don't have more information, it's reasonable to assume that both scenarios have an equal chance of happening (given that the witness is not perfect).

The probability of Scenario 1 (the attacker is black) is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability is 0.8.

The probability of Scenario 2 (the attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identifies him as black) is equal to the probability that the witness makes an error. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability is 0.2.

Since both scenarios have equal chances of happening, we can find the overall probability of the attacker being black by adding the probabilities of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0, please note that the sum should be between 0 and 1. However, in this case, the sum is greater than 1 due to the error in the witness's ability to identify race. This indicates a problem with the information provided or an assumption made in the analysis. To properly address this issue, more information is needed.}

To fix this issue, we should consider the possibility of a bias in the witness's ability to identify race. If the witness has a higher error rate in identifying white people as black compared to black people as white, then Scenario 2 might not have an equal chance of happening. In this case, we would need more information about the witness's bias to accurately estimate the probability of the attacker being black.
