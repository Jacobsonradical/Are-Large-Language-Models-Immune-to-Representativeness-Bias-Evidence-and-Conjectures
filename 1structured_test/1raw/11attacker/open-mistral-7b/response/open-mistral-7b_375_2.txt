Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important distinction to be made between the racial demographics of the city and the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony. The witness's testimony is not based on the city's demographics but rather on their own fallible ability to identify race.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and considering their accuracy rate of 80%, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black. This would be the same as the witness's success rate in identifying black individuals:

{probability: 0.8}

So, based on the witness's testimony and their ability to accurately identify race, we estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8, or 80%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is consistent in all situations, which may not be the case. Additionally, the testimony alone is not sufficient evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
