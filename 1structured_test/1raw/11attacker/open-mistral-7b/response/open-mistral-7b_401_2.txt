Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. However, we should note that the witness's identification is not perfect, as they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Since we can't assume that the witness is always correct, we should consider the possibility that they made a mistake. The error rate of 20% means that there is a 20% chance that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness making such a mistake is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, the witness did not identify the attacker as white. This means that there are only two possibilities: the attacker is indeed black (as the witness claimed), or the witness made an error and the attacker is white. The probability of the second possibility is 0.17.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness's ability to judge race in the dark is different from their performance in daylight or under better lighting conditions. If the witness's ability to judge race is worse in the dark, then the probability that they correctly identified the attacker's race could be less than 0.8.

Therefore, while the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.83, this estimate should be treated with caution due to the potential impact of lighting conditions on the witness's ability to judge race.
