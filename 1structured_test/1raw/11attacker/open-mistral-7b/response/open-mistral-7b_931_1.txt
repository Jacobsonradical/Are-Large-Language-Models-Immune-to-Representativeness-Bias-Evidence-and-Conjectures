Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. It allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's statement and the population data).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence (the witness's statement and the population data), P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we can estimate from the population data), P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's ability to correctly identify race), and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

The witness's statement gives us a 100% probability of evidence E1 (the witness identifying the attacker as black), and a 0% probability of evidence E0 (the witness not identifying the attacker as black). However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability of E0, so we'll assume it's 0 for now (which might not be the most accurate, but it's the best we can do with the given information).

So, the probability of E given H is 100% for E1 and 0% for E0.

The prior probability of H (the attacker being black) can be estimated from the population data: P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of E (the witness's statement) can be calculated from the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the population data:

P(E) = P(E1) + P(E0) = P(E1) = P(H) * P(E1 | H) + P(!H) * P(E1 | !H)

Where:
- !H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black
- P(E1 | !H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(E1 | !H), we'll assume it's 0 for now (which might not be the most accurate, but it's the best we can do with the given information).

So, P(E) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = (P(E | H) * P(H)) / P(E) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.15 = 1

But this doesn't make sense, because the probability of a hypothesis should always be between 0 and 1. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the given data or in my calculations.

However, given that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is extremely high, it's likely that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement, even if we can't calculate the exact probability.

So, {probability: 1 (although this might not be the most accurate), please provide a number between 0 and 1} is not a valid answer, but it suggests that the attacker is likely to be black based on the given information.

A more accurate answer would require more information, such as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (P(E1 | !H)).
