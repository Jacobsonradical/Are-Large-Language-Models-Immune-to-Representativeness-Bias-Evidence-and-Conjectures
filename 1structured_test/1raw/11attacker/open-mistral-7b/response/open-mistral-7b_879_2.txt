To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. The general population distribution: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

2. The witness's error rate: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

A) The witness correctly identified a black person as the attacker.
B) The witness erroneously identified a white person as black.

The probability of A is the proportion of black people in the population, which is 0.15 (15%). The probability of B is the witness's error rate when identifying white people as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

Since we cannot know for sure which case occurred, we need to consider both possibilities and their probabilities. The overall probability of the witness identifying a black person (either correctly or incorrectly) is the sum of the probabilities of A and B.

P(attacker is black) = P(correctly identified black attacker) + P(erroneously identified white attacker as black)

P(correctly identified black attacker) = Proportion of black people in the population (0.15)
P(erroneously identified white attacker as black) = Witness's error rate when identifying white people as black (0.2)

So, P(attacker is black) = 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.18

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.18 or 18%.
