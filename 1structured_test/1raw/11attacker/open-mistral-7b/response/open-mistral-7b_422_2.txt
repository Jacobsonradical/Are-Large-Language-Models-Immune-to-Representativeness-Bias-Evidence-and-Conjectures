To provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information a)
2. P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies a black attacker as black = 1 (since the attacker is indeed black, the witness will correctly identify him as such)
3. P(B|~A) = probability that the witness identifies a white attacker as black = 0.2 (from information b)
4. P(A|B) = probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black, which is what we want to find

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.469

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.469 or 46.9%.
