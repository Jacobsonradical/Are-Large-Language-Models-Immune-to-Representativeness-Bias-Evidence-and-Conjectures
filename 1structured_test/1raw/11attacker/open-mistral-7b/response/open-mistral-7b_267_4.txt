Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The theorem states that the posterior probability (P(A|B)) of a hypothesis A given evidence B is proportional to the prior probability of A (P(A)) and the likelihood of B given A (P(B|A)), divided by the prior probability of B (P(B)).

In this case:
- A: attacker is black
- B: witness identified attacker as black

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. The prior probability of B (P(B)) is the reliability of the witness, which is 0.8 (80%). The likelihood of B given A (P(B|A)) is 1, because if the attacker is black, then the witness correctly identifying him as black is a certain event.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 1 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.1875 or 18.75%. This means that based on the information and assumptions provided, we believe that there is a 18.75% chance that the attacker is black. Note that this is a probabilistic estimate and does not imply any certainty about the attacker's race.
