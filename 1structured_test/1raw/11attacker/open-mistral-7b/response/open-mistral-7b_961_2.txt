Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the true race of the attacker, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(E|H) is the likelihood of E given H, and P(E) is the probability of E.

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the population statistics as 0.15 (15%).

P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's ability to correctly identify race, which we calculated to be 0.8.

P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the likelihood of that happening if the attacker is black and the likelihood of that happening if the attacker is white, multiplied by the probabilities of those events.

P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
