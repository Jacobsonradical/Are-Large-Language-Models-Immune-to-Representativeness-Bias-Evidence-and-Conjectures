To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B (P(A|B)) is equal to the likelihood of the evidence given the event (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of the event (P(A)) divided by the probability of the evidence (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let's break this down:

1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Evidence B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black. This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) = Witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black. Given a sample of people, half white and half black, the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, or P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(B) = Probability of witness identifying someone as black. This is the probability of drawing a black person from the population and having the witness correctly identify them as black, plus the probability of drawing a white person and having the witness incorrectly identify them as black.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black:
- P(B|A) * P(A) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person. This is 0.8 * P(A).
- P(B|~A) * P(~A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. This is (1 - 0.8) * 0.85.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * P(A) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.15 * 0.85)]

Solve for P(A):

P(A) = [(0.8 * P(A|B)) / 0.77]

Since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can't directly solve for P(A) from the given information. However, we can calculate the value of P(A) that maximizes P(A|B). By plugging different values of P(A) into the equation, we find that the maximum occurs when P(A) = 0.5.

In this case, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not provide enough information to significantly change our prior belief that the attacker is black (since the population is 85% white and 15% black). Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.5.
