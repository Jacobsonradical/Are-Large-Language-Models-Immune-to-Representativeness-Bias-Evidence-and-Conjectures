Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness mistakenly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. If the attacker is white, there's a 15% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify them as black. This means that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 85% of the time.

Since 85% of the population in the city is white, the probability that the attacker is white, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the probability of the witness making a mistake on a white person times the probability of the attacker being white:

P(attacker is white | witness ID is black) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Using the principle of conditional probability, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the probability of the attacker being black:

P(attacker is black | witness ID is black) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
