Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have any information about the race of the attacker being correct or incorrect in this specific case.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the witness's error rate as a proxy for the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black. Since 85% of the population is white, if the attacker was white, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify him as black.

On the other hand, if the attacker was black, there would be a 0% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify him as white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this means that there is an 80% chance that the witness would correctly identify a black person as black.

Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black by subtracting the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a white person as black from 1.

So, the probability that the attacker is black = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 or 80%.
