Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, has an error rate of 20% when identifying race. This means that in 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, and in 20% of the cases, the witness makes an error.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying the race.

The probability of the first scenario (the attacker is black) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, given that the attacker is black. This can be calculated as the probability of the attacker being black times the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is black.

The probability of the second scenario (the attacker is white) is the probability that the attacker is white, times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is white.

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we need to find the ratio of these two probabilities.

The probability of the attacker being black (P(attacker is black)) = [P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies attacker's race | attacker is black)] / [P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies attacker's race | attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker's race | attacker is white)]

We know that P(attacker is black) = 0.15 and P(attacker is white) = 0.85. Also, P(witness correctly identifies attacker's race | attacker is black) = 0.8 and P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker's race | attacker is white) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(attacker is black) = [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]

Calculating this, we get:

P(attacker is black) = 0.12

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
