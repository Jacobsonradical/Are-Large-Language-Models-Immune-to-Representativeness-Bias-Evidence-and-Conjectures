The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being black
- Event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15%
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, which is given as 80%
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the identification, which can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black attacker).

We are given that P(B|not A) is 20%. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.4375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4375 or 43.75%.
