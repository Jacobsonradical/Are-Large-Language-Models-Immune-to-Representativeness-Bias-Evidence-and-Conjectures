To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A given the evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence

In our case:
- A is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (given that the attacker is black, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (given that the attacker is not black, the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time)
  P(not A) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
