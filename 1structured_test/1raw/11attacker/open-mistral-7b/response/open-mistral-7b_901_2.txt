To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8. The prior probability of the hypothesis is 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black).

To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability. Since the population is half white and half black, the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the person's actual race, is 0.5 (50%) if the person is black and 0.2 (20%) if the person is white. So, P(E) = 0.1 * 0.8 + 0.9 * 0.2 = 0.16.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.5625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5625 or 56.25%.
