Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is estimated as follows:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, this means that they will misidentify a white person as black 20% of the time when they encounter a mixed sample of half white and half black people.

Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot assume that the witness's identification is correct. However, we can use the witness's success rate as an indication of the probability that the attacker is black, because the error rate of the witness also implies a probability that the attacker is actually white.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white). We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white).

The witness correctly identifies the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8, which means that the probability of the witness being correct is equivalent to the probability that the attacker is black: P(black) = 0.8

However, we also know that the witness makes an error 20% of the time, which means that they will incorrectly identify a white person as black. The probability of the witness being wrong is equivalent to the probability that the attacker is white: P(white) = 0.2

Since the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, this means that when they encounter a mixed sample of half white and half black people, they will correctly identify the race 80% of the time. This can be calculated as follows:

P(correct identification) = P(black) \* probability of identifying black person correctly + P(white) \* probability of identifying white person correctly
= 0.8 \* 1 + 0.2 \* 0 = 0.8

Given that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, we can conclude that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8. However, since the witness is not perfect, this probability should be considered as an estimate, not an absolute truth. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
