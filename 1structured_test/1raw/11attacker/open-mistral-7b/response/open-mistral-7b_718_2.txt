To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (given in the second piece of information)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (also given in the second piece of information)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (1 - P(B))

We're looking for P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

We have values for P(B), P(W|B), and P(W|~B) from the information provided:

- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.173

So, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.3%.
