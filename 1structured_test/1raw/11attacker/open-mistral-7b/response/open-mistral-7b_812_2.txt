Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as "attacker is black" and event W as "witness identifies attacker as black."

From the first piece of information, we know the prior probability of A: P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).

From the second piece of information, we know the likelihood of W given A: P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time). Also, we know the likelihood of W given not-A (denoted as not-A): P(W|not-A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not-A) * P(not-A)]

We know P(W|not-A) = 0.2 and P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.12 (or 12%). This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness.
