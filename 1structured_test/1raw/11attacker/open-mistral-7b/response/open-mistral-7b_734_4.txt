To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness's statement that the attacker is black

We have the following information:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not-H) * P(not-H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (the probability of the witness making this statement given any attacker, regardless of race)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.29] = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
