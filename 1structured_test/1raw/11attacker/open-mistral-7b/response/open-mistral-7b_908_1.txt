Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15%.
2. The reliability of the witness's racial identification, which is stated as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker was black could be a correct identification or an error. Since we don't know which it is, we need to consider both possibilities.

If the witness's identification was correct, then the attacker is indeed black, and the probability is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

If the witness's identification was incorrect, then the attacker is actually white, despite the witness's statement. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that their identification of the attacker as black was an error.

So, the probability that the witness's identification was incorrect, and the attacker is actually white, is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since we need to account for both possibilities, we can calculate the overall probability by adding these two probabilities:

The probability that the attacker is black = Probability of correct identification (0.15) + Probability of incorrect identification (0.2) * Probability of identifying a white person as black (1 - 0.8, or 0.2)

The probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%)

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 17%. This estimate takes into account both the proportion of black people in the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.
