Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness made an error in this specific case, identifying the attacker as black.

The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness made an error, we cannot assume that their identification is accurate. We should consider the possibility that they made an error in the direction of the more common race, which is white, given the city's demographics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, would be the error rate of the witness for identifying black people, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
