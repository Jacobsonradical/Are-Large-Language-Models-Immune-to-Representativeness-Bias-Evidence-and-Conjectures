To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (the attacker is either black or white)
- P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) (the witness's overall accuracy)

We are given that P(W) = 0.8, P(B) = x, and P(~B) = 1 - x. We also know that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|~B) = 0.2 (based on the witness's performance).

Now we can set up two equations to solve for x:

1) 0.8 = 0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x)

From equation 1), we can solve for x:

x = 0.8 / 1.0 = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
