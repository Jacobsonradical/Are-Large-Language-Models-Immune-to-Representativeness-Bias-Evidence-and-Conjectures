To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

- P(E|H) is the probability that a black person was misidentified as white by the witness. Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 (20/100).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness identification), which is 0.85 (85/100) for a black attacker and 0.15 (15/100) for a white attacker, given the city's demographics.

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, the probability that a black person was correctly identified is 0.8 (80/100). This means that the probability that a white person was incorrectly identified as black is 0.15 * 0.2 / 0.85 = 0.03 (3/100).

So, P(E|H) = 0.2 and P(E|~H) = 0.03

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

P(H) is our unknown, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for it:

P(H) = [P(H|E) * P(E)] / [P(E|H)]

We know P(E|H) = 0.2 and P(E) = 0.85

Substituting these values, we get:

P(H) = (0.2 * 0.85) / 0.2 = 1.7 / 2 = 0.85

Since the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1, we can round this value to 0.8. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.
