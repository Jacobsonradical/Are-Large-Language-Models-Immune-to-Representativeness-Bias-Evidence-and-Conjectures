The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the provided information, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down the terms for this specific problem:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can estimate using the population statistics provided in b: 0.15 (15%)
- P(E|H): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black, which is stated in a: 0.8
- P(E): Probability of the witness giving the identification "black", regardless of the actual race of the attacker. This can be calculated using the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)) and the probability of the witness erring, given that the attacker is black (1 - P(E|H)): 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.68 = 0.78

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.78 â‰ˆ 0.14 (or 14%)

So, based on the provided information, the witness's identification, and Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14%. Please note that this is an estimation and may not reflect the actual probability in the real world.
