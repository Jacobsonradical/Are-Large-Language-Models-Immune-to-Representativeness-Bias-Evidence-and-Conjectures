Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the city's demographic data and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. According to the demographic data, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This can be represented as a probability of 0.85 for white and 0.15 for black.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% under similar conditions, and they err in 20% of the cases. This can be represented as a probability of 0.8 for correct identification and 0.2 for error.

However, the witness's statement that the attacker is black contradicts the initial scenario where the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, it seems there might be a discrepancy or misunderstanding in the information provided.

In order to provide a strict answer, we would need to clarify this discrepancy or have more information about the witness's certainty or circumstances surrounding their identification. As it stands, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate based on the given information.
