Given the information provided, we have a witness who has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means they made an error in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white is the error rate, which is 20%.

Since the total population is 100% white and black combined, we can subtract the probability of the attacker being white from 1 to find the probability of the attacker being black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8}

This means that our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 80%.
