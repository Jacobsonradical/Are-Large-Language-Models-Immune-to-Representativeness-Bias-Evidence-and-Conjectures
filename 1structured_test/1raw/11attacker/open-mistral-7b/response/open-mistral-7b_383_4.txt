Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the city's demographics and the witness's reliability.

1. The city's demographics suggest that 15% of the population is black. This can be represented as {probability: 0.15}.

2. However, the witness's reliability suggests that they are likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. This means that when they say they saw a black person, there is a 20% chance they are mistaken and it's actually a white person. Conversely, when they say they saw a white person, they are correct 80% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and there is a 20% chance they are mistaken, the true probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 * 0.15 = {probability: 0.12, or 12%}.

Therefore, while the city's demographics would suggest a 15% chance, the witness's testimony and their known error rate suggests a lower probability of 12%.
