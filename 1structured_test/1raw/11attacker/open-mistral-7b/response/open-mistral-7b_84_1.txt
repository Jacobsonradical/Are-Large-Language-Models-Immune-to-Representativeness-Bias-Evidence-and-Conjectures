Based on the information provided, the attacker was identified as black by the witness with an accuracy of 80%. However, we also know that in the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Since the witness's accuracy is lower than the actual population distribution, there seems to be a bias in the witness's identification.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying a black person)
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the attacker's race)

Using these values, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
P(H|E) = 0.2 * 0.75
P(H|E) = 0.15625

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.63%. This is lower than the actual population distribution, suggesting that the witness's identification may be biased. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the limited information provided and may not accurately reflect the true probability.
