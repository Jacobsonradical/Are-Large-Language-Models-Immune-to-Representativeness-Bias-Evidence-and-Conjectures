To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we should consider the witness's error rate as well. If the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, the actual attacker could be white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85 (85%) and that they are black is 0.15 (15%). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

However, since we are considering the possibility that the attacker is actually white, this 17% should be subtracted from the probability of the attacker being black. So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's error, is 0.15 - 0.17 = -0.02 (-2%).

However, it's important to note that the probability cannot be negative. This result indicates that the information provided is not sufficient to make a conclusive estimate, and more information is needed to determine the probability that the attacker is black.

To provide a probability estimate, we can use the witness's correct identification rate instead of the error rate. Given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and given that 15% of the population is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's ability to identify race, is 0.12 (12%). This indicates that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, based on the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.
