To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness identifies races correctly 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies races 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given that the witness is not perfect and there is a higher proportion of white people in the city, it is likely that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. Let's calculate the probability of this error happening:

1. Probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black: 20% (the error rate) * 85% (the proportion of white people) = 0.17 (or 17%)

2. Probability of a black person being correctly identified by the witness: 80% (the correct identification rate) * 15% (the proportion of black people) = 0.12 (or 12%)

However, the witness claimed that the attacker was black. So, given the scenario, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a black person being correctly identified by the witness, which is 0.12.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
