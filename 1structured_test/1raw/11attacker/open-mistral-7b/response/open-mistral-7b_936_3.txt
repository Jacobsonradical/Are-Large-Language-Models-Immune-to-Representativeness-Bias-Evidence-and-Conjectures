To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a method for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the reliability of the witness)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (which we cannot directly calculate, but can normalize P(H | E) to 1)

From the provided information, we have:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

We cannot directly calculate P(E), but we can calculate P(H | E) and normalize it to 1:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / P(E)

We want P(H | E) to be the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification, so we want to find the value of P(H | E) that satisfies this condition. To do that, we can set P(H | E) = 1 and solve for P(E):

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / P(E) = 1
P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / P(H | E)

Now, we can find P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [0.12] / P(E)

Since we want P(H | E) = 1, we can solve for P(E):

P(E) = 0.12

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being black:

{probability: 0.12 / P(E)}
{probability: 0.12 / 0.12}
{probability: 1}

However, this result is not possible because a probability should be between 0 and 1. This indicates that the witness's reliability is too high to be consistent with the given population proportions. It is unlikely that a witness who is only correct 80% of the time would identify an attacker as black when the actual proportion of black people in the city is only 15%. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
