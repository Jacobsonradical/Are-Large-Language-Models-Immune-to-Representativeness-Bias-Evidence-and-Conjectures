To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(A), and the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is black as P(B|A). Similarly, let P(A^c) be the probability that the attacker is not black, and P(B|A^c) be the probability that the witness identifies a person as black given that the person is not black.

According to the information provided, we have:
1. P(A) = the probability that the attacker is black
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
3. P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
4. P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
5. P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 (since the total probability of the two mutually exclusive events is 1)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)].

We can substitute the known values into this formula:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

Since we don't have a specific value for P(A), we can't provide a specific number as the probability that the attacker is black. However, we can find the value of P(A|B) for different values of P(A) by solving the equation above.

For example, if P(A) = 0.1 (meaning the attacker is black only 10% of the time), then P(A|B) = 0.64. If P(A) = 0.5 (meaning the attacker is black half of the time), then P(A|B) = 0.8. And if P(A) = 0.9 (meaning the attacker is black 90% of the time), then P(A|B) = 0.97.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, it seems unlikely that the attacker is black 90% of the time, but it's also possible that the witness's statement is not reliable enough to make such a strong conclusion. Therefore, a more reasonable estimate might be around 0.5 or 50%. However, without more information, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.
