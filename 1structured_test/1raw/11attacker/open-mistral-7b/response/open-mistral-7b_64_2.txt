The information provided can be used to make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

First, we know the racial composition of the city, with 85% of the population being white and 15% being black. This serves as our prior probability.

Second, we have information about the witness's ability to accurately identify race. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time, under conditions similar to the night of the attack.

However, the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as black. This is an additional piece of information that can be used to update our prior probability.

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error. This means that there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct and the attacker is actually black.

So, the updated probability that the attacker is black, based on both the racial composition of the city and the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}
