To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black as E. We know that E = 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can write the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as P(black) * 100% - E, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black as E * 85% + (1 - P(black)) * 15%.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the probability of the observed event (the witness saying the attacker is black) is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(observed_event) = P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness mistakes white for black)

We know that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, so we can set P(observed_event) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks).

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.8 = 0.8 * P(black) - 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) * 0.85

Solving for P(black), we find:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.26

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 26%.
