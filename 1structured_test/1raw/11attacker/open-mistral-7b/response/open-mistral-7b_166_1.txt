Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this case. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem is a principle of conditional probability that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W). We are given P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly if the attacker is black is P(B|identified_black), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly if the attacker is black is P(W|identified_black) = 1 - P(B|identified_black).

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly if the attacker is white is P(W|identified_black) = 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly if the attacker is white is P(B|identified_black) = 1 - P(W|identified_black) = 0.2.

The likelihood ratio LR is the ratio of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker correctly for each race. In this case, LR = P(B|identified_black) / P(W|identified_black) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our probability for the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

P(B|identified_black) = [P(identified_black|B) * P(B)] / [P(identified_black|B) * P(B) + P(identified_black|W) * P(W)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(B|identified_black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.12, or 12%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
