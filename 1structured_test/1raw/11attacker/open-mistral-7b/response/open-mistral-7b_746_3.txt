Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect but is more likely to correctly identify white people (80% accuracy), identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by the product of the prior probability of H and the likelihood of E given H, divided by the probability of E.

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of H, P(H), is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15% (0.15).

The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the accuracy of the witness in identifying black people, which is 80%.

The probability of E, P(E), is the sum of the probability of E given that the attacker is black (P(E|H)) and the probability of E given that the attacker is white (P(E|~H)), where ~H denotes that the attacker is not black.

Given that the witness is more likely to correctly identify white people (80% accuracy for whites and 20% accuracy for blacks), we can infer that P(E|~H) is lower than P(E|H). However, without specific numbers, we can't calculate it exactly.

So, we can write Bayes' theorem as:

P(H|E) = (P(H) * P(E|H)) / P(E)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.15 * 0.8) / P(E)

Since we don't have the exact value of P(E), we can't calculate the exact probability that the attacker is black. However, we can see that this probability is greater than 0.12 (0.15 * 0.8), which is the probability of the attacker being black based solely on the racial composition of the city. This means that the witness's testimony increases the probability that the attacker is black.

To get a rough estimate of this probability, we could make an assumption about P(E|~H) and calculate P(E). However, without more specific information, this would be just an approximation.

So, in summary, based on the information given, the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.12 but cannot be calculated exactly.
