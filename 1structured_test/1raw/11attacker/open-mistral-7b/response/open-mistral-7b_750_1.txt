Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is the witness's identification.

First, let's define the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the probability before considering any evidence. Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.15

Now, let's consider the likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black or white. From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

If the attacker is black, the witness is correct 80% of the time. So, the likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

If the attacker is white, the witness errs 20% of the time. So, the likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is white is 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. This can be done using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = [P(Witness's identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness's identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness's identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

Substituting the values we calculated earlier, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black and the likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black or white.

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race. If the witness is more likely to err when the attacker is white, or vice versa, this estimate would need to be adjusted accordingly.
