Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the event, times the prior probability of the event.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- ε: the witness's error (mistaking a white person for black)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(B|A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness mistakes a black person for white, given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|ε) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black, given that the witness errs)
- P(ε) = 0.2 (the prior probability of the witness's error, given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies race)

We can now calculate P(A|B) (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|ε) * P(ε)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.2 * 0.15] / [0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.2]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.172

So, our estimate is that there is a 17.2% probability that the attacker is black. This estimate takes into account the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the population.
