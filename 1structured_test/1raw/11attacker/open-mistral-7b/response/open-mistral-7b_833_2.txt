Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is 80% when judging race, and they incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time. However, we don't have information about whether the witness's error rate is the same for both white and black people, or if it's biased towards one race. Without this information, we can't adjust the witness's reliability rate.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Since we don't have enough information to adjust the witness's reliability rate, we'll use it as it is. The witness identified the attacker as black, which means they made a correct identification 80% of the time, given similar conditions.

Without knowing the witness's error rate for black people specifically, it's hard to be more precise than using the overall error rate of 20%. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the witness's reliability rate for identifying black people, which we don't know.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can't provide a strict probability estimate. The best we can do is say that there's a probability greater than 80% that the attacker is black, but less than 100%, since the witness might have made an error. However, without more information, this estimate is speculative and should be treated with caution.
