Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker, we can use the witness's error rate as a probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black.

In this case, the witness's error rate of 20% translates to a probability of 0.2 that the attacker is not black (given that the witness identified the attacker as black). Since the probability of an event and its complement are additive, the probability of the attacker being black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8}.
