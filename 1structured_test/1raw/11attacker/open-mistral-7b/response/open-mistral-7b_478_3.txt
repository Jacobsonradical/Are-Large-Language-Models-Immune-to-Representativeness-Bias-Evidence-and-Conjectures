To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the ethnic composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate was higher or lower when identifying black people specifically.

Given that 85% of the population is white, it might be assumed that the witness had more opportunities to observe and identify white people, and their error rate could be higher for black people. But without this information, we can't make such an assumption.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a precise estimate. However, we can give a range of possible probabilities.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is the same for both races, then the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (the minority race in the city). But if we assume that the witness's error rate is higher for black people, then the probability could be lower than 15%. Conversely, if the error rate is lower for black people, then the probability could be higher than 15%.

Therefore, the strict answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: Unable to provide a precise number, range: [0.15, 0.35]}
