Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to accurately identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.

The witness's error rate (20%) is included in this question, which is important because it allows us to account for potential false positives. However, since we are also given the racial composition of the city, we can use this information to calculate the probability of the attacker being black without relying solely on the witness's statement.

Let's break it down:

1. The probability of an attacker being black in the city as a whole is 15%.
2. The witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the total number of ways the witness could have identified the attacker:

a) The attacker is truly black, which would happen 15% of the time.
b) The attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified them as black, which would happen 85% * 0.20 = 17% of the time.

So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities:

Probability(black) + Probability(white misidentified as black) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness's statement is incorrect and that the attacker is actually white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, this means that when the witness identifies someone as black, there is a 20% chance that the person is actually white.

So, the probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black is 0.32 - 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.256

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.256, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
