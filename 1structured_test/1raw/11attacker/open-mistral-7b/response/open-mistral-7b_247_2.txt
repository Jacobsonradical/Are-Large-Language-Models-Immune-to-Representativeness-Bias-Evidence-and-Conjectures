To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

We have the following information:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's demographics: P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black, which is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race as black, which is given as 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's statement, which is given by the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A): P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Since we don't have the value of P(~A), which is the prior probability of the attacker not being black (1 - P(A) = 0.85), we cannot directly calculate P(B). However, we can solve for P(A|B) by rearranging Bayes' theorem to get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We can see that P(B|A) and P(A) are known, and we can calculate P(B) if we know P(~A). But without this information, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate.

However, we can still provide a rough estimate by assuming that the prior probability of the attacker not being black, P(~A), is also 0.15 (similar to P(A)). In this case, P(B) would be approximately 0.3 (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85), and P(A|B) would be approximately 0.53 (0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3).

Therefore, our best estimate, assuming an equal prior probability of the attacker being black or not black, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.53. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different, depending on the true value of P(~A).
