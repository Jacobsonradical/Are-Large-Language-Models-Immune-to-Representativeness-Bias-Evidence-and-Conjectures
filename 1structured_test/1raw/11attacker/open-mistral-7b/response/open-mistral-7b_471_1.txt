Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- H: The attacker is black
- π(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black (given in part A: 15%)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- π(E|H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (given in part B: 80%)
- π(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (1 minus the probability in part B: 20%)
- π(~H): Prior probability of the attacker not being black (given in part A: 85%)

Bayes' theorem states that:

π(H|E) = (π(E|H) * π(H)) / (π(E|H) * π(H) + π(E|~H) * π(~H))

Substituting the given values, we get:

π(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the probabilities, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

π(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.
