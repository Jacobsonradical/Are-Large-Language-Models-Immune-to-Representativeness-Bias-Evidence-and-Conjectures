To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, and the population is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's errors are random and unbiased, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is the same as the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black. This means that the witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time for both black and white people.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2.

However, since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 0.8.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is the same as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as white, which is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8.

In summary, {probability: 0.8} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
