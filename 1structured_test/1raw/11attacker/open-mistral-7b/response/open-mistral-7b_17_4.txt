Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification in this specific case. Since the witness could not see the attacker's face, we can't directly apply the 80% success rate from point 2 to this situation. But we can make an estimation based on the overall racial composition of the city.

Let's assume that, despite not being able to see the attacker's face, the witness made a decision based on other factors, such as height, build, or clothing, which in the best-case scenario would still be influenced by the racial composition of the city.

In this scenario, the probability of the attacker being black would be close to their representation in the city, which is 15%. However, considering the witness's error rate, we should adjust this probability slightly.

Let's calculate the expected number of errors:

- In a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we would expect the witness to see a white person about 85 times and a black person about 15 times in a large enough sample.
- Given the witness's 80% success rate, we would expect them to correctly identify the race 80% of the time, which means 0.8 * 85 = 68 correct identifications of whites and 0.8 * 15 = 12 correct identifications of blacks.
- This would leave us with 17 incorrect identifications of whites and 3 incorrect identifications of blacks.

Since the witness's statement is that the attacker was black, we can assume their error was an incorrect identification of a white person as black. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, would be the ratio of incorrect black identifications to the total number of incorrect identifications:

{probability: 3/17 â‰ˆ 0.176, which can be rounded to 17.6%}

This estimate suggests that, given the information provided, the attacker is likely to be black about 17.6% of the time, but it should be noted that this is a rough estimation based on assumptions. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not considered in this analysis.
