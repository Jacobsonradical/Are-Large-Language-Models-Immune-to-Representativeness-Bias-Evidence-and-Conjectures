Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's testimony

The prior probability of H (P(H)) is given in the first piece of information: P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

The likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)) is given in the second piece of information: P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

The likelihood of E given not H (P(E|~H)) is the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is white. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate P(E|~H) as follows:

P(E|~H) = P(~H) * P(E|~H) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.12 or 12%.
