Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The overall population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, regardless of the actual population composition.
3. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

Given these facts, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness making a mistake, which is 20%. So, the estimate would be:

{probability: 0.2}
