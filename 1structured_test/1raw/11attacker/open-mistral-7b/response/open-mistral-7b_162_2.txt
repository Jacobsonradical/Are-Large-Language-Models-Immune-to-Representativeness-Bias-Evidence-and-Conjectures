Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E as the evidence, which is the witness's statement

The prior probability of H, P(H), is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the probability that a random black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the likelihood of E given H is 0.2.

The likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|~H), is the probability that a random white person would be mistakenly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is the opposite of the probability of correctly identifying a white person, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can compute the posterior probability, P(H|E), using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.2) * (0.15) / [(0.2) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.227

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22.7%.
