Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the race of a black person 80% of the time.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which is given as 15%.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the identification, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time (when they mistake a white person for black), the probability of the evidence is:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white, which is the complement of P(E|H) = 20%. P(not H) is the probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.38

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.38 or 38%.
