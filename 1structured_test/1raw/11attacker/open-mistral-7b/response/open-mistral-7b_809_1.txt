Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black)

Since we don't have the value of P(E|~H), we can't directly calculate P(E). However, we can calculate P(E|H) / P(E) and then multiply by P(H) to get the final probability.

P(E|H) / P(E) = 0.8 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(E|H) / P(E) ≈ 0.8 / (0.12 + 0.04)
P(E|H) / P(E) ≈ 0.8 / 0.16
P(E|H) / P(E) ≈ 5

So, P(H|E) = P(E|H) / P(E) * P(H)
P(H|E) ≈ 0.15 * 5
P(H|E) ≈ 0.75

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
