To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
-  ~H: the attacker is not black (implies the attacker is white)
- E: the witness's identification of the attacker as black

The prior probability of H, P(H), is the proportion of black people in the city, which we know to be 15%.

The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. We know this probability from the information provided to be 0.8.

The likelihood of E given ~H, P(E|~H), is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

Calculating, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.27.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.27}
