To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's success rate to this specific case since we don't know the actual ethnicity distribution in the population the witness was tested on.

To make an estimate, we can assume that the population the witness was tested on has the same racial distribution as the city's population (85% white, 15% black). In this case, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that A is true given that B is true. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black given that they are actually black. This is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability of A being true, which is the probability that the attacker is black in the population.
- P(B) is the probability of B being true, which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race.

We don't have the exact value for P(B), but we can calculate it using the information we have. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and half of the people are black, we can expect the witness to correctly identify a black person as black 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 times. However, since the witness also incorrectly identifies a white person as black 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 times, the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black is 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5
= 0.12

So, our estimate is that there is a 12% probability that the attacker is black. However, this is an estimate based on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be different. It's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person they are observing, which may not be the case in reality.
