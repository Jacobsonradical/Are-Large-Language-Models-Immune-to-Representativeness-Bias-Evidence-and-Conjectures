The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. However, we do not have information about the race of the people the witness encountered during the 80% of the times they correctly identified race. If we assume that the distribution of races in the group of people the witness encountered matches the city's population distribution, then 85% of the people they correctly identified would be white.
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black (given that they are black) is 15% (population of blacks) * 20% (error rate).
5. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (given that they are black) is 100% - 15% = 85%.
6. Since we do not know the actual number of blacks in the population, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black. However, we can use the witness's accuracy to make an estimate.
7. If the attacker is black, they have a 85% chance of being correctly identified as such by the witness. Given the city's population distribution, there is a 15% probability of the attacker being black.
8. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the city's population distribution, is 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.1275, or approximately 12.75%.
