Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, where they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

However, there's an important caveat: the witness made an error in this specific case, identifying the attacker as black. This error increases the overall probability that the attacker is white, given the racial composition of the city.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. The probability that the attacker is black given the racial composition of the city is 15% or 0.15.
2. The probability that the witness makes a mistake and identifies a white person as black is 20% (from the witness's reliability data).
3. Since the witness made an error, the probability that the attacker is actually white is the probability of the witness making a mistake times the probability of the attacker being white. This is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can find the overall probability that the attacker is black by subtracting the probability that the attacker is white from 1:

1 - 0.17 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error and the racial composition of the city, is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
