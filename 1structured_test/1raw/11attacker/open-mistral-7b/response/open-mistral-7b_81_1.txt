To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Let's assume that the attacker's race is random, meaning the probability of an attacker being white or black is the same as their proportion in the city's population.

1. If the attacker was white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black would be the error rate of 20%.
2. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the total probability of their identification being correct or incorrect.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of attacker being white: 0.85 (85%)
2. Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black: 0.2 (20%)
3. Probability of attacker being black and witnessed correctly: 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 (80%) = 0.12
4. Total probability of witness correctly identifying the attacker's race: 0.12 (correctly identifying black) + 0.02 (mistakenly identifying white) = 0.14

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
