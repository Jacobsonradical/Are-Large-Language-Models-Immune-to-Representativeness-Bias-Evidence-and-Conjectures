To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen, there's a chance that the witness could have made an error in identifying the attacker as black.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black is 0.2 * P(black).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that the actual attacker is either black (P(black)) or the witness made an error (0.2 * P(black)). The total probability of these two events is P(black) + 0.2 * P(black) = 1.2 * P(black) - 0.2 * P(black) = 1.0 * P(black).

However, we know from the city's racial composition that the actual probability of an attacker being black is 0.15. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

1.0 * P(black) = 0.15

Solving for P(black), we get P(black) = 0.15.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}
