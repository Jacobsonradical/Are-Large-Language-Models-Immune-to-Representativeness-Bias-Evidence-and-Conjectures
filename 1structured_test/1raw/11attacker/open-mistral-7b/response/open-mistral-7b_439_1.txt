To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the population, then the probability of the witness erring (i.e., identifying a white person as black) is 20%.

Given this information, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is the probability of the attacker actually being black times the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as black, plus the probability of the witness erring (identifying a white person as black) times the probability of the attacker being white.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness errs and identifies attacker as black)

Using the given information, we can calculate these probabilities:

P(attacker is black) = 15% = 0.15
P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black) = 0.80
P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 85% = 0.85
P(witness errs and identifies attacker as black) = 0.20

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.29 or 29%.
