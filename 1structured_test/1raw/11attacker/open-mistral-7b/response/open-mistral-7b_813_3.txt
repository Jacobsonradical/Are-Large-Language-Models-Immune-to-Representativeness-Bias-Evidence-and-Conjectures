To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the population: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct if the attacker is black, and the probability of the witness's identification being correct if the attacker is white.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is 20%. So, P(W|Berr) = 0.2.

Similarly, given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is 0.8. So, P(B|Bcorr) = 0.8.

We want to find P(B|B identified), which is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|B identified) = P(B identified|B) * P(B) / P(B identified)

Given the racial composition of the population, P(B) = 0.15.

Now we need to find P(B identified|B), which is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B identified|B) = 0.8.

To find P(B identified), we need to consider both the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black:

P(B identified) = P(B identified|B) * P(B) + P(B identified|Werr) * P(W)

We know that P(B identified|Werr) = 0.2, and P(W) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B identified):

P(B identified) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|B identified):

P(B|B identified) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.479

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
