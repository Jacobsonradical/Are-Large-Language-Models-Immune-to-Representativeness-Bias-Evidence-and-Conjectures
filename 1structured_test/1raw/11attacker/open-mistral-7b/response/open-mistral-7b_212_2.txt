Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We have the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (proportion of white people in the city)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was white)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.12 (the total probability of the witness making that identification)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / (0.12) = 0.6667 (approximately 66.67%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 66.67%.
