Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

First, let's consider the racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that the likelihood of a random person in the city being black is 0.15 or 15%.

However, we also have information about the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him. The probability of this happening is the witness's accuracy rate for black people, which is 0.8.
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified him as black. The probability of this happening is the witness's error rate for white people, which is 0.2 * 0.85 (the probability of randomly encountering a white person in the city) = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of scenario 1 plus the probability of scenario 2 multiplied by the probability that the witness is wrong, which is 0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.884 or approximately 88.4%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.884}.
