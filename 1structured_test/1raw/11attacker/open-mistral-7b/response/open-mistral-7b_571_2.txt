Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness's statement) = [P(witness's statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness's statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's statement | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

We are given that P(witness's statement | attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time) and P(witness's statement | attacker is white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (the attacker is black 15% of the time)
P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (the attacker is white 85% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.235 or 23.5%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.235} or 23.5%.
