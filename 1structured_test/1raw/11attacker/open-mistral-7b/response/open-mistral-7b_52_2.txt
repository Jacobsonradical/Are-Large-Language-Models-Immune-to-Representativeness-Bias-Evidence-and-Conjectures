Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's statement) is given by the city's demographic data: P(A) = 0.15.

The likelihood of E given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is black) is given by the witness's accuracy rate: P(E|A) = 0.8.

The likelihood of E given not-A (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is not black) is given by the witness's error rate: P(E|not-A) = 0.2.

The prior probability of not-A (the probability of the attacker being white before considering the witness's statement) is P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the demographic data and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.
