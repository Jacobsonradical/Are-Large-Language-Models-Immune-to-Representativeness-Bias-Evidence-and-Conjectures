Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability of an event based on new evidence.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, given the demographics of the city, is 15%. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20%. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The likelihood of this evidence given that the attacker is black is 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case). The likelihood of this evidence given that the attacker is white is 0.20 (since the witness mistakenly identified the white attacker as black 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's ID) = [P(Witness's ID | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness's ID | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness's ID | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's ID) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(Attacker is black | Witness's ID) â‰ˆ 0.28

So, given the witness's identification and the demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 28%.
