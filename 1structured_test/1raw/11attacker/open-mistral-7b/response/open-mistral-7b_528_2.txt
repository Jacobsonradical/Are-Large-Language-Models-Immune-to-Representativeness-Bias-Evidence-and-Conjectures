Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness's testimony that the attacker is black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There's a chance that the witness made an error in their judgment.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error:

1. The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white is 20%.
2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Now let's calculate the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black:

1. The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black is 20%.
2. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (or 3%).

Since we don't know whether the witness erred or not, we should consider both possibilities: the witness was correct and the attacker is black, and the witness was incorrect and the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is black is 0.80 (the witness's reliability). So the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness was correct is 0.80.

The probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is white is 0.80 as well (the witness's reliability, but this time for erring). So the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness was incorrect is 0.80.

Now, let's calculate the overall probabilities:

1. The probability that the witness was correct is the probability of the attacker being black * the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is black + the probability of the attacker being white * the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is white.
2. This can be calculated as 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city, is approximately 29%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify races remains constant, which may not be the case in real-world situations.
