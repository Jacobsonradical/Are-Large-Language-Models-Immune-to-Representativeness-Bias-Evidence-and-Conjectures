Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory dealing with conditional probabilities and is often used in situations like this.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the event that the attacker is black, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
3. P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black = 0.2 (from the first piece of information)
4. P(A) + P(~A) = 1, where ~A represents the event that the attacker is not black
5. P(~A) = 1 - P(A)
6. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

We are given P(B|A) and P(B|~A), so we can rearrange the Bayes' theorem equation to solve for P(A):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Now we can substitute the known values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))]

To solve for P(A), we can set up an equation and solve it numerically or graphically. However, without additional information, we cannot provide an exact numerical value.

So, given the information provided, we cannot provide a strict answer in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. But we can say that based on the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, the attacker is more likely to be black than white, but the exact probability cannot be determined with the given information.
