Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(Attacker is Black) as the probability that the attacker is black, which we want to find.
- P(Witness identifies as Black | Attacker is Black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8.
- P(Witness identifies as Black | Attacker is White) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which can be calculated as 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.18 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).
- P(Attacker is White) as the probability that the attacker is white, which is given as 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(Attacker is Black) = [P(Witness identifies as Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness identifies as Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness identifies as Black) * P(Attacker is White) + P(Witness identifies as Not Black) * P(Attacker is White)].

Since the witness did not identify the attacker's race, we don't have P(Witness identifies as Not Black) in this case. However, we can assume it to be equal to the error rate, which is 0.2.

Substituting the given values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is Black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.18 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.33 = 0.3636

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
