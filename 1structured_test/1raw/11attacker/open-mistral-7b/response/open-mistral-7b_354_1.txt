Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, with 85% white and 15% black residents.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which they do correctly 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the city's demographics and the reliability of the witness's observations. The witness's statement does not imply that they observed the attacker in a setting where they could accurately identify their race. Instead, the witness's statement refers to their performance in a different situation, which is a different context from the night of the attack.

Since we don't have enough information to reasonably estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement, we can only use the city's demographics as a baseline.

{probability: 0.15, the attacker is likely 15% black according to the city's demographics}
