To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the population in the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we do not have any information about the race of the attacker, we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black is the witness's correct identification rate. So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

So, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black when it's actually a white person is 0.17. To find the overall probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification, we need to subtract this probability from the witness's correct identification rate: 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63 (or 63%).

However, we made an assumption that the witness's error rate of identifying a white person as black (0.17) is the same for a black person as white. In reality, this might not be the case, and the error rate for identifying a black person as white might be higher. If this is the case, the probability of the attacker being black would be lower than 0.63.

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.63 (or 63%). However, this estimate is sensitive to the assumption about the error rate of identifying a black person as white. A more accurate estimate would require additional information.
