To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information about whether the witness made a correct or incorrect identification in this specific case, we can't directly apply the 80% or 20% to our estimate. However, if we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of each individual they observe, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can estimate from the city's racial composition: P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

Let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black. Given the witness's accuracy of 80%, we have P(B|A) = 0.8.

Let P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is not black. Given the witness's accuracy of 80% and the fact that 85% of the population is white, we can estimate P(B|~A) to be around 0.68 (85% * 0.8).

Finally, let P(B) be the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is black. Since we don't have any information about whether the witness's identification was correct, we can't directly calculate this probability. However, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(B) as the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification and making an incorrect identification: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.68 * 0.85 = 0.21 + 0.58 = 0.8.

Given these calculations, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black to be:

{probability: 0.15 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)} = {probability: 0.15 / 0.6} = {probability: 0.25}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.25 or 25%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of each individual they observe and that the witness made a correct identification in this specific case. However, without more information, it's impossible to make a more precise estimate.
