Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- W: the witness's error rate (20%)
- P(W): the probability that the witness is wrong (W)
- P(B): the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B): the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (1 - W)
- P(B|W): the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black given that they are wrong (P(B) * P(W|B) / [P(B) * P(W|B) + P(W) * P(~B|W)])
- P(~B): the probability that the attacker is not black (1 - P(B))
- P(~B|W): the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black given that they are wrong (P(~B) * P(~B|W) / [P(B) * P(W|B) + P(W) * P(~B|W)])

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is P(B|W) = (1 - W) / [(1 - W) / P(B) + W / P(~B)]

Now, we can use the information about the racial composition of the city to estimate P(B) and P(~B):

P(B) = 0.15
P(~B) = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B|W), we get:

P(B|W) = (1 - 0.2) / [(1 - 0.2) / 0.15 + 0.2 / 0.85]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.34

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
