Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be:

{
  "probability": 0.8
}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as black.
3. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race and found that they correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that there was a 0.80 chance that they were correct (80% chance of correctly identifying a black person).
5. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black (20% chance of error).
6. Since 85% of the population is white, there is a higher likelihood that the witness made an error and misidentified a white person as black.
7. To account for this possibility, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a white person as black, and then subtract that probability from the initial probability of the witness being correct.
8. To do this, we can use the formula for conditional probability (P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)): P(white person | witness's identification) = 0.20 * 0.85 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.047
9. Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification: P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(witness's identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness's identification) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.72
10. However, we need to account for the possibility of the witness's error, so we subtract the probability of the witness making an error: P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black | witness's identification) - P(white person | witness's identification) = 0.72 - 0.047 = 0.673
11. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.673 or 67.3%.
