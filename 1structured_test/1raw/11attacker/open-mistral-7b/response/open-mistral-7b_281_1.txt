To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the accuracy of the witness in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

We have the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making this observation, regardless of whether the attacker is black or not)

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.6667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 66.67%. This means that there is a 66.67% chance that the attacker is black and a 33.33% chance that the attacker is white, based on this information.
