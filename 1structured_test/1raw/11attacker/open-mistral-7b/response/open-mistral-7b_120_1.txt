Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if this identification was correct or an error. Since we don't have additional information, we can't determine if the attacker is actually black or if the witness made an error. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a probability estimate based on this information.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
