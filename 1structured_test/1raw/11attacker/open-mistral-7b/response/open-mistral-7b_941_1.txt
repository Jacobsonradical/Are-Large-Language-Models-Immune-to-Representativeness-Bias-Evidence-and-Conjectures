To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided in both the witness's ability to identify race and the demographics of the city.

1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. This means that out of 100 people, the witness would correctly identify 80 as black or white and mistakenly identify 20 as the opposite race.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This means that if a random person is chosen from the city, there is an 85% chance they are white and a 15% chance they are black.

The witness saw the attacker at night, making it unlikely that they could accurately determine the attacker's race with 100% certainty. However, we can still use the witness's error rate to adjust the initial probability that the attacker is black based on the city's demographics.

Since the witness has a 20% error rate, there is a 20% chance that they mistakenly identified a white person as black. This means that if the attacker were white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

On the other hand, there is a 100% - 20% = 80% chance that the witness would correctly identify a black person as black. This means that if the attacker were black, the witness would correctly identify them as such 80% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use this information to adjust the initial probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's error rate. In other words, we can treat the witness's identification as evidence that the attacker is likely to be black, but we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

Since the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying black people as black, we can write the equation:

P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 = Witness's identification

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we can set this equation equal to 1:

P(black) * 0.8 = 1

Now, we need to solve for P(black):

P(black) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

However, since the probability of an event must be a number between 0 and 1, we need to adjust our estimate to account for the witness's error rate. Given that the witness has a 20% error rate in identifying race, we can expect that if the attacker were white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

To account for this error rate, we can add the probability of the witness's error to our initial estimate:

P(black) = 1.25 + 0.2 = 1.45

To adjust this estimate to a value between 0 and 1, we can use the formula for the complement of a probability:

P(black) = 1 - P(white) = 1 - (1 - P(black)) = 2 * P(black) - 1

Substituting our initial estimate of P(black) = 1.45, we get:

P(black) = 2 * 1.45 - 1 = 0.87

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.87, or 87%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's ability to identify race and the demographics of the city, while accounting for the possibility that the witness made an error.
