To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the composition of the population in the city.

The witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker could be either black or white, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a randomly chosen person being white is 0.85. The probability of a randomly chosen person being black is therefore 0.15 (since the total probability of all possible outcomes must be 1).

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification of a black person as such is an error is 0.2. This means that the probability that the witness's identification of a black person is correct is 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness's identification being correct times the probability of a randomly chosen person being black. This can be calculated as 0.6 * 0.15 = 0.09, or 9%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person being identified. In reality, this may not be the case, and the accuracy of the witness's identification may depend on other factors, such as the lighting conditions, the distance to the person, and the witness's familiarity with different racial groups.

Therefore, while this calculation provides an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, it should be interpreted with caution and treated as a rough approximation, rather than a definitive answer.

{probability: 0.09, please note that this is a rough estimate and may not reflect the true probability due to potential biases in the witness's ability to identify race}
