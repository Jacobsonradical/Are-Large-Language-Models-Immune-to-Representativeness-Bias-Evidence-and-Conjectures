Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this witness's accuracy applies to this specific attack situation.

We do have information about the racial composition of the city, with 85% being white and 15% being black. If we assume that the witness's accuracy and error rate are independent of the racial composition of the population, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A and the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%, and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 80%. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is the error rate, which is 20%.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.22

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22%.
