Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, times the prior probability of event A. In this case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (from information b). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Calculating this gives a probability of 0.24 or 24%.
