Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have any direct information about the attacker's race. The witness's identification is an estimate, not definitive proof.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population, then the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's identification introduces another probability. The witness incorrectly identified a black person as white 20% of the time. If the actual attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as black.

On the other hand, if the actual attacker is black, there is only a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as white (given the witness's 80% accuracy rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider the two scenarios:

1) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified them. Probability of this scenario: 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

2) The attacker is actually white, and the witness incorrectly identified them as black. Probability of this scenario: 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (since there is a 15% chance of a white person being in the city and a 20% chance of the witness incorrectly identifying them as black).

The total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is the sum of these two scenarios: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

However, this probability is based on the assumption that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population. In reality, the attacker might not be randomly chosen, and the witness's identification might not be perfect. Therefore, this probability should be considered as an estimate, not a definitive answer.

{probability: 0.83, please note that this is an estimate and not a definitive probability}
