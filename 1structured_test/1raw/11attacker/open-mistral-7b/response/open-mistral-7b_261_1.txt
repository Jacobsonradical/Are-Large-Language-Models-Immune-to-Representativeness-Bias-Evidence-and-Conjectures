To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness description and population statistics)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)):
   Since we don't have any information about the attacker's race before the incident, our prior belief should be based on the city's demographics. From point b, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

2. Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)):
   The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race 20% of the time, so they correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time. Given that the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as black is 0.8.

3. Probability of the evidence (P(E)):
   Since we don't have specific information about the witness's accuracy in a single instance, we can't calculate this directly. However, we know that if the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time, and if the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify them as black 80% of the time. So, the probability of the evidence (E) is the weighted sum of P(E|H=white) and P(E|H=black), where the weights are the probabilities of the attacker being white and black, respectively.

   We can calculate P(E|H=white) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is white is P(E|H=white) * P(H=white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

   The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is black is P(E|H=black) * P(H=black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

   Since P(E) = P(E|H=white) * P(H=white) + P(E|H=black) * P(H=black), P(E) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness description and population statistics:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, based on the witness description and the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.52 (52%).
