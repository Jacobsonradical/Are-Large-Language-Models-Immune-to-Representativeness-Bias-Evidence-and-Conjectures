Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:
1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black in this instance.
4. However, we don't have enough information to determine if this was an error or if the attacker truly is black.

Therefore, due to the lack of sufficient information, it's not possible to provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
