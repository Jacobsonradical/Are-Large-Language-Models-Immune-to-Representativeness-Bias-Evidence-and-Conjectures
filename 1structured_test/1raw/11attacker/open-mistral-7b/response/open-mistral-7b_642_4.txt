Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability (P(H)) of the attacker being black is given as 15% in the first piece of information. The likelihood (P(E|H)) of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is given as 80% in the second piece of information.

The probability of the witness making a mistake (P(E|~H)) when the attacker is white is given as 20% in the second piece of information. The prior probability of the attacker being white (P(~H)) is 1 - P(H) = 85%.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E)) of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(H) * P(E|H)] / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.15 * 0.8] / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 12%.
