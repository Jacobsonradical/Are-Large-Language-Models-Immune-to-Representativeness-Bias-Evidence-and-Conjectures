Based on the provided information, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

The probability of the attacker being black can be estimated by considering the witness's error rate and the city's population distribution.

If the attacker was white, the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as black would be the error rate, 0.20.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 1 minus the probability of the witness making an error, given that the attacker is white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

1 - 0.20 = 0.80

The final answer is: {probability: 0.80} or 80% probability that the attacker is black.
