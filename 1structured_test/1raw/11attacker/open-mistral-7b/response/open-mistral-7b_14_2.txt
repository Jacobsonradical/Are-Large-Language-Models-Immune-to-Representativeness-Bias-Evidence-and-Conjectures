The given information suggests that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is typically accurate 80% of the time in identifying race and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

The witness's observation should be considered as evidence, but it's important to take into account the potential for error. The probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's statement, can be calculated as the product of the overall probability that an attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black given that he is indeed black.

The probability that an attacker is black is 15% (from information a). The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black given that he is indeed black is 0.8 (from information b).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness's statement also introduces the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race. If the witness made an error, the attacker is likely to be white. The probability that the witness made an error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's statement, is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black or white, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probabilities that the attacker is black and the attacker is white, given the witness's statement, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

But since the witness's statement introduces the possibility of error, it seems more reasonable to focus on the probabilities of the attacker being black or white without considering the witness's statement, which would give us 0.15 or 15% for the attacker being black and 0.85 or 85% for the attacker being white.

Therefore, based on the available information without considering the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
