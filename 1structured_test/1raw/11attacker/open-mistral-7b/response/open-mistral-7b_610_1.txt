To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify it 80% of the time. Since 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the expected proportion of black people the witness would identify as black, even if the attacker was actually white:

Expected proportion of correct black identifications = Proportion of black people * Proportion of correct identifications
                                                             = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                             = 0.12

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. This means that either the witness was correct, or they made an error. Since we know the witness made errors 20% of the time, the probability that they were correct in this case is 1 - the probability of error:

Probability that the witness was correct = 1 - Probability of error
                                             = 1 - 0.2
                                             = 0.8

But we also know that the expected proportion of correct black identifications is 0.12. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that the actual probability of the attacker being black must be greater than the expected probability. We can calculate this probability as follows:

Probability that the attacker is black = Expected proportion of correct black identifications * Probability that the witness was correct
                                           = 0.12 * 0.8
                                           = 0.096

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it is likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is likely less than 0.12, but we cannot calculate an exact value without more information.

Final answer: {probability: less than 0.12, but cannot be precisely calculated}
