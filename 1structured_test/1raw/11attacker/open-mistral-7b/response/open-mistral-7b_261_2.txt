Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to identify race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate.
2. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the population of attackers in the city is also representative of the city's population (85% white, 15% black). Then, the probability of the witness being correct in identifying the attacker as black is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness might have made an error. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, was actually mistaken and the attacker is actually white.

Given that the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the actual probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct minus the probability of the witness being incorrect and making a mistake:

0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63 (63%)

So, based on this information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.63.
