Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the witness making a correct identification as P(w|B) (given that the attacker is black). Similarly, let's denote the probability of the attacker not being black as P(not B), and the probability of the witness making a mistake (identifying a white person as black) as P(w|not B) (given that the attacker is not black).

From the information given, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% must be black), P(w|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time), and P(w|not B) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|w) = [P(w|B) * P(B)] / [P(w|B) * P(B) + P(w|not B) * P(not B)].

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(B|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we find that P(B|w) â‰ˆ 0.274 (27.4%).

So, based on the witness's identification and the given racial demographics of the city, there is approximately a 27.4% chance that the attacker is black. This estimate takes into account both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.
