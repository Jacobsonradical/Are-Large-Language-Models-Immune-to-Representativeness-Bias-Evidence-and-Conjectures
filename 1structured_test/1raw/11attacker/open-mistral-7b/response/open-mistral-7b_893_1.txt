Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker. We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8.

Let P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker, weighted by the probabilities of those events.

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a white attacker 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.2925

To find P(A), we can use the total probability rule, which states that the probability of any event is the sum of the probabilities of its subsets. In this case, the sum of the probabilities of the attacker being black and being white is 1:

P(A) + P(not A) = 1
P(A) = 1 - P(not A)

Given that 85% of the population is white, P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.15. So:

P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.85 / 0.2925 â‰ˆ 0.68

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.68. This means that, based on the provided information, there is a 68% chance that the attacker is black.
