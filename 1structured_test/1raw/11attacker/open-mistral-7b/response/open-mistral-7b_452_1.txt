Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfectly reliable, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to take into account both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person (white in this case)

We know from the information given that P(B) = 0.15 (the population percentage of black people), P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's success rate in identifying black people), and P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying non-black people).

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black (P(W|B)), is equal to the witness's success rate in identifying black people. Similarly, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (P(W|~B)), is equal to the witness's error rate in identifying non-black people.

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race (P(W)), is the sum of these two probabilities: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * (1 - P(B)).

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, and the attacker is actually black (P(B|W)) is the probability of both events happening, which we can calculate as P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W).

So, to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to find P(B|W).

Using the given values, we calculate: P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|~B) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.15, and P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.28.

Then, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.464.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.464 or 46.4%.
