The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, this could mean they were correct or they made an error. Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error.

Let's denote:
- E: event of witness making an error
- W: event of the attacker being white
- B: event of the attacker being black

We know that P(E) = 0.2, P(W) = 0.85, and P(B) = 0.15.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black and making an error is P(E ∩ B). We can compute this as follows:

P(E ∩ B) = P(E) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume the event E ∩ B has occurred. So, the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified him as black, is the probability of this event occurring divided by the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(B | E ∩ B) = P(E ∩ B) / P(E)

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.
