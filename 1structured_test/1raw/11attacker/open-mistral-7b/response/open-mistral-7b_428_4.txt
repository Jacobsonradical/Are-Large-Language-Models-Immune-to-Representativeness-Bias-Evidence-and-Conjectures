Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we do not have any direct information about how this witness's performance might be affected by the specific circumstances of the attack.

The city's demographics are 85% white and 15% black. If the witness's performance is independent of the attack's circumstances, we could argue that the attacker is more likely to be white because they make up a larger portion of the city's population.

However, the witness's testimony suggests that they have a higher accuracy rate for identifying black people. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black, we can make an estimate based on the witness's track record.

To do this, we can weight the witness's testimony by the probability of a random person being black in the city (15%) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (80%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person is then 20%.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony, is 15% * 80% = 0.12 or 12%.

However, it's important to note that this is a simplification and may not fully take into account the specific circumstances of the attack or the witness's performance in this specific case. Therefore, this estimate should be treated as an approximation.
