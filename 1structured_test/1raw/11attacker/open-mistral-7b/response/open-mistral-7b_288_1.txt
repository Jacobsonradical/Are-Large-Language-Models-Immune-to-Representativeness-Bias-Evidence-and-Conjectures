Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any information about whether the witness's error was in this case or not.

To make an estimate, we could assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between the two races. This means that 20% of the time, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black, and 20% of the time, the witness would incorrectly identify a black person as white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85. If the witness's error rate is evenly distributed, this means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and there's a 17% chance that the witness made a mistake and identified a white person as black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as 1 minus the probability of the witness making a mistake.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.17 = {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between the two races, which might not be the case in reality. Therefore, this is just an approximation and the actual probability could be different.
