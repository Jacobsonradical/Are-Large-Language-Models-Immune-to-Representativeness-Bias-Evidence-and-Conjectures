To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the race distribution in the sample used to assess the witness's ability is the same as the racial demographics in the city (as it was not specified otherwise), then the witness's error rate of 20% can be interpreted as an error rate for both white and black people.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. The witness's error rate of 0.2 implies a probability of 0.2 for the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Similarly, given that 15% of the population in the city is black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. The witness's error rate of 0.2 implies a probability of 0.2 for the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black.

{probability: 0.8}

This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is the same in real-world conditions as it was in the controlled conditions used to assess their ability. If the witness's ability is less reliable in real-world conditions, the probability that the attacker is black would be lower. If the witness's ability is more reliable in real-world conditions, the probability that the attacker is black would be higher.
