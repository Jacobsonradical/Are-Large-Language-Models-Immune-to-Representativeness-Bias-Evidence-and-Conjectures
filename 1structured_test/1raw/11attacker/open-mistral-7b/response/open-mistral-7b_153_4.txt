To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's break it down:

1. Let A be the event that the attacker is black and E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
3. P(E|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.8.
4. P(E|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a randomly chosen person being white is 0.85. Given this, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(E|not A) = 0.17.
5. P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85] = 0.12.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the given information and assumptions, and real-world scenarios may involve additional factors that could impact the probability.
