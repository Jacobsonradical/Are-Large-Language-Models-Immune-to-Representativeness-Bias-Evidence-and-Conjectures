To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Given that the city has an 85% white population and a 15% black population, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white:

Expected incorrect identifications of black as white = (Witness error rate) * (Number of black people) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

However, the witness also makes incorrect identifications of white people as black, but those do not affect our estimate of the attacker's race. So, we only need to consider the expected number of times the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white.

Since there are more white people in the city, the witness is more likely to encounter them. Therefore, the probability that the witness sees a black person and incorrectly identifies them as white is less than the probability that they see a white person and incorrectly identify them as black. This means that the actual number of incorrect identifications of black people as white is likely higher than 0.03.

However, without more information, we cannot accurately calculate this number. Therefore, we can only provide a lower bound for the probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: 0.15, please note that the actual probability might be higher}
