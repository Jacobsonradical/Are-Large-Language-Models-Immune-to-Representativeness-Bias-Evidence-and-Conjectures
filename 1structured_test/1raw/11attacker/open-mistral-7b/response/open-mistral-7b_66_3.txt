Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness, however, is not perfectly reliable, as they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can consider the probability of the witness making a correct identification (the attacker is black) and the probability of the witness making a mistake (the attacker is white).

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, we can also express P(W|B) as 1 - P(W|W), where P(W|W) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate P(W|W) as follows:

1. The probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85.
2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies this person as white is P(W|W) = 0.8 (as given in the information).
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is P(B|W) = 1 - P(W|W) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, let's calculate P(B):

1. The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is P(W|B) = 0.8, as given in the information.
2. The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is P(W|W) = 0.2 (calculated above).
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we have the event W ∩ (B or W) = W, where W is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, and B and W are the events that the attacker is black and white, respectively.
4. The probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, P(B|W), can be calculated as the ratio of the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (P(W|B) * P(B)) to the probability of the witness identifying a black or white person as black (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W)):
   P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / ((P(W|B) * P(B)) + (P(W|W) * P(W)))

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.4138} or approximately 41.38%.
