To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness misidentified the attacker as black. This means the witness erred in 20% of their cases, which corresponds to incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. If the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black in this situation is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness did identify the attacker as black, it means the attacker must be one of the 15% of the population that is black. The probability of this happening is simply the proportion of the population that is black, which is 0.15.

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. The probability of this happening is 0.17, as calculated above.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, or 32%}

This estimate suggests a slightly higher probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city, but the actual probability is still slightly higher that the attacker is black. It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information, and real-world scenarios may involve additional factors that could impact the actual probability.
