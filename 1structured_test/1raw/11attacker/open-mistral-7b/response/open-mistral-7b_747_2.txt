To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's statement).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is not black (white in this case)
- P(B) + P(~B) = 1, as the attacker must be either black or not black

Given the information in the problem, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.5 (given that the witness's error rate is 20%).

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]
        = 0.12 / 0.245
        â‰ˆ 0.487

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.49 or 49%.
