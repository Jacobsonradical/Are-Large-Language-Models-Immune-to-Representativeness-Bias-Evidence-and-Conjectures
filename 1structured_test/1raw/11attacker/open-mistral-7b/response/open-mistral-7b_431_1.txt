Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black)
- P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.13 (the probability of the witness making such an identification, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.13 â‰ˆ 0.615

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.615 or 61.5%.
