To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time and correctly identifies race 80% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are distributed equally between identifying whites as blacks and vice versa, then the witness's correct identification rate for blacks is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness's identification is not the only factor to consider. We also need to take into account the racial demographics of the city, which are 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, is 0.15 (the proportion of blacks in the city).
2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 0.12 (the witness's correct identification rate for blacks).
3. The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, is 0 (since the witness never incorrectly identifies a white person as black).

The total probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as the sum of these two probabilities weighted by their likelihoods:

probability = (probability given correct identification) * (probability of correct identification) + (probability given incorrect identification) * (probability of incorrect identification)

probability = (0.15) * (0.12) + (0) * (0.20) = 0.018 or 1.8%

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's errors are distributed equally between identifying whites as blacks and vice versa, which may not be the case. In reality, the probability that the attacker is black may be higher than 1.8%.
