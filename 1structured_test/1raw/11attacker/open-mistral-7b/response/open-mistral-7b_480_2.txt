To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, there's a chance that the witness might have mistakenly identified the attacker's race.

Let's assume that the actual race of the attacker is either black or white, and the witness errs by calling a white person black or a black person white. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is the same as the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Given the witness's ability to judge race, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black (P(err|black)) is 20%. Similarly, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white (P(err|white)) is 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually white is P(err|black) = 0.20. The probability that the attacker is black is then P(black) = 1 - P(err|black) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, we also need to consider the racial demographics of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it's more likely for a random person in the city to be white than black. This fact might influence the witness's perception.

To incorporate this information, let's denote the actual probability of the attacker being black as P(black|witness's statement). Given the witness's statement, it's more likely that the attacker is black if the city has a higher percentage of black people. So, we can write:

P(black|witness's statement) = P(black) * P(witness's statement|black) + P(not black) * P(witness's statement|not black)

We know that P(black) = 0.80, P(not black) = 0.20, P(witness's statement|black) = 0.80 (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the attacker is black), and P(witness's statement|not black) = 0.20 (since the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the attacker is not black).

So,

P(black|witness's statement) = 0.80 * 0.80 + 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.64

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.64. This means there's a 64% chance that the attacker is black and a 36% chance that the attacker is white.
