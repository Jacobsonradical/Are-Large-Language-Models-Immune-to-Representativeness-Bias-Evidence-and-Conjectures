To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is not black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white)

To find P(E), we need to calculate the probability of the witness making that identification, regardless of the race of the attacker. We can do this by weighting P(E|H) and P(E|~H) by the probabilities of each hypothesis:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.4

So, given the evidence of the witness's identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
