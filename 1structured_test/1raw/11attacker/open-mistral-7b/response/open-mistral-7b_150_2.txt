To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is not black (white)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (white), which is 1 - P(B)

We are given that:
- P(B) = Unknown (the probability we want to estimate)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the information in "a")
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (as P(W|B) = 1 - P(W|~B))
- P(~B) = 0.85 (from the information in "b")

We are also given that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we have the evidence W.

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * P(B)) / [(0.8 * P(B)) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

To solve for P(B), we can rearrange the equation to get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * (P(B) / (0.8 * P(B) + 0.17))

Since we cannot know the exact value of P(B), we can only provide an estimate. Let's assume that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is not affected by the attacker's race and is a good representation of the actual population distribution. In this case, we can estimate P(B) to be equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (from the information in "b").

Substituting P(B) = 0.15 into the equation, we get:

P(B|W) ≈ 0.8 * (0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17))
P(B|W) ≈ 0.32

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
