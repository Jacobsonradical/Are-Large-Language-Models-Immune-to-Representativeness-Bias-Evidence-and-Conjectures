Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- W as the event that the witness is observing a black person.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified black person 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified black person 20% of the time)
- P(B|A) = P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified black attacker)
- P(B|not A) = P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified black attacker)

Calculating P(A|B) (probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.24

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24%.
