Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B).

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified a black person as the attacker.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (the witness is 100% accurate when the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is not black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not black)

We don't have the total number of people the witness tested, so we can't calculate the exact value of P(B), but we can make an assumption that the witness's observations are independent events. In this case, P(B) would be the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person (P(B|~A) * P(~A)).

However, since we don't have the exact values for P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|~A) * P(~A), we can't calculate an exact probability. Instead, we can provide an estimate based on the given values:

{probability: 0.92, the witness's high accuracy in identifying black people and the fact that the majority of the population is white suggest that the attacker is likely black, but the exact probability cannot be calculated without more information.}
