Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, has an error rate of 20% when identifying race. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
   b) The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.
4. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we need to consider both scenarios and their probabilities.
5. The probability of the first scenario (a) is the probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
6. The probability of the second scenario (b) is the probability of the attacker being white and the witness making a mistake. This can be calculated as the probability of the attacker being white times the error rate of the witness.
7. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.
8. The error rate of the witness is 0.20.
9. Therefore, the probability of the second scenario (b) is 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.20 (witness error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%).
10. To find the probability of the first scenario (a), we subtract the probability of the second scenario (b) from 1: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
