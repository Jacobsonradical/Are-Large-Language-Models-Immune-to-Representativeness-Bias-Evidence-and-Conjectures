To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the witness's accuracy and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the witness encountered an attacker of each race equally often (which is not necessarily the case, but it simplifies the calculation). Then, if the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. Conversely, if the attacker was black, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as white 20% of the time.

Thus, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black (given that the attacker is indeed black) is 1 - the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black. Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black (given that the attacker is white) is the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black is 0.20 (given in the information), and the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white is 0.20 (computed above).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given this observation. To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the information), P(A) = 0.15 (from the information), and P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 (the expected probability of the witness identifying a random person as black, since 85% of the population is white).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.195 â‰ˆ 0.61

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.61.
