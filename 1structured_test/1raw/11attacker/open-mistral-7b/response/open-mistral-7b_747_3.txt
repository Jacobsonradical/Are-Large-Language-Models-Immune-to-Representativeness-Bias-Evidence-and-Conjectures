To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (the probability of an event before considering new evidence) with new evidence (the probability of the evidence given the event).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given by the city's demographics)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black)

P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker not being black, given by the city's demographics)

We can now compute the probability of the event E (the witness identifying the attacker as black) given the hypothesis H (the attacker is black):

P(E|H) = 0.8

And the probability of the event E given the hypothesis ~H (the attacker is not black):

P(E|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black (H) given the evidence (E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
