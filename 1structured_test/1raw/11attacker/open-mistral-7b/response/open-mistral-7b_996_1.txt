The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness misidentified the race in 20% of their cases, we can consider this as a form of error.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying the race.

Let's denote the probability of the first scenario as P(black) and the probability of the second scenario as P(white).

We know that the probability of making an error (P(white)) is 20%. This means that the probability of not making an error (P(black)) is 1 - P(white) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time. So, the number of times this happened is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is 0.17. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is P(black) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
