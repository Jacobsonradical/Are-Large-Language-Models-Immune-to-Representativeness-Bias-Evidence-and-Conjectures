Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the demographic distribution of the city.

1. Let's assume that the witness's judgement is independent of the actual race of the attacker. This means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is the same as the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

2. We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability of a black person as the actual attacker as P(B). Then, we know that:
   - P(Witness identifies attacker as black | Attacker is black) = P(B) = 0.8 * P(Witness correctly identifies black) + 0.2 * P(Witness incorrectly identifies white)

3. We also know that the probability of a white person as the attacker is 1 - P(B) = 0.15. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2.

4. Therefore, we have another equation:
   - P(Witness identifies attacker as black | Attacker is white) = 0.2

5. Since the witness's judgement is independent, we can set these two probabilities equal to each other:
   - 0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * (1 - P(B)) = 0.2

6. Solving for P(B), we get:
   - 0.8 * P(B) = 0.04
   - P(B) = 0.05

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.05 or 5%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes complete independence of the witness's judgement, which may not be the case in reality.
