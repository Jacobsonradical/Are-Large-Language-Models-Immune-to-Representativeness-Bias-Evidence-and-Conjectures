To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, when the witness incorrectly identifies the race, they are more likely to mistake a black person as white due to the city's racial demographics.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a randomly chosen person being white is 0.85. The witness's error rate of 20% means that they will mistakenly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

To find the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(black|witness error) = (P(witness error|black) * P(black)) / P(witness error)

P(witness error|black) is the probability that the witness mistakes a black person for white, which is the error rate we have, 0.20.
P(black) is the probability of a randomly chosen person being black, which is 0.15 (from the given data).
P(witness error) is the total error rate, which is 0.20.

So, P(black|witness error) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.2 = 0.03

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 3% of the time, we can infer that they correctly identify a black person as black 97% of the time (100% - 3%).

However, we cannot use this information directly to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as we don't know whether the witness had a chance to correctly identify the attacker's race or not. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can only consider the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(black|witness identification) = P(witness identification|black) * P(black) / P(witness identification)

P(witness identification|black) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.80 (from the data).
P(black) is the probability of a randomly chosen person being black, which is 0.15 (from the given data).
P(witness identification) is the total probability of the witness correctly identifying any person's race, which is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a white person (0.85) and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white (0.03).

So, P(black|witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.85 + 0.03) = 0.115

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 11.5%. This is a significantly lower probability than the 80% suggested by the witness, indicating that the witness may have been biased or mistaken in their identification.
