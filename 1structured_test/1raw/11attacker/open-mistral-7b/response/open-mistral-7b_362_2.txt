To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker and made an honest attempt to identify their race. In this scenario, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time, and a black person as white 20% of the time (since the witness is not perfect).

However, the statement "A witness identified the attacker as black" means that the witness did not make that 20% error. Therefore, the probability that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as black is 80%, the probability of correct identification for this witness.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making this error in this particular case is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

The remaining probability is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black. This is 100% - the probability of an error, which is 100% - the probability of an error involving a white person, or 100% - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation, is 0.83. This estimate assumes that the witness saw the attacker and made an honest attempt to identify their race. If the witness may have misidentified the attacker due to poor lighting or other factors, the estimate would be less reliable.
