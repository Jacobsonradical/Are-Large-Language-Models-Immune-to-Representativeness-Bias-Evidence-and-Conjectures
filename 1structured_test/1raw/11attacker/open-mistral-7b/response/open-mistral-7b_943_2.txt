To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

The witness's statement should be considered as a piece of evidence, but not as absolute proof. To incorporate the witness's statement into our probability estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black,
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black (given that the attacker is not black),
- P(B|W) as the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement,
- P(~B|W) as the probability of the attacker not being black given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities:

P(W|B) = 0.8
P(W|~B) = 0.2
P(B) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
P(~B) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.1785

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 17.85%.
