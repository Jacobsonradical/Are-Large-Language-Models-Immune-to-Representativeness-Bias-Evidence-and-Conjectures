Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black. From the information given, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.

Next, let's calculate P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate P(H) as 0.15 (15%).

Now, let's calculate P(E), the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is black, given any attacker. Since we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can calculate P(E) as 0.8 (80%) + 0.2 (20%) * 0.85 (probability of a white person being mistaken for black) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement, using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.1341

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.41%.
