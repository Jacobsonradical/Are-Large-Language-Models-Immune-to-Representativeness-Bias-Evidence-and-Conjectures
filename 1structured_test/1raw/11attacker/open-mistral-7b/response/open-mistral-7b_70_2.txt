Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This is the initial probability that an arbitrary person in the city is black.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is indeed black, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify them as such. Conversely, if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as black.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's reliability to the initial probability, as we don't know the likelihood of the witness encountering a black person versus a white person. So, let's assume for simplicity that the witness encounters an equal number of black and white people.

If the witness encounters a black person, there is a 80% chance they will correctly identify it as such. If they encounter a white person, there is a 20% chance they will incorrectly identify it as black.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the witness will encounter more white people than black people. However, since the witness is not perfect, they will sometimes mistake a white person for a black person.

The key here is that the witness's incorrect identification of a white person as black does not change the fact that the attacker is actually white. Only their correct identification of a black person as black increases the probability that the attacker is black.

So, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

a) The attacker is truly black. In this case, the probability is 1, as the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

b) The witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. In this case, the probability is 0, as the attacker is not black.

Since we don't know the likelihood of these two scenarios, we cannot calculate a precise probability. However, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's reliability.

If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between their correct and incorrect identifications, then the probability that a mistaken identification is made is 20% (the error rate).

This means that in 80% of the cases where the witness identifies a person as black, they are actually correct. The other 20% of the time, they are mistaken.

However, since we don't know the total number of people the witness encounters or the number of times they identify a black person, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Therefore, while we can say that there is a higher probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, we cannot provide a precise probability without more information.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, but the probability is likely higher than 85% (the initial population probability)}
