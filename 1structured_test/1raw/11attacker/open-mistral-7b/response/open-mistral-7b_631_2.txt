Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is stated as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, the witness's error rate applies to a 50-50 white-black population, which is not the case in the city. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). The witness's observation, given the true probability, can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with success probability P(Black). Since the witness's error rate is 20% in a 50-50 population, we can assume that the error rate in this population is also 20%. This means that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, or P(Black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(Black)) * 0.2 = 0.8.

Solving for P(Black), we get P(Black) = 0.5. However, this result assumes that the witness's error rate is the same in the city's population as in a 50-50 population. If we assume that the error rate is higher in the city's population, then the true probability that the attacker is black would be lower.

Therefore, based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate between 0 and 0.5, but a strict numerical answer cannot be given without more information.
