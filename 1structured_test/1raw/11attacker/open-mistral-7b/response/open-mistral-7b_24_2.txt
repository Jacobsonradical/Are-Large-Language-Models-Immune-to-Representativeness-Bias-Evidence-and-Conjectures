To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. Since we cannot be certain whether the witness's mistake in this case was an error of identification or not, we should consider both possibilities:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race and the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error and misidentified the attacker as black.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, times the probability of the witness's identification being correct:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) * P(Witness is correct)

The probability of the second scenario is the probability of the attacker not being black, times the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect:

P(Attacker is not black) * P(Witness is incorrect)

The probabilities P(Attacker is black) and P(Attacker is not black) are the same, given the racial composition of the city's population:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.15
P(Attacker is not black) = 0.85

The probabilities P(Witness is correct) and P(Witness is incorrect) are given by the witness's reliability:

P(Witness is correct) = 0.8
P(Witness is incorrect) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probabilities of the two scenarios and find the overall probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) * P(Witness is correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(Attacker is not black) * P(Witness is incorrect) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The overall probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.29}

The estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.29 (29%). However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and the actual probability could be different.
