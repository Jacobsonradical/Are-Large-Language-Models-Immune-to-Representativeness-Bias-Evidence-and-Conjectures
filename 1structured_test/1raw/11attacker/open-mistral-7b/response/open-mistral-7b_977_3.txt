Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the witness could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the population statistics.

The witness's statement about the attacker's race should be considered as an independent piece of information. If we assume that the witness's statement is true (regardless of the actual race of the attacker), then the probability of the attacker being black is 100%.

If we want to estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the population statistics and assuming that the witness's statement is an error, then the probability would be 15% (since 15% of the population is black).

However, without more information, it is not possible to calculate an exact probability that takes into account both the witness's statement and the population statistics. Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, the probability would be somewhere between 0 and 100% depending on whether the witness's statement is considered reliable or not.}
