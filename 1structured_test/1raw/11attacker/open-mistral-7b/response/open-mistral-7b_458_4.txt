Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race and the city's population demographics, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48, or 48%.
