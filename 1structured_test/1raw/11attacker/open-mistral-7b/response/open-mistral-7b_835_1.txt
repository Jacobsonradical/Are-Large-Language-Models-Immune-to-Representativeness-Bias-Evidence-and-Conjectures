To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can consider the witness's identification as an error. Therefore, the probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black is 20%.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is actually black. The probability of this happening is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness's identification was correct or not, we should consider both possibilities and their probabilities. We can calculate the total probability by adding the probabilities of both events:

{probability: 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black given the city's demographics) + 0.20 (probability of the witness's identification being an error), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The total probability is 0.35. Therefore, our estimate is that there is a 35% chance that the attacker is black.
