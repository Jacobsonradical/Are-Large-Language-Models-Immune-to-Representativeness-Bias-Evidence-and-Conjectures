Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) divided by the probability of the evidence (P(E)).

1. P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 15% in the information. So P(H) = 0.15.
2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80% in the information. So P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness is mistaken 20% of the time, and given that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate this as (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.85 = 0.0293. So P(E|~H) = 0.0293.
4. P(H|E) is the probability we are interested in. It can be found by applying Bayes' theorem: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.0293 * 0.85) = 0.195

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 19.5%. This is a significant decrease from the prior probability of 15%, indicating that the witness's identification is not strong evidence that the attacker is black. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified analysis and does not take into account other factors that might influence the witness's identification, such as lighting conditions or the time elapsed since the attack.
