To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a black person as white or a white person as black, let's assume that the error rate is evenly distributed.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15 (15%). The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time when they were wrong. This means that in these incorrect cases, the witness is mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Since the error rate is evenly distributed, the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a black person as white is also 20%. Therefore, the proportion of times the witness errs in identifying black people is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).

Now, we need to account for the fact that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. This means that the attacker is actually black 80% of the time when the witness correctly identifies race. So, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness correctly identified race is 0.80.

However, we also need to consider the cases where the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black. In these cases, the attacker is actually white. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.20.

To find the overall probability of the attacker being black, we need to add the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness correctly identified race (0.80) to the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness made an error (0.20).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is: 0.80 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.80 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97 (97%)

However, since the error rate is evenly distributed, it is fair to assume that the witness's error rate of 20% applies to both types of errors (mistakenly identifying a black person as white and mistakenly identifying a white person as black). Therefore, the actual error rate is 0.20, not 0.03 as we initially assumed.

Correcting this error, we find that the probability of the witness making an error in identifying black people is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).

The probability of the attacker being black given that the witness correctly identified race is 0.80.

The probability of the attacker being white given that the witness made an error is 0.15 * 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.017 (1.7%).

Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being black is: 0.80 + 0.017 = 0.817 (81.7%)
