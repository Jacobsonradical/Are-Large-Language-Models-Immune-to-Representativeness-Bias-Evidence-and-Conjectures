Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' Theorem is a probability theory that describes the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

In this case, we want to find P(Attacker is black | Witness statement), given P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) and P(Witness statement | Attacker is not black).

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) = 0.8 and P(Witness statement | Attacker is not black) = 0.2.

From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, P(Attacker is black) = 0.15 and P(Attacker is not black) = 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find P(Attacker is black | Witness statement):

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = [P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness statement | Attacker is not black) * P(Attacker is not black)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the result, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
