To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial distribution of the population.

The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume this error rate is independent of the attacker's race, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) times the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness describing the attacker as black.

We have the following information:
- P(A|B) is what we want to find: the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness described the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness describes the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black. This is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) (the probability of the witness being correct) and P(B|not A) * P(not A) (the probability of the witness being incorrect). Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) is 0.2, and P(not A) is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white), so P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.255.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.255
         = 0.316

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.316, or 31.6%.
