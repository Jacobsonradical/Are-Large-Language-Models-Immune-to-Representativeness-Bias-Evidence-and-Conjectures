Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness's statement suggests that given a person, there is a 0.8 probability that they will correctly identify the person's race as black if the person is indeed black, and a 0.2 probability of incorrectly identifying the person as black when they are actually black.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the witness would make the statement "I saw a black person" if the attacker was actually white. This can be calculated as the product of the probability of the witness making an error (0.2) and the probability of the attacker being white (0.85).

So, P(witness says "black" | attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we know that the witness made the statement "I saw a black person". This means that either the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, or the attacker is white and the witness made an error.

The probability of the first event (correct identification) is P(witness says "black" | attacker is black) = 0.8

Since the two events are mutually exclusive, their probabilities add up to the total probability of the witness making the statement "I saw a black person". We can write this as:

P(witness says "black") = P(witness says "black" | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says "black" | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

Substituting the known values:

0.8 = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.17 * 0.85

Solving for P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is black) â‰ˆ 0.67

So, our estimate is that there is a 67% probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: 0.67}
