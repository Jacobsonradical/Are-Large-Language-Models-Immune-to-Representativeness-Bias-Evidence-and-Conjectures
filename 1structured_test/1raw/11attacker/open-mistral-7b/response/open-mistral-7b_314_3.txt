To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.
2. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness mistakenly identified a white person as black 20% of the time. Since there is a higher percentage of white people in the city (85%), we can assume that a significant portion of the mistakes made by the witness were due to misidentifying white people as black.

However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this suggests that there is a higher likelihood that the attacker is actually black.

We can't ignore the racial composition of the city either. Even though the witness may have mistakenly identified some white people as black, the majority of the population in the city is still white. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being black is higher than the city's racial composition of 15%.

Given the information provided, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is around 0.58 (58%). This is a rough estimate and assumes that the witness's error rate is consistent across all racial groups, which may not be the case. It's also important to note that this is not a definitive answer and that further investigation would be needed to reach a more accurate conclusion.
