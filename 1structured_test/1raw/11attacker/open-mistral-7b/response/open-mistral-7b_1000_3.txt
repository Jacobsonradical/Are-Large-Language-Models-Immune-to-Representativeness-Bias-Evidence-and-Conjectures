To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these statistics, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be computed as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies this is 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12

2. The probability that the attacker is not black (white) and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black is 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

3. Therefore, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race and relies solely on the witness's identification, we should consider the witness's identification as evidence and adjust our probability estimate accordingly. To do this, we can divide the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification by the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41}

This estimate suggests that, given the witness's identification and considering the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, there is a 41% probability that the attacker is black. It's important to note that this is a conditional probability and does not necessarily reflect the true probability of the attacker's race, as the witness's identification might be an unreliable source of information.
