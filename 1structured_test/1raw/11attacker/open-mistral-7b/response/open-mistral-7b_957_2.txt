Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not perfect in judging race, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, with an equal number of white and black people in the sample.

Given this, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black. Let's denote the probability as P(black).

The witness's incorrect identification of the attacker as black would occur in two cases: when the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black, or when the attacker is black but the witness mistakenly identifies another person (who is white) as the attacker.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. When the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black: P(white) * P(witness mistakes white for black) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
2. When the attacker is black but the witness mistakenly identifies another person as the attacker: P(black) * P(witness mistakes black for white) = P(black) * 0.2

Since the two events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black and witness is correct) + P(attacker is black and witness is incorrect)

P(attacker is black) = P(black) * 0.8 + P(black) * 0.2

We can simplify and solve for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(black)) / 1
P(black) = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(black)
P(black) = 0.2 * P(black) + P(black)
0.8 * P(black) = P(black)
P(black) = 0.8 * P(black) / 0.8

P(black) = 1

However, since the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1, the witness's description of the attacker being black is not consistent with the population statistics. This suggests that there might be additional information or errors in the information provided.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker is black cannot be accurately estimated and seems to be inconsistent with the given population statistics. Please review the information provided or consult additional sources.
