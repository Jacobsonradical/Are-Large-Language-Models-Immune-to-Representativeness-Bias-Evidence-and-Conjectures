To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial distribution of the population. The witness incorrectly identifies as black 20% of the time when the person is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the attacker is either black or white, the probability of the attacker being black is the complementary probability to the probability of the attacker being white. The probability of the attacker being white is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person plus the probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

So, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 + 0.17 = 0.62 or 62%.

The probability of the attacker being black is 1 - 0.62 = 0.38 or 38%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.38}.
