Given the information provided, the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not 100% reliable in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the city's demographics and the witness's reliability. Since the witness made a mistake, there's a chance that they misidentified the attacker's race.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black and the probability of making an error when the attacker is black.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person.

Since 15% of the population is black and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person.

Since 15% of the population is black and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white and the probability of making an error when the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white is the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person.

Since 85% of the population is white and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 or 68%.

The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person.

Since 85% of the population is white and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, we can calculate the total probability of the witness making a correct identification and the probability of the witness making an error.

The total probability of the witness making a correct identification is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black plus the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white.

Total probability of correct identification = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8 or 80%.

The probability of the witness making an error is the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black plus the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white.

Probability of error = 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.2 or 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's identification.

To do this, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given the occurrence of event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(black|witness)) = P(witness|black) * P(black) / P(witness)

where:
- P(witness|black) is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black (0.12),
- P(black) is the probability of the attacker being black (0.15),
- P(witness) is the total probability of the witness making a correct identification (0.8).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black (0.12) is already calculated from the information given. The probability of the attacker being black (0.15) is given in the information.

To calculate the total probability of the witness making a correct identification (0.8), we can use the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event A is equal to the sum of the probabilities of A given each of the mutually exclusive events B1, B2, ..., Bn that make up the sample space.

P(witness) = P(witness|black) * P(black) + P(witness|white) * P(white)

where:
- P(witness|black) is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black (0.12),
- P(black) is the probability of the attacker being black (0.15),
- P(witness|white) is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white (0.68),
- P(white) is the probability of the attacker being white (0.85).

P(witness|white) is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white (0.68) and can be calculated from the information given.

Now we can calculate P(witness):

P(witness) = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.68 * 0.85 = 0.186 + 0.578 = 0.764

Now we can calculate P(black|witness):

P(black|witness) = (0.12 * 0.15) / 0.764 â‰ˆ 0.021 or 2.1%

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually black is approximately 2.1%. This is significantly lower than the city's population of 15% black people, indicating that the witness's identification may be unreliable.
