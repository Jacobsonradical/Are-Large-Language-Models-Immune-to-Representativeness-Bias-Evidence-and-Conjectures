Given the information provided, the overall population distribution is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is only 80% accurate, meaning they incorrectly identify race 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that they made an error in their observation.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's erroneous identification, is the error rate of 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that they are white, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

In summary, {probability: 0.80} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black, considering both the city demographics and the witness's reliability.
