To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

1. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. Population distribution: The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is either white or black. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is the error rate for white people (since the witness errs 20% of the time). Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is the error rate for black people (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, we can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. P(black) * 0.8 (correct identification by witness) + 0.15 * P(black) * 0.2 (false identification by witness) = 0.1 (actual probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement)
2. P(white) * 0.2 (error by witness) + 0.85 * P(white) * 1 = 0.9 (actual probability of the attacker being white given the witness's statement)

We can solve these equations to find the probabilities:

1. P(black) = (0.1 - 0.15 * 0.2 * P(black)) / 0.8 = 0.1 / 0.95 = 0.1053 (rounded to 6 decimal places)
2. P(white) = 0.9

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.1053 or 10.53%. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on the given information and assumptions.
