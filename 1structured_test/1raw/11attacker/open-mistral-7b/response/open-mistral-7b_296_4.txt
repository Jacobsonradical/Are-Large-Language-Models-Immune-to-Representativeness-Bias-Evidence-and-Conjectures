Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the attack happened at night and the witness could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this specific case.

To make an estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness says the attacker is black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy rate, 0.8)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city, 0.15)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the sum of the probability of the evidence given each hypothesis, 0.15 * P(E|H) + 0.85 * P(E|~H))

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|~H), the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is not black. Without this, we cannot calculate the probability of the evidence, P(E). Therefore, we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem to make a precise estimate.

However, we can still make an approximate estimate by assuming that the witness's accuracy rate, 0.8, applies to both white and black people. This means that if the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. This would mean that if the attacker is white, the witness would say the attacker is black about 17% of the time (0.2 * 0.85), and if the attacker is black, the witness would say the attacker is black about 96% of the time (0.8 * 0.15).

The probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is therefore approximately 0.96, and the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is approximately 0.17.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, would then be the ratio of these probabilities: 0.96 / (0.96 + 0.17) = 0.85.

This is an approximate estimation, and the actual probability might be different, as we have made assumptions that were not supported by the provided information. Therefore, the estimate should be interpreted with caution.

{probability: 0.85, please note that this is an approximate estimate}
