Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Given that the population composition is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black by considering both the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

The probability of a false positive (witness misidentifying a white person as black) is the error rate times the proportion of white people in the city:

0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The probability of a true positive (witness correctly identifying a black person as black) is the accuracy rate times the proportion of black people in the city:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, since the witness reported seeing a black person, the event we're interested in is a true positive. Therefore, the probability we're looking for is the probability of a true positive, which is 0.12.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is 0.12. This means that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, based on this specific witness's testimony and the city's demographics. It's important to note that this is just one estimate and actual probabilities could be different in real-world scenarios.
