Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the demographic distribution of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

From the demographic information, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, P(black) = 0.15.

However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is not the same as the true proportion of black people in the city. The witness is wrong 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify a white person as black. Therefore, when the witness identifies a person as black, we cannot be 100% certain that they are correct.

Let's say the witness identifies the attacker as black. The probability that this identification is correct is the witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 0.8. So, P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = 0.8.

Now, let's consider the opposite scenario, where the witness identifies the attacker as white. The probability that this identification is incorrect is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2. So, P(attacker is black | witness identifies as white) = 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should use the probability P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = 0.8.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is {probability: 0.8}. This estimate takes into account both the demographic distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.
