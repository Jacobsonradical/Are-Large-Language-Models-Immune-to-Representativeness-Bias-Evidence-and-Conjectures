Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the related conditions are the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

Bayes' theorem can be represented as:

P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A | B) is the probability of the event A given evidence B
- P(B | A) is the probability of observing evidence B given that the event A is true
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A
- P(B) is the probability of observing evidence B

First, let's define our variables:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B | A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black in this case)
- P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)) (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A | B):

P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / P(B)
        = [1 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
        = 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.04)
        = 0.15 / 0.16
        = 0.9375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.9375 or 93.75%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on the assumptions and information provided and may not accurately reflect the true situation.
