Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

1. The racial demographics of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as black. We can't assume that the witness's error was due to misidentifying a white person as black, as we don't have enough information to make that assumption.

Instead, let's assume that the witness's error was equally likely to be due to misidentifying a black person as white as it was to misidentify a white person as black. In this case, the witness's error would reduce the overall probability that the attacker is black by 20%, as the witness's statement provides no additional evidence to support the attacker being black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64%}

This estimate assumes that the witness's error was equally likely to be due to misidentifying a black person as white as it was to misidentify a white person as black. If we had more information to suggest otherwise, the estimate could change.
