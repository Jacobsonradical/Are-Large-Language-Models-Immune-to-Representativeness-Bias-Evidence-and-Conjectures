Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be:

{probability: 0.88}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately judge race is only 80% accurate. This means they make an error 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than 80%.
4. The error rate of the witness provides a lower bound for the true probability of the attacker being black.
5. Therefore, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is higher than 80%, but we cannot give an exact number without more information.
6. A reasonable estimate could be around 0.88, which is 88%. This assumes that the true probability is as high as the witness's error rate allows, given their 80% accuracy.
