Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the likelihood of the witness making an error when identifying the race of the attacker as follows:

1. The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (given in the information).
2. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is the error rate, which is 0.20.
3. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is the accuracy rate, which is 0.80.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, as the error rate applies only to white people in this case.

Since the witness reported seeing a black person, the minimum probability that the attacker is black is 100% (as the witness's report suggests). But considering the witness's error rate, there's a non-zero chance that the witness made an error.

Therefore, without more information, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate. A conservative estimate, considering the witness's error rate, would be lower than 100%. However, without more specific data, a definitive probability cannot be calculated.
