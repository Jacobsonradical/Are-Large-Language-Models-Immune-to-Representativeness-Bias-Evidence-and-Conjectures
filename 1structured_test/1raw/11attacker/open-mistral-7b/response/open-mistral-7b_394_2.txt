Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identifies the race. The probability of this scenario is 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black).
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identifies the race. The probability of this scenario is 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.20 (probability of the witness making a mistake).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the first scenario divided by the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

(0.15) / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.465

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.465 or 46.5%.
