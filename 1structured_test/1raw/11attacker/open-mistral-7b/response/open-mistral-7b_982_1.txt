Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, H is the attacker is black, E is the witness's identification, P(H|E) is the probability we are trying to find, P(E|H) is the witness's 80% accuracy rate, P(H) is the city's black population proportion (15%), and P(E) is the probability of the witness making that identification (which we can calculate using the witness's 20% error rate).

First, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = 1 - P(not E) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / 0.80 = 0.12

So, the probability estimate that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case in reality. The actual probability may be different.
