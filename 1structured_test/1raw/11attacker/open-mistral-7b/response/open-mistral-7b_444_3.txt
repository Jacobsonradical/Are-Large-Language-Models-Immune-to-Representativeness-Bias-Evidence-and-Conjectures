Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information since the witness's identification might have been an error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the population composition. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is the error rate: 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, or 17%.

Since we cannot rule out that the witness's identification was correct, we also need to consider the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified him/her. This is the product of the error rate for correctly identifying a black person (100% - 80% = 20%) and the probability that the attacker is black (0.15). So, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified him/her is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03, or 3%.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20, or 20%.
