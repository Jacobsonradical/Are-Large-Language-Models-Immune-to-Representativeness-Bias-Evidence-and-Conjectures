Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that they are black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
3. P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that they are not black. Since the population is 85% white, and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(B|~A) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
4. P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's race as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.242

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.242 â‰ˆ 0.331

Thus, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 33.1%.
