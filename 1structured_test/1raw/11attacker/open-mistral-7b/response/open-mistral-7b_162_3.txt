Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the racial distribution in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

We are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is not black)

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, P(E|~H) = 0.2, and P(~H) = 0.85 (since P(H) + P(~H) = 1).

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.16
          = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge race is the same in all conditions, which may not be the case. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on factors such as lighting, distance, and the witness's familiarity with different racial groups.
