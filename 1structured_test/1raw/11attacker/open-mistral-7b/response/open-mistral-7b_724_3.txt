Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's calculate each term:
1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering the witness's testimony. This is given by the population distribution, so P(H) = 0.15 (15%).
3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the probability that the witness would identify someone as black, regardless of their actual race. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8 * 0.5 (the probability of a random person being black) = 0.04.
4. P(H|E) is the probability we're trying to find, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.04
     = 0.625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.625 or 62.5%.
