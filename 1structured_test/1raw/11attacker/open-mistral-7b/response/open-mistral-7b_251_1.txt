To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the likelihood of an event based on prior knowledge. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the prior knowledge is the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identifies attacker as black

We are given:
- P(A) = Probability of attacker being black in the population (from information b)
- P(B|A) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person (given by the witness's ability)
- P(B|~A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, this is (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.17)
- P(~A) = Probability of attacker being white in the population (1 - P(A))

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly (P(B|A)) and the probability of the witness identifying a white person incorrectly (P(B|~A)) and sum them up: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities and estimate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(B|~A) = 0.17
P(~A) = 0.85

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.124 + 0.1465 = 0.2705

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2705 â‰ˆ 0.331

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.331, or 33.1%.
