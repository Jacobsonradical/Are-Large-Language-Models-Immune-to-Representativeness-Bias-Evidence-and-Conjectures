To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A: The attacker is black.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time.)
- P(A) = Unknown (The prior probability of the attacker being black.)
- P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)) (The probability of the witness making the identification, given the actual race of the attacker.)

Since we do not have the prior probability P(A), we cannot calculate the exact probability directly. However, we can use the given city demographics to make an informed estimate.

P(A) = Proportion of black people in the city = 0.15

Using this information, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
         = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.177
         = 0.297

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.297
         â‰ˆ 0.334

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.334 or 33.4%.
