Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event A given another event B, and is often written as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker is black. This is given as 15% in the information provided.

Next, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80% in the information provided.

Then, we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies any person as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct (when the person is black) and the probabilities of the witness making an error (when the person is white).

The probability of the witness making an error is given as 20% in the information provided. The probability of the witness being correct when the person is white is 1 - P(B|A) when the person is white, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
