To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

1. P(A): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't have any initial information, we can assume that the prior probability is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

2. P(B|A): This is the likelihood of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of a correct identification given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

3. P(B): This is the probability of the witness making the statement, regardless of the attacker's race. Since 15% of the population is black, and the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making a statement that a black person is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18.

4. P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.78

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 78%.
