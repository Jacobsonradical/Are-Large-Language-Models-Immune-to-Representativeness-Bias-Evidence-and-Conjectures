Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify races.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's accuracy in identifying races is not perfect, with a 20% error rate. The witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's identification could be calculated as the probability of the witness being correct in this particular case, which is equal to the witness's true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity.

We know that the TPR is 0.8 (80%), and we don't have any information that would suggest this particular identification is more or less likely to be correct than any other. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.

In summary, {probability: 0.8} is our estimate.
