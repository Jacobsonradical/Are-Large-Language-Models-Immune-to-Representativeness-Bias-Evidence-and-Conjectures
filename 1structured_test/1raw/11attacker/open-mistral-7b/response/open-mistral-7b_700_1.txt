The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event A (the attacker is black) given evidence B (the witness's identification) to the prior probability of A and the likelihood of B given A.

In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (given in information "a"). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (given in information "b").

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time). The prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (given in information "a").

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.15 * (0.8 / (0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15)) = 0.26}

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.26.
