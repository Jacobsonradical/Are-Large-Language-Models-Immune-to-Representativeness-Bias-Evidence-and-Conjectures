Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's break this down:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Evidence B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is given as 15% in the city population. The probability of B given A (P(B|A)) is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person, which is 80%. The probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)) is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

To find P(not A), we subtract P(A) from 1: P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, based on the information given, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
