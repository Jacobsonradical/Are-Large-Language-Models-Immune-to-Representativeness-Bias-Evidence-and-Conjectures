To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this means there is a 20% chance that the attacker is not black. However, we know that the actual attacker's race is either black or white, so the probability that the attacker is white must be equal to the probability that the attacker is black times the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white. Then, we can write the equation:

P(white) = P(black) * 0.2

We also know that the total probability of the attacker being either black or white is 1, so we can write another equation:

P(black) + P(white) = 1

Substituting P(white) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

P(black) + P(black) * 0.2 = 1

Solving for P(black), we find:

P(black) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
