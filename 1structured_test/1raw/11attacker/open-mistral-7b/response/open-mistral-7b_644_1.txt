To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of the attacker being black
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (given that the attacker is black)
P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (given that the attacker is not black)
P(~A) = Probability of the attacker being not black

We are also given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the sample is half white and half black, we can assume that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|~A) = 0.2.

We are also given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.272

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that there is a 27.2% probability that the attacker is black.
