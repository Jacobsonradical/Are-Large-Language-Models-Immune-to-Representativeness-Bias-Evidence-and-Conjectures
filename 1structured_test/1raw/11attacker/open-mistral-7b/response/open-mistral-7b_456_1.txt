Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (correct identification) and 20% (erroneous identification).
2. The demographic distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, there is no information about how likely the witness was to mistake a white person for a black person compared to mistaking a black person for a white person. Without this information, we cannot accurately calculate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's statement.

Therefore, I must conclude that I cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, as there are missing data points in the information provided.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
