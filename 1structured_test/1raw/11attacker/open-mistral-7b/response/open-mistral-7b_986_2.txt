The information provided includes two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the accuracy of the witness in racial identification.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness identifying the attacker as black

P(E|H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was actually black)
P(H) is given as 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black, which we are trying to find)
P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, regardless of their actual race. To find this, we can calculate P(E) as the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H denotes the attacker being white.

P(E|~H) is given as 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was actually white)
P(~H) is given as 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white)

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.275

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
