Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about whether the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct or not. Therefore, we cannot directly use these percentages to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

The second piece of information (b) tells us that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Without knowing whether the witness's identification aligns with the actual race of the attacker, we cannot use this information to estimate the probability either.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it's not possible to provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
