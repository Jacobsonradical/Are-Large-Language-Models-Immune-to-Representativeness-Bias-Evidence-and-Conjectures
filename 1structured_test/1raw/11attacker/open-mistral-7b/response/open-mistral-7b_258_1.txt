To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify someone as black, given that the person is actually black. Given the information in part "a", this is 0.8 (80%).

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given the information in part "b", this is 0.15 (15%).

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is the sum of the probabilities of the witness making this statement if the attacker is black and if the attacker is white. Given the information in part "a", this is 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person) * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) + 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person) * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
