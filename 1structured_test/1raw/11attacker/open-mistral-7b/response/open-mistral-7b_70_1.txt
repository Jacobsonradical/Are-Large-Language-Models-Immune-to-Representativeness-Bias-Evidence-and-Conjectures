Based on the information given, the probability of the attacker being black is not 80%, as suggested by the witness's ability to correctly identify race. Instead, we should consider the reliability of the witness's identification in this specific case.

Since the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% in ideal conditions, and in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker's race, the probability that the attacker is actually white is higher.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as p, and the probability of the attacker being white as 1 - p. According to the witness's ability, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.

However, since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the attacker must be white with a higher probability. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white is higher than 0.8 (1 - 0.2), and the probability of the attacker being black is lower than 0.2.

Unfortunately, without more information about the specific error rate of the witness when identifying the attacker's race, it is impossible to provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. Nonetheless, the witness's statement that the attacker is black does not necessarily imply that the attacker is actually black.
