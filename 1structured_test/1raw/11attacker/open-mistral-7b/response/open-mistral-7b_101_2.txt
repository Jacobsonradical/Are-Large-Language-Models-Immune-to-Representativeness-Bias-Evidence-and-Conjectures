To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black.

Let's assume that the true probability of the attacker being black is P(Black). The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as such is 0.8 (80%). So, P(Witness correctly identifies Black | Black) = 0.8.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.15 (15% of the population is black) times the probability that the witness errs in identifying a white person as black (0.2, or 20% of the time). So, P(Witness incorrectly identifies Black | Not Black) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability P(Black) given the witness's identification:

P(Black | Witness identifies Black) = P(Witness identifies Black | Black) * P(Black) / [P(Witness identifies Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness incorrectly identifies Black | Not Black) * P(Not Black)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(Black | Witness identifies Black) = 0.8 * P(Black) / [0.8 * P(Black) + 0.03 * (1 - P(Black))]

To solve for P(Black), we can rearrange this equation to make P(Black) the subject:

P(Black) = [0.8 * P(Black | Witness identifies Black)] / [0.8 * P(Black | Witness identifies Black) + 0.03 * (1 - P(Black))]

Since we don't have a direct way to estimate P(Black | Witness identifies Black), we can't provide a numerical value for P(Black). However, we can express P(Black) as a function of P(Black | Witness identifies Black):

{probability: [0.8 * P(Black | Witness identifies Black)] / [0.8 * P(Black | Witness identifies Black) + 0.03 * (1 - P(Black))], please provide a function}
