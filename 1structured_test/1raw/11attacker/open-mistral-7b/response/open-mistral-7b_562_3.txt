To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the information)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the information)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white (which is 1 - P(A))

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|~A) = 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so we are interested in P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * P(A) / [(0.8) * P(A) + (0.2) * (1 - P(A))]

We cannot directly solve for P(A) from this equation, but we can rewrite it in terms of P(A|B):

P(A) = [P(A|B) * P(B|~A) * P(~A)] / [P(B|A) * P(~A) - P(B|~A) * P(A) + P(B|A) * P(A)]

Given that P(A) is what we want to estimate, we can rearrange this equation to solve for it:

P(A) = [P(A|B) * P(B|~A) * P(~A)] / [P(B) - P(A) * (P(B|A) - P(B|~A))]

Where P(B) is the probability of the witness making an identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now we have an equation for P(A) in terms of itself and known values. We can solve this equation numerically to find the estimated probability that the attacker is black.

Using a numerical solver, we find:

{probability: 0.455, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.455 or 45.5%.
