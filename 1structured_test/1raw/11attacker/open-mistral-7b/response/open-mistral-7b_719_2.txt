To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, and the city is 85% white and 15% black. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (0.15).
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.80.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (P(B|A) * P(A)) and incorrectly identifying a white attacker (P(B|not A) * P(not A)).

Since P(B|not A) is 0.20 (the witness's error rate), and P(not A) is 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white), we have P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.245.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.245 â‰ˆ 0.328

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.328 or 32.8%.
