To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which provides a method to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's define the following variables:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We can calculate the probabilities of these events as follows:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the given information)
P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black (given that the attacker is not black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and there's an 85% chance the attacker is white)
P(~A) = Probability that the attacker is not black = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
