The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is relatively accurate in identifying races (80% correct, 20% incorrect) identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(black) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15)
- P(white) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (0.85)
- P(witness said black | attacker is black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (0.8)
- P(witness said black | attacker is white) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black (0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04)

According to the witness's ability, the probability that the witness said black given the attacker is black is 0.8, and the probability that the witness said black given the attacker is white is 0.04.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness said black) = [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness said black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.04 * 0.85)

Calculating the result, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness said black) = 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.24, or 24%. Note that this estimate takes into account both the population demographics and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.
