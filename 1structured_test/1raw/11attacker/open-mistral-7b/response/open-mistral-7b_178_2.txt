Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (called the likelihood)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we have the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the total probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the attacker's race)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
