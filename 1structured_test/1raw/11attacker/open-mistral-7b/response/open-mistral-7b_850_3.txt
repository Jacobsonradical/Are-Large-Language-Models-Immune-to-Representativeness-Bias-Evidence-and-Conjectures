To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (making an error). Since we don't have information about whether the witness made an error in this specific case, we'll assume that the probability of error and the probability of correct identification are equal. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness making an error (identifying the attacker as white) is also 0.8 (80%).

However, we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. The witness's identification should align with these population proportions to some extent, even if the witness's identification is not perfectly reliable.

We can estimate the probability of the attacker being black by calculating the weighted average of the witness's identification and the city's racial composition.

The weight for the city's racial composition is its proportion in the population, which is 0.15 (15%). The weight for the witness's identification is 1 - the weight for the city's racial composition, which is 0.85 (85%).

The weighted average is then:

0.8 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.64 + 0.0225 = 0.6625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.6625 (66.25%). This estimate takes into account both the witness's unreliability and the racial composition of the city.
