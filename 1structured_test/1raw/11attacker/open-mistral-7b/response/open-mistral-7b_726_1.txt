To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(E|H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, and P(E) is the probability of the witness making the identification.

First, we need to find P(E|H). Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(H). Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of drawing a black person from the population).

Then, we need to find P(E). Since the witness correctly identifies a white person 85% of the time and makes an error 15% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people, P(E) = 0.85 * 0.85 + 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.7325 (the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the attacker's race).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.7325
       â‰ˆ 0.116

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 11.6%. This means that, based on this evidence, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black. However, the witness's identification is not very reliable, so this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
