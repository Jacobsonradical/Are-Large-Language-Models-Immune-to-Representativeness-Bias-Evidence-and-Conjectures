Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (with a 20% error rate).
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness description).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In our case, this is the witness's ability to correctly identify black people, which is 0.8 (or 80%).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. In our case, this is the population composition, which is 0.15 (or 15%).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the overall probability of the witness describing someone as black, considering both white and black people. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Where ~H denotes the complement of the hypothesis (attacker is not black), which is the probability of the attacker being white. Therefore, P(~H) = 0.85 (or 85%).

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, P(E|~H) = 0.8 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 1 = 0.2 (or 20%).

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, based on the witness's description and the population composition, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
