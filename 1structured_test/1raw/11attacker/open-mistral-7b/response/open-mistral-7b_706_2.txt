To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can assume that the witness's error rate applies. So, there's a 20% chance that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, and a 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

However, without knowing the specific number of white and black people in the city that the witness saw, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's observation. Therefore, we cannot provide a strictly numerical answer in the given context.

To get a rough estimate, we can assume that the number of white and black people the witness saw was similar to the racial composition of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be approximately 15%, considering the 80% accuracy of the witness's race identification.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}. However, it's important to note that this is an approximation and the actual probability could be different based on the specific number of white and black people the witness saw.
