To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that provides a way to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering any evidence)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (before considering any evidence)
- P(B|w) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(~B|w) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black

We are given the following information:
1) P(B) = 0.15 (from part b)
2) P(w|B) = 0.8 (from part a)
3) P(w|~B) = 0.2 (from part a)

We can now calculate the posterior probability P(B|w), which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|w) = [P(B) * P(w|B)] / [P(B) * P(w|B) + P(~B) * P(w|~B)]

Plugging in the values:
P(B|w) = [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]
     = 0.12 / 0.178
     = 0.67 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
