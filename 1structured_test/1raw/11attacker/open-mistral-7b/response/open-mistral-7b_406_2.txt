Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about the specific error rate for misidentifying a black person as white. Without this information, we can't directly apply the witness's success rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

However, we do know the racial composition of the city. If 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it would make sense to assume that the witness's errors in identifying race would be more likely to be misidentifying a black person as white, given the prevalence of white people in the city.

Therefore, as a rough estimate, we could potentially adjust the witness's success rate of 80% downward to account for this potential bias. But without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability.

So, while I can't provide a strict numerical answer in the dictionary format you requested, I would suggest that the probability that the attacker is black might be lower than 80%, but without more information, it's impossible to provide a precise number.
