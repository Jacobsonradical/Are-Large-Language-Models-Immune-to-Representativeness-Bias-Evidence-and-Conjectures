To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the demographic distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The demographic distribution of the city's population: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it's likely that the attacker is actually white. However, we should consider the probability of this mistake happening due to the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is P(white) * Error rate = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this is equivalent to the event that the attacker is white and the witness makes an error.

Therefore, P(black) = 1 - P(white) * Error rate = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

{probability: 0.83}
