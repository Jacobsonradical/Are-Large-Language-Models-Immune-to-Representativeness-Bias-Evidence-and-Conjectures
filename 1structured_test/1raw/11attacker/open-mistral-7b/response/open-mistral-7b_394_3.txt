Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the true race of the attacker, then the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black in the population, plus the probability of the witness making an error multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white in the population.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white. We are given P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) + P(W) = 1.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black means that either they made a correct identification (with probability 0.8) or they made an error (with probability 0.2). So, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is P(Witness said "black" | B) = 0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * P(W) = 0.8P(B) + 0.15.

Similarly, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is P(Witness said "black" | W) = 0.2 * P(B) + 0.8 * P(W) = 0.15P(B).

Since the witness's statement is the same in both cases, we have a system of equations:

0.8P(B) + 0.15 = P(Witness said "black")
0.15P(B) = P(Witness said "black") - 0.8P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = P(Witness said "black") / (0.85 + 0.15 * P(Witness said "black") / P(Witness said "black" - 0.8P(B))).

From the given information, P(Witness said "black") = 0.8. Plugging this into the equation, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 / (0.85 + 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.8 - 0.8P(B)))

Solving this equation numerically, we find that P(B) â‰ˆ 0.24, or 24%.

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the population statistics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24%.
