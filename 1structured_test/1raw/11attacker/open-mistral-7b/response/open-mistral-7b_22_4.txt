Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:
1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, but we don't know if they are more likely to incorrectly identify someone as black or white.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
3. If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races (which is not necessarily the case, but it's the best assumption we can make with the given information), then the witness's incorrect identification of a black person as white would account for 20% of their total errors.
4. So, the number of times the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (10% of the time).
5. This means that the witness correctly identified a black person as black 90% of the time (0.9 * 0.5 = 0.45 times out of 5).
6. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the attacker is one of the 0.45 times the witness correctly identified as black.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.45 (or 45%).

Answer: {probability: 0.45}
