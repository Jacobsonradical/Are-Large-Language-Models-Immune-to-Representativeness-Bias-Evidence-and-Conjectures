To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white.

Let P(W) be the probability of the witness being correct, and P(E) be the probability of the witness being incorrect. We know that P(W) + P(E) = 1.

The probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is white is equal to the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2. So, P(E|white) = 0.2.

We also know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is white is then P(W|white) = 1 - P(E|white) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black is P(W|black) = 0.8 (from the given information).

The probability of the attacker being black is then P(black) = P(W|black) / (P(W|black) + P(W|white)), which can be calculated as:

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.8 * 0.15) = 0.8 / 0.84 = 0.9545

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.95, or 95%. This means that, based on the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, there is a 95% chance that the attacker is black.
