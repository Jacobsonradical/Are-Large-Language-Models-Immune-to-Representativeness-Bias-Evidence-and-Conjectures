Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification),
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (probability of witness identifying a person as black, regardless of the person's actual race)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12 * 0.125 = 0.015625 or approximately 1.56%

However, given that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is not perfect and the error rate is 20%, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness may have made an error. In this case, it would be more prudent to consider a range of probabilities rather than a single point estimate.

Assuming the witness's error rate is symmetric (i.e., they are just as likely to identify a black person as white as they are to identify a white person as black when they are wrong), we can estimate the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification as black, and then subtract this from 1 to get an estimate of the probability of the attacker being black.

The probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification as black is:

P(not H|E) = P(E|not H) * P(not H) / P(E) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.12 = 0.170833 or approximately 17.08%

Subtracting this from 1 gives an estimated range of probabilities for the attacker being black:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 1 - P(not H|E) = 1 - 0.170833 = 0.829167 or approximately 82.92%

Therefore, based on the given information and assuming a symmetric error rate for the witness, the attacker is likely to be black, with an estimated probability between 82.92% and 100%. However, due to the limitations of the witness's ability to judge race accurately in the given conditions, this estimate should be viewed as a rough approximation rather than a precise number.
