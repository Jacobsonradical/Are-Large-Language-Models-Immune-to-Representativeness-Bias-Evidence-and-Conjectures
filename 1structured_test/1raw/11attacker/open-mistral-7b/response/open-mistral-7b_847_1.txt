Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

However, we must consider that the witness also made errors, 20% of the time, in identifying race. Since we don't know if the witness's error this time was misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa, we can't simply assume that the 15% black population is the actual attacker.

Therefore, it's not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the given information. It would require more context or information about the witness's error rate in misidentifying black people as white.
