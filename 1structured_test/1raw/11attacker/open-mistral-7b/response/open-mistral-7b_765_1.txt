Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city population is 85% white and 15% black.

Assuming that the witness saw the attacker for long enough to make a reasonable judgment about the attacker's race, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem used in statistics and machine learning to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time and mistakes white people for black 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B|A) as follows:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (correct identification of a black person) + 0.02 * 0.15 (mistaking a white person for black) = 0.8 + 0.003 = 0.803

Next, we need to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black. This is given by the city's population statistics:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population)

Now, we can find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies anyone as black:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black, which is equal to 0.2 (20% error rate). P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is equal to 0.85 (85% white population).

P(B) = 0.803 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12045 + 0.1765 = 0.3

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.803 * 0.15 / 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.2345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.2345 or 23.45%.
