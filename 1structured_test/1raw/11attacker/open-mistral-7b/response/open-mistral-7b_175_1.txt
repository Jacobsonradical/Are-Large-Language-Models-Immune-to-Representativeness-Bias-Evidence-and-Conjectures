Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental principle in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black

The probability of H (P(H)) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. We don't have this information directly, but we can infer it based on the racial composition of the city (from information b):

P(H) = probability of a random person being black = 0.15 (from information b)

The likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)) is the probability that a black person is mistakenly identified as white by the witness. We know this probability is 0.20 (from information a).

The likelihood of E given not-H (P(E|not-H)) is the probability that a white person is mistakenly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, this probability is the same as P(E|H), which is 0.20.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(H|E) = 0.20 * 0.15 / [0.20 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.14

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.14 or 14%. This estimate is lower than the 15% racial composition of the city because the witness was not perfect in identifying races.
