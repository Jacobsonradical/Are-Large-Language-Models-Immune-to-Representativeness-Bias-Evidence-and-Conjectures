Based on the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that the actual attacker was not black.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random attack being committed by a black person is 15%. However, we know that the witness's error rate is higher than the city's demographic proportion of black people.

The witness's error rate of 20% tells us that in 20% of the cases, the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black. Since there are more white people in the city, it's more likely that the witness would erroneously identify a white person as black than an actual black person.

Therefore, it seems unlikely that the attacker is indeed black based on the witness's identification. However, without more information, it's difficult to provide an exact probability.

In summary, while the city's demographic proportion of black people is 15%, the witness's error rate suggests that the actual probability of the attacker being black could be lower than that. Without more specific data, it's not possible to provide a precise number.

{probability: less than 15%, but cannot provide a specific number}
