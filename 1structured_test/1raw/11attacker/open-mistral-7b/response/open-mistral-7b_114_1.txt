To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to identify race is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time, but also make errors 20% of the time.

When the witness sees a person who is actually white, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time. Similarly, when they see a person who is actually black, they mistakenly identify them as white 20% of the time.

Since the city is 85% white, the probability that the witness sees a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Similarly, since the city is 15% black, the probability that the witness sees a black person is 0.15. Therefore, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 or 3%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both the possibility that the attacker is actually black and the possibility that the witness made a mistake.

The probability that the attacker is actually black is 0.15. The probability that the witness made a mistake and identified a white person as black is 0.17.

Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities to find the total probability of the witness identifying a black person when the actual person is either black or mistakenly identified as black: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32 or 32%.

However, the witness's identification contradicts the statistical racial composition of the city, which is 85% white. This suggests that the witness is more likely to have made a mistake than to have correctly identified a black attacker.

Therefore, it is more likely that the witness made a mistake and identified a white person as black than that the attacker is actually black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black is less than 15%, the racial composition of the city.

However, without more information, it is impossible to provide a precise estimate. Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker is black is likely less than 0.15, but an exact number cannot be determined.

{probability: less than 0.15, please consider this an estimate with a high degree of uncertainty}
