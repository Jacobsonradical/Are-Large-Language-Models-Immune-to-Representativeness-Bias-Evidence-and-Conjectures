To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen, we cannot rule out the possibility that the witness is erring this time as well. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually black, plus the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually white.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W).

Given the information provided:
1. P(B) + P(W) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities)
2. The witness correctly identifies a race 80% of the time, so P(B) * 0.8 + P(W) * 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black in 80% of the cases where the attacker was black)
3. 85% of the population is white, so P(W) = 0.85

Now we can solve for P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 - 0.8 * 0.85) / (1 - 0.2)
P(B) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(B) â‰ˆ 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 15%. However, we should keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the given information and the assumptions made.
