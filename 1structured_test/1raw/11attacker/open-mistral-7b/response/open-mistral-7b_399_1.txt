Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let's denote the following:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information as 15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race (given in the second piece of information as 0.8)
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race (given in the second piece of information as 0.2)
- P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (which we're trying to find)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A) and P(B|A), so we need to find P(B).

First, let's compute P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white)

Then, using the given information about the witness's ability to identify race, we can write:

P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now we can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1765 = 0.2965

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.2965 or 29.65%.
