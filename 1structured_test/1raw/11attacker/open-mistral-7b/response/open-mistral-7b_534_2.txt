To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which we know is 0.8 (or 80%).

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the probability of an attacker being black in the population. We don't have this information directly, but we can estimate it using the population statistics provided. Since 15% of the population is black, this is our initial estimate.

3. P(E): The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is the same as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H means not black. We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|~H), so we'll assume that the witness is equally accurate in identifying attackers of different races, which means P(E|H) = P(E|~H). In this case, P(E) is equal to the sum of the product of the witness's accuracy and the proportion of black and white attackers.

However, we're given that the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% for black people and 20% for white people. Since the population is half white and half black, we can calculate the overall accuracy of the witness as follows:

P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So P(E) is approximately 29%.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.448

Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 44.8%.
