Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the prior probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of A is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%). The prior probability of B is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of not A (the attacker is white), multiplied by the witness's ability to correctly identify the race: 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.248 + 0.704 = 0.948

The probability of B given A is the witness's ability to correctly identify the race, which is 0.8 (80%). The probability of B given not A is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now we can calculate the probability of A given B using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.948
â‰ˆ 0.1301

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.01%.
