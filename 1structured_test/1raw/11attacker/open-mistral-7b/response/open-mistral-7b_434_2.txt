To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote:
- P(B): Probability that the attacker is black
- P(W): Probability that the attacker is white
- P(W|B): Probability that the witness identifies a black person as white
- P(B|W): Probability that the witness identifies a white person as black

We know that P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) + P(W) = 1.

From the witness's reliability, we have:
P(W|B) + P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.2 (20% error rate)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(W|B) or P(B|W). Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate P(B):

P(B|Witness) = P(Witness|B) * P(B) / [P(Witness|B) * P(B) + P(Witness|W) * P(W)]

We know P(Witness|B) = 0.2 (error rate), P(B) = 0.15 (from the city's population), but we don't have enough information to calculate P(W|Witness) and P(W).

Given that the question asks for an estimate of P(B), we can provide an approximate answer based on the given information. However, this estimation might be inaccurate due to missing information.

Assuming that a black person is equally likely to be misidentified as white as a white person is to be misidentified as black, we can use P(W|B) = 0.2 and P(B|W) = 0.2 as an approximation. But this is an assumption that may not hold in reality.

Using these approximations, we can calculate P(B|Witness):

P(B|Witness) = 0.2 * 0.15 / [0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.15 / 0.33 = 0.4545

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.45 or 45%. However, this estimate might be inaccurate due to the assumptions made.
