The probability of the attacker being black, given the evidence, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, times the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let's break this down:
1. H: The attacker is black
2. E: The witness identified the attacker as black
3. P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black, which can be estimated from the city's demographics (15% black, as per information "b")
4. P(E|H): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's reliability, which is 0.8 (80% correct)
5. P(E|~H): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This can be estimated as the complement of the witness's reliability when the attacker is black, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% correct)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 16.67%. This means that despite the witness's identification, the attacker is still more likely to be white, given the city's demographics. However, the witness's identification should not be disregarded completely, as the witness's reliability is relatively high.
