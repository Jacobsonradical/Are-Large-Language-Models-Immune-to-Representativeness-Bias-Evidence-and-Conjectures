Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is given as 0.8 (from the first piece of information).

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given as 0.15 (from the second piece of information, since 85% of the population is white).

The probability of the witness identifying any person as black given that they are not black (P(B|not A)) is the complement of the error rate, which is 0.2.

The probability of the witness identifying any person as black (P(B)) is the sum of the probability of them being black and incorrectly identified, and the probability of them not being black and correctly identified: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
