To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement, and our prior probability is the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (the event A)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is not black)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (the complementary event)

We are given that:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying black people)

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.42

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.42 or 42%. This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.
