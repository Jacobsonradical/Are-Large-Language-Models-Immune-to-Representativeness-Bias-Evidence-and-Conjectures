Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness has identified the attacker as black, which means they either correctly identified the attacker's race or made an error. Since we don't know which case applies, we can't be certain about the attacker's race. However, we can calculate the probabilities of both scenarios and use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black.

Let's denote:
- E: event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race
- F: event that the attacker is black
- ¬F: event that the attacker is not black (white in this case)

We are given:
- P(E|F) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(E|¬F) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
- P(F) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black)
- P(¬F) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is white)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(F|E) = P(E|F) * P(F) / [P(E|F) * P(F) + P(E|¬F) * P(¬F)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(F|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probabilities, we get:

P(F|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(F|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(F|E) ≈ 0.4137

So, based on the given information and assuming that the witness's identification is correct, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4137. However, without knowing whether the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the attacker's race.
