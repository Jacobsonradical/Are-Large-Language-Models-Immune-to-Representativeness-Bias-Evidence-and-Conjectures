To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness testimony)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness testimony)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
- P(E) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence (total probability of the witness giving the testimony, regardless of the attacker's race)

From the information given, we can calculate the values for each component of Bayes' theorem as follows:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)): The information given states that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

2. Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person (P(E|H)): The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. Marginal likelihood of the witness giving the testimony (P(E)): Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness testimony:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.16 = 0.5625

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.5625 or 56.25%.
