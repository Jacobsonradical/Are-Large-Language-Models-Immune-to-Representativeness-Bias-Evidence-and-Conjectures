Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's demographic data and the witness's testimony.

1. City demographic data: The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white, given the majority population.

2. Witness testimony: The witness, despite not being very reliable (correctly identifying race 80% of the time), identified the attacker as black.

Given these two pieces of evidence, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(A) is the probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black, independent of the witness's testimony)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, independent of the attacker's race)

However, we only have the values for P(A), P(B|A), and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker). We can use the given information to calculate P(B|A) and P(B|not A).

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker 20% of the time)

P(A) is the population proportion of blacks, which is 0.15.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any attacker (regardless of race) as black. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker (P(B|A)) and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker (P(B|not A)).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, given the city's demographic data and the witness's testimony, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34.
