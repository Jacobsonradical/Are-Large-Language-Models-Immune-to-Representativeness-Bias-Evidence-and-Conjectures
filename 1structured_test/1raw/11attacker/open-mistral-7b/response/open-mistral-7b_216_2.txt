Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time.
2. The racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The witness identified the attacker as black, so we can write an equation based on the witness's ability to correctly identify race:

P(black) * 0.8 + P(not black) * 0.2 = 1 (where P(not black) is the probability that the attacker is not black, i.e., white)

Now, we can use the given racial distribution of the city to find P(not black):

P(not black) = 0.85 (probability of being white)

Substitute this into the equation:

P(black) * 0.8 + 0.85 * P(black) * 0.2 = 1

Simplify the equation:

P(black) * 0.8 + 0.17 * P(black) = 1

Solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.625

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.625 or 62.5%.
