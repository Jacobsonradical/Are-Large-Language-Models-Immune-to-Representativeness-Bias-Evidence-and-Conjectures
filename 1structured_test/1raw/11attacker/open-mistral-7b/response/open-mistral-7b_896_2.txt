To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.
- P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black.

From the provided information, we know that:
1. P(B) + P(~B) = 1
2. P(W|B) = 0.8
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2

We also know that the city's racial distribution is 85% white and 15% black. So, we can infer that P(B) = 0.15 and P(~B) = 0.85, given that the attacker's race cannot be determined from the victim's perspective.

Now, let's calculate P(W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black or non-black:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Since the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race and found that they are correct 80% of the time, we can assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black given the witness's report is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) / P(W) = 0.8 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.276

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report and the city's racial distribution, is approximately 0.276, or 27.6%.
