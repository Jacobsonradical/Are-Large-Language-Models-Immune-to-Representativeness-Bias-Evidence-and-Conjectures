Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker (which is a simplification and may not be accurate in real-world scenarios), we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement and the city's demographics.

The witness stated that the attacker is black. The probability of this being a correct identification is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability of this happening is the error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is therefore 0.85 (or 85%).

Since the witness's error rate is 0.2 and the city's white population proportion is 0.85, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Adding this to the probability of a correct identification, we get the overall probability of the attacker being black: 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97 (or 97%).

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes several simplifications, such as the witness's race identification ability being independent of the actual race of the attacker, and that the city's demographics accurately reflect the population from which the attacker was drawn. In real-world scenarios, these assumptions may not hold, and the calculation may be less reliable.
