To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to result in misidentifying a black person as white or a white person as black, we can calculate the probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is black as follows:

Probability of witness error given attacker is black = Probability of witness misidentifying attacker as white = 0.2

Similarly, the probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is white is also 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, by using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

Substituting the given values:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the values:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
