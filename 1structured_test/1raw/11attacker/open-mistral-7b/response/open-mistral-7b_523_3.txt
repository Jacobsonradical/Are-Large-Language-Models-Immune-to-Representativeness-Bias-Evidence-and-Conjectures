Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person.

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given in the second piece of information as 15% (0.15). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person if the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is given in the first piece of information as 0.8 (80%). Similarly, the likelihood of the witness identifying a black person if the attacker is not black (P(B|not A)) is given as 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.316

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.316 or 31.6%.
