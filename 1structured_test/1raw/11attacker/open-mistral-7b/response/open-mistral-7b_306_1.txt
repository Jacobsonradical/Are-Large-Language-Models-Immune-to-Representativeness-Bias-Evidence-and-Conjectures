To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that there is a 0.8 chance that the actual attacker is also black (assuming the witness's identification is correct). However, there is also a 0.2 chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness's identification is correct, which is 0.8. However, we need to adjust this probability to account for the fact that the attacker might actually be white and the witness made an error.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = P(Witness's identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / [P(Witness's identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness's identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.15 / 0.21 = 0.714

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.714 or 71.4%.
