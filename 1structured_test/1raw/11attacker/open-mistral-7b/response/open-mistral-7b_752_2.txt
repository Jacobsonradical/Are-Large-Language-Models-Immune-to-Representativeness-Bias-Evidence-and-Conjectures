Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of H, P(H), which is the probability of the attacker being black in the population. This is what we want to calculate.
2. The conditional probability of E given H, P(E|H), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 0.8.
3. The conditional probability of E given not-H, P(E|not-H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. This is given as 0.2, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

P(not-H) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white).

Substituting the given values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * P(H) / [0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Since we want to calculate P(H|E), we can solve for P(H):

P(H) = [P(H|E) * 0.85] / 0.8

Substituting the given value of P(H|E) = 0.8 into the equation:

P(H) = [0.8 * 0.85] / 0.8 = 0.68

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.68 or 68%.
