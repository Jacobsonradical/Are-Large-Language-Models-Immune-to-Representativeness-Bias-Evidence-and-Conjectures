To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker being black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification).
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so this is 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white.

To find P(E), we can use the base rate fallacy, which states that the probability of an event should not be ignored even if it seems irrelevant to the current situation. In this case, the base rate for the attacker being black is 15%, as stated in the second piece of information.

However, we also need to consider that the witness makes errors 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, the probability of the witness making any identification is the sum of the correct identifications and the incorrect identifications of the opposite race:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.211

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.211 â‰ˆ 0.612

So, based on the witness's identification and the error rate, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.612 or 61.2%.
