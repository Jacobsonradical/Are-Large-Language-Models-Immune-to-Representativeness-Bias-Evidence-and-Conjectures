To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (what we believe before seeing new evidence) based on the observed evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing B given that A is true
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of observing B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the observed evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black is given in the information as 15%. So P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is given in the information as 80%. So P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. P(B): The probability of the witness identifying someone as black is a weighted average of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that the attacker is not black). We know P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from the information). So P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.194.

4. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.194 â‰ˆ 0.416.

So, given the information and assumptions, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.416 or 41.6%.
