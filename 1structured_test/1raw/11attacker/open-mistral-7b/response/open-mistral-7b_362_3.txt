In this situation, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race. However, we know the racial composition of the city.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states the probability of an event A (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence B (in this case, the witness identifying the attacker as black) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event times the probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let's break it down:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (85% white, 15% black).
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is 80% reliable, this is 0.8.
- P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness is 20% unreliable, this is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
- P(~A) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.212

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.561

So, our estimate is that there is approximately a 56.1% probability that the attacker is black.
