Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that when they saw a person who was actually white, they mistakenly identified them as black 20% of the time.

Since 85% of the city's population is white, we can expect that the attacker is white 85% of the time. The witness's mistake of identifying a white person as black occurs 20% of the time.

Therefore, the probability that the witness's mistake corresponds to the real situation (the attacker is white but the witness misidentified him as black) is 20%.

However, we should consider that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 20% of the time. In this case, the attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified this.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of a correct identification and the probability of a mistake being the real situation, divided by 100% (to ensure the probability sums to 100%):

(20% correct identification) + (20% mistake being the real situation) = 40%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4 or 40%.
