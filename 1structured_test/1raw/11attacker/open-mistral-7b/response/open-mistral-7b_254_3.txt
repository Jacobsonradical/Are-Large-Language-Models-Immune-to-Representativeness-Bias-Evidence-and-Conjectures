Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence (probability of the witness identifying someone as black)

We are given the following values:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(A) = Unknown (priority probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A)) (probability of the witness identifying someone as black)

We cannot directly calculate P(A) from the information given, but we can solve for P(A|B) in terms of P(A).

Let's first calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A))

Now, we can solve for P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * P(A) / [0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A))]

To find P(A|B), we can plot the equation as a function of P(A) and find the value that satisfies P(A|B) = 1 (if such a value exists). However, without additional information or making an assumption about P(A), it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.
