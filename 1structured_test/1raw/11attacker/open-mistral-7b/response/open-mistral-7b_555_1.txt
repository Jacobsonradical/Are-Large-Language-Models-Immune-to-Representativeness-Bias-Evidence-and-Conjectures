To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (0.80 from the data)
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (0.20 from the data)
- P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
- P(not B) = 0.85

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability P(B|W) can be calculated as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(B|W) = (0.80) * (0.15) / [(0.80) * (0.15) + (0.20) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is around 0.25 or 25%.
