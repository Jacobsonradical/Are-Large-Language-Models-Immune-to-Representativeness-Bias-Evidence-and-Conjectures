To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we are interested in is the attacker's race (black or white), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(Black) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(White) as the probability that the attacker is white,
- P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker,
- P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white attacker as black.

From the information given, we know that:
P(Black) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
P(White) = 0.85

Also, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so:
P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) = 0.2

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so:
P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) * P(White)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) â‰ˆ 0.42

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.42 or 42%.
