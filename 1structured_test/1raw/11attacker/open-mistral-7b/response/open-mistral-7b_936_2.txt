Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for calculating conditional probabilities, and in this case, it allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation and the population distribution.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified a black person

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population distribution shows that 15% of the city's population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)
  P(not A) = 0.85 (the population distribution shows that 85% of the city's population is white)

Calculating P(B) gives:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula gives:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, given the witness's observation and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
