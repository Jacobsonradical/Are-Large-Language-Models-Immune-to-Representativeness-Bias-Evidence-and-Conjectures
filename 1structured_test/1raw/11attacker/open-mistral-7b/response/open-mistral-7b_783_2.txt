To provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Bayes' theorem is given by P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness would identify someone as black if the attacker is indeed black),
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence), and
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness would give the testimony, regardless of the attacker's race).

Given the information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85 = 0.12 (calculated by considering that the witness would identify someone as black with probability 0.8 when the attacker is black, and with probability 0.2 when the attacker is not black)

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.6923

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.6923 or 69.23%.
