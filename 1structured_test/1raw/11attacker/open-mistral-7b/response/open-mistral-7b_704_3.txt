To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Let's denote:
- P(W) as the probability that the witness is correct (the attacker is black)
- P(F) as the probability that the witness is wrong (the attacker is white)

We know that P(W) + P(F) = 1, and P(W) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)

We also know that the probability of picking a white person at random is 0.85 (from the city's population composition). If the witness errs, she mistakes a white person for a black one. So, the probability of the witness erring, P(F), is equal to the probability of picking a white person, times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

P(F) = P(white) * P(witness mistakes white as black)

We know P(white) = 0.85 and P(witness mistakes white as black) = 0.2. So, we can calculate P(F) as follows:

P(F) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now we can find P(W) by subtracting P(F) from 1:

P(W) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
