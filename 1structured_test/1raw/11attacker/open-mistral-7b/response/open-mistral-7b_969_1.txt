Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on two factors: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

We need to adjust the city's racial composition based on the witness's error rate. If the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, they are effectively "seeing" 80% of the white population as black and 20% of the black population as white. This means that the "effective" racial composition of the city, as seen by the witness, is not 85% white and 15% black, but rather a different proportion.

Let x be the proportion of the population that the witness identifies as black. Then the proportion that the witness identifies as white is 1 - x. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the actual proportion of black people in the city is 0.8x. The actual proportion of white people is 0.2(1 - x).

We know that the actual proportion of black people is 0.15, so we can set up an equation:

0.8x = 0.15

Solving for x, we get x = 0.1875. This means that the witness, on average, identifies 18.75% of the population as black, even though the actual population is 15% black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the proportion of the population that the witness identifies as black, which is 0.1875 or 18.75%.

{probability: 0.1875}
