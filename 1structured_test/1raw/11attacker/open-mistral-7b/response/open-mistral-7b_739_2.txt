To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case, H is the event that the attacker is black, and E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. Let's break this down:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that we don't have any initial information, we can assume this is equal to the proportion of blacks in the city, which is 15% (from info b).

2. P(E|H): This is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black given that the attacker is actually black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (from info a).

3. P(E|~H): This is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). Since the witness errs in 20% of cases (from info a), and 85% of the population is white (from info b), the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 20% * 85% = 17%.

4. P(~H): This is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (from info b).

5. P(E): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|~H) * P(~H).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [P(E)]

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
     = 0.126 + 0.1484
     = 0.2744

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2744
       = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.12, or 12%.
