To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness's erroneous identification could either result in misidentifying a white person as black (a false positive) or misidentifying a black person as white (a false negative). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we should assume that 10% of the time, they misidentify a white person as black (false positive) and 10% of the time, they misidentify a black person as white (false negative).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two scenarios:

a) The attacker is genuinely black. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. The probability of this scenario is the actual proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

b) The attacker is white, and the witness made a mistake, misidentifying the attacker as black. This would be a false positive. The probability of this scenario is the witness's error rate for misidentifying a white person as black, which is 10%.

The total probability of the attacker being black (either genuinely black or mistakenly identified as black) is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 15% (actual proportion of black people) + 10% (witness's false positive rate), probability: 0.25}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 25%.
