To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race. Then, the probability that the attacker is actually white given the witness's mistake is the proportion of white people in the city. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that the attacker is white in 20% of the erroneous cases.

On the other hand, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's mistake is the proportion of black people in the city. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that the attacker is black in 80% of the erroneous cases.

The total probability that the attacker is white is the sum of the probabilities that the attacker is white given no error and the probabilities that the attacker is white given an error.

The probability that the attacker is white given no error is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85.

The probability that the attacker is white given an error is 0.2 (the probability of error) times the proportion of white people in the city (given an error), which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, the total probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 + 0.17 = 0.92.

The probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - 0.92 = 0.08.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.08}.
