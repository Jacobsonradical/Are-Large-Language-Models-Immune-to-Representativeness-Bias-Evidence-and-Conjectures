Based on the information provided, here's how we can reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% under similar conditions. This means that the witness makes errors 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. But since we cannot be certain that the witness did not make an error, we cannot conclude based on this single piece of evidence that the attacker is definitely black.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the possibility of the witness's error. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, it could be that the actual attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified them as black.
5. We don't have enough information to determine the exact probability, but we can make an educated guess. If we assume that the witness's error rate is constant, regardless of the actual race of the person, then the probability of the attacker being black is equal to the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Final answer: {probability: 0.2}

This answer assumes that the witness's error rate is constant and that the witness is equally likely to make an error when identifying a white person as a black one. However, this might not be the case in reality. For a more accurate estimate, additional information would be needed, such as the witness's error rate when identifying white people as black.
