To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black as Q. Then, the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is (1 - Q).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of a random person being white as P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15.

The witness said the attacker was black, but we don't know if this is a correct identification or a mistake. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is P(B|W'B) = (1 - Q), where W'B represents the event "witness says black and attacker is indeed black."

We know that when presented with a random person, the witness correctly identifies their race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, Q = 0.2 and (1 - Q) = 0.8.

The total probability of the witness saying the attacker is black, whether the attacker is actually black or white, is P(W'B) = P(B|W'B) * P(B) + P(W'not B) * P(not B).

Given that P(B) = 0.15, we can set up the equation:

P(W'B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * P(not B)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(not B), but we can still find the ratio of P(W'B) to P(W'W), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is white.

The ratio of these probabilities is:

P(W'B) / P(W'W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [P(W'W) * P(W)]

By setting P(W'B) / P(W'W) equal to the witness's reported probability of identifying a black person as black (0.8), we can solve for P(W'W):

P(W'W) = (1 - 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8)

Now, we can find the estimate of P(B) by multiplying P(W'B) by P(B) / P(W'B):

{probability: 0.15 * (0.8) / P(W'W), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Unfortunately, we cannot calculate a specific probability without knowing P(W'W). However, we can conclude that the probability of the attacker being black is likely lower than 15% but probably higher than the witness's error rate of 20%. Without more information, a definitive estimate cannot be given.
