To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's report.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as P(black|witness), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as P(white|witness). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we have:

P(white|witness) = 0.2

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we have:

P(black|witness) = 0.8

Now, let P(black) be the actual probability that the attacker is black. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is:

P(white) = 0.85

We know that the probability of the witness's report (being black) given that the attacker is black is P(black|witness), and the probability of the witness's report given that the attacker is white is P(white|witness). Since the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, we have:

P(witness|black) = P(black)
P(witness|white) = P(white|witness)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness's report given the actual probability of the attacker's race:

P(witness|black) = P(black)
P(witness|white) = 0.2

Since the witness reported that the attacker is black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's report:

P(black|witness) = P(black) / (P(black) + P(white|witness))

We can substitute the values we have:

P(black|witness) = P(black) / (P(black) + 0.2)

Now, we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.8 * (P(black) + 0.2) / 1
0.2 * P(black) = 0.16
P(black) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is 0.8 or 80%. However, we should note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person, which may not always be the case.
