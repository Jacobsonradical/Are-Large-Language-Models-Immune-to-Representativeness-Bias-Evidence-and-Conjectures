To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the provided information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H means not black)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|~H) and P(~H), so we can't calculate P(E) directly. However, we can make an assumption to approximate P(E).

If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, then P(E|~H) = 0.8 (the same as P(E|H)). This assumption means that the witness's error rate is constant regardless of the attacker's race.

With this assumption, we can simplify P(E) as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the actual population percentage of black people in the city, which suggests that the witness's identification may not be reliable.
