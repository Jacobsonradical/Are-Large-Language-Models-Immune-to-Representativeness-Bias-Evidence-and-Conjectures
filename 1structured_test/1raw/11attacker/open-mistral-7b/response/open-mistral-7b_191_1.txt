To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, and according to information (b), 85% of the city's population is white.

So, when the witness sees a white person, there is a 20% chance that they will incorrectly identify them as black. Since 85% of the population is white, the total number of times the witness sees a white person and misidentifies them as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, the witness identifies the attacker as black. Since they have a higher chance of misidentifying a white person as black than of correctly identifying a black person, this misidentification is more likely to occur with a white attacker than a black one.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the complement of the probability that the attacker is white and the witness misidentifies them as black.

The probability that the attacker is white is 1 - 15% = 0.85. The probability that the witness misidentifies a white attacker as black is 0.17.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.67 or 67%.

In summary, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.67} or 67%.
