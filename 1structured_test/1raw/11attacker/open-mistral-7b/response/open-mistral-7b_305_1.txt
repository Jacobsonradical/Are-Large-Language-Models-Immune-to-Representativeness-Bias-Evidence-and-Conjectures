Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

1. The probability of the witness making a correct identification (attacker is black) is the probability of the attacker being black times the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks. So, 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12.
2. The probability of the witness making an error (attacker is white) is the probability of the attacker being white times the witness's error rate. So, 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17.
3. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, so we want the probability of this error happening, not the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker.
4. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.17.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.17}.
