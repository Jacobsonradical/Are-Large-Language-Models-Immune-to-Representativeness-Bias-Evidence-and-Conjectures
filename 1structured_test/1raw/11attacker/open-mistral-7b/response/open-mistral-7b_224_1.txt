To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's identification is not always accurate; they correctly identify race 80% of the time and make errors 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's calculate two probabilities:

1. Probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as such: This is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
   P(Attacker is black and correct identification) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Correct identification | Attacker is black)
   = 0.15 * 0.8
   = 0.12

2. Probability that the attacker is black and the witness mistakenly identifies them as non-black: This is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as non-black.
   P(Attacker is black and incorrect identification) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Incorrect identification | Attacker is black)
   = 0.15 * 0.2
   = 0.03

The witness's testimony points to the attacker being black, but with an error rate of 20%, we should also consider the possibility that they mistakenly identified a white person as black.

Now, to find the overall probability that the attacker is black, we add the probabilities from both scenarios:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15}

The probability that the attacker is black, based on the provided information, is approximately 15%.
