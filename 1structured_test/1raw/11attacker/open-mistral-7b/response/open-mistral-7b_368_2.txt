To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness makes a correct identification 80% of the time, regardless of the race of the person)

First, let's calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, and there are equal numbers of white and black people, this means there are also equal numbers of times the witness correctly identifies a white person (1 - 0.8 = 0.2). So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(E), the probability of the witness making a correct identification, regardless of the race of the person. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and a white person 20% of the time, the overall probability of making a correct identification is the weighted average of these two probabilities: P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Using the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%. This means that, given the evidence of the witness's identification, we believe there is a 27.5% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information, and actual probabilities may vary depending on other factors.
