Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, we can only use this witness's testimony as our data point.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black in 20% of the cases when the actual race was white. This means they correctly identified the race 80% of the time, which includes both correct identifications of black people and incorrect identifications of white people as black.

Since 85% of the population is white, the number of times the witness correctly identified a white person as white would be higher than the number of times they correctly identified a black person as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is the proportion of times the witness correctly identified a black person as black.

To find this proportion, we need to know how many times the witness made a correct identification of a black person. However, we are given only the total number of correct identifications and the total number of incorrect identifications. Without knowing the exact number of each, we cannot provide a precise probability.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a numerical probability between 0 and 1 based on the information given.
