To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E | H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information given, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as black 80% of the time and incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. So, P(E | H) = 0.8.

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black). Since we don't know the exact race of the attacker, we can't directly calculate P(E). However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H | E) and then find P(E) by rearranging the equation: P(E) = P(H) * P(E | H) + P(~H) * P(E | ~H), where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

4. P(E | ~H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can assume that they will incorrectly identify a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time. So, P(E | ~H) = 0.2.

5. P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black. Since 85% of the population is white, the prior probability of the attacker not being black is P(~H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(E): P(E) = P(H) * P(E | H) + P(~H) * P(E | ~H) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12.

Finally, we can calculate P(H | E): P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.6667.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
