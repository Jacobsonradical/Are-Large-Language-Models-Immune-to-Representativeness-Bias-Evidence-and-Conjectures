Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification. The probability of the event and the prior probability of the new evidence are given in the two pieces of information.

The probability of the event (the attacker being black), P(A), is what we want to find. The probability of the new evidence given the event, P(B|A), is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person, which is 0.8 (80%). The prior probability of the new evidence, P(B), is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.85

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.153.

However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's identification. This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), which is the value we were originally trying to find.

Since the witness's identification is not reliable enough to change our initial belief about the attacker's race (the witness was only correct 80% of the time), we should continue to believe that the attacker is likely to be white, given that 85% of the population is white. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is still 0.15 (15%).

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: 0.15}
