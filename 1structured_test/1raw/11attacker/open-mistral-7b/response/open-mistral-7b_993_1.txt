Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the population is 85% white, this means the attacker is likely white. The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2.

P(A) + P(~A) = 1, so P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being white).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.524

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.524 or 52.4%.
