To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis (A) given the evidence (B)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(B) is the prior probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black (event A) as follows:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given to be 15% (0.15).
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when judging race, P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 (white attacker) + 0.8 * 0.85 (black attacker) = 0.68.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
         = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.68
         = 0.12059

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12.06%. This means that there is a slightly higher probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, but the probability that the attacker is black is still non-negligible.
