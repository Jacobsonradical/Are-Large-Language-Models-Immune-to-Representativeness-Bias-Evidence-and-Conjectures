Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that in this specific case, the witness made an error.

Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, it would be more likely for the attacker to be white. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and the attacker's race is independent of the witness's error, then the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is equal to the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying them as black is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

However, since the witness made an error, we know that the attacker is not white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is white, plus the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is black.

In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness error | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) + P(witness correct | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

Using the given probabilities, this equation simplifies to:

0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.03 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.31

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.31 or 31%.
