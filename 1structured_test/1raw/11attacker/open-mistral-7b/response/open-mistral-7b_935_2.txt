To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- A: Attacker is black
- E: Witness identifies attacker as black
- P(A): Prior probability of attacker being black (unknown)
- P(E|A): Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person as black (given in the information)
- P(E|~A): Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (given in the information)
- P(~A): Prior probability of attacker being non-black (1 - P(A))

From the information given, we have:

1. P(E|A) = 0.8
2. P(E|~A) = 0.2
3. P(A) + P(~A) = 1
4. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(~A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|E):

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Plug in the values:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculate:

P(A|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4137

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
