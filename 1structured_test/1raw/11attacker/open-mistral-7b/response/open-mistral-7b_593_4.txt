The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- ≡: The event that the witness correctly identifies the race
- ∉: The event that the witness incorrectly identifies the race
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
P(H) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)
P(≡|H) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person)
P(∉|H) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a black person)
P(≡|~H) = 0.5 (probability of correctly identifying a white person)
P(∉|~H) = 0.5 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person)

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the probabilities:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]

Calculating the numbers:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.425)
P(H|E) ≈ 0.15 / 0.545
P(H|E) ≈ 0.274

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.274 or 27.4%.
