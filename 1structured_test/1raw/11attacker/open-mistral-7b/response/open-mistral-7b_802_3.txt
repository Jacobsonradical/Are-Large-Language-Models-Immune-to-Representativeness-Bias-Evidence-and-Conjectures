Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, the probability that the actual attacker is not black is 20%.

However, we know that 85% of the city's population is white. So, the probability that the attacker is white is 1 minus the probability that the attacker is not white, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20, or 20%. However, this estimate is based on the flawed witness identification and does not account for the actual racial distribution of attackers in the city. The true probability could be higher or lower depending on the racial demographics of attackers in the area.
