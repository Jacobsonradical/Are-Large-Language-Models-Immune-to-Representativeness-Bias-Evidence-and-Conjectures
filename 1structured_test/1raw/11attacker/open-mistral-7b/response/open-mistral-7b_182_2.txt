To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and we have two pieces of information:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race (P(black | witnessed black)) is 0.8 (80%).
2. The prior probability of the attacker being black in the population (P(black)) is unknown.
3. We know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. So, P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.
4. We also know that the witness erred in 20% of the cases (P(not black | witnessed black)) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(black | witnessed black) = [P(witnessed black | black) \* P(black)] / [P(witnessed black | black) \* P(black) + P(witnessed black | not black) \* P(not black)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(black | witnessed black) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating this gives us P(black | witnessed black) â‰ˆ 0.242 or 24.2%.

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24.2%.
