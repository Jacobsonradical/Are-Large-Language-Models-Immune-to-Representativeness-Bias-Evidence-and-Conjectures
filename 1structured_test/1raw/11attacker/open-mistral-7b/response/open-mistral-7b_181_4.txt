Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct information about whether the witness's identification was correct or not.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and our evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

However, we don't have the prior probability P(H). If we assume that the prior probability is equal to the proportion of blacks in the city (given in information b), then P(H) = 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
           = [0.8 * 0.15] / [P(E)]

Unfortunately, we don't have the probability P(E) in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact probability.

To provide an estimate, we can use the value of P(E | H) (the likelihood) as an approximation:

{probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate assumes that the witness's identification was correct, which is not necessarily the case given the information provided. The actual probability could be lower or higher depending on the value of P(E).
