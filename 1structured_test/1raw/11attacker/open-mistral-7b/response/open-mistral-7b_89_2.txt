To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial makeup of the city where the incident occurred.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black and a white attacker as white.

Let's denote:

- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(witness_correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race

We are given that P(witness_correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)

Also, we are given that P(black) + P(white) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white)

Now, let's calculate P(witness_correct | black) and P(witness_correct | white):

P(witness_correct | black) = P(black) * P(witness_correct | black is true) + P(not black) * P(witness_correct | black is false)

P(black) = 0.15
P(witness_correct | black is true) = 1 (since the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black 100% of the time)
P(not black) = 0.85
P(witness_correct | black is false) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

P(witness_correct | black) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.21

Similarly, we can calculate P(witness_correct | white):

P(witness_correct | white) = P(white) * P(witness_correct | white is true) + P(not white) * P(witness_correct | white is false)

P(white) = 0.85
P(witness_correct | white is true) = 1 (since the witness correctly identifies a white attacker as white 100% of the time)
P(not white) = 0.15
P(witness_correct | white is false) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

P(witness_correct | white) = 0.85 * 1 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.87

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we can write the following equation:

P(witness_correct | black) * P(black) = P(witness_correct | observed)

We are given that P(witness_correct | observed) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black, and we assume that the witness's identification is correct)

Substituting the values, we have:

0.21 * 0.15 = 0.0315 = P(black)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 3.15%. However, this estimate is likely to be unreliable due to the witness's error rate and the limited information available. It is important to consider other evidence or factors in reaching a final conclusion.
