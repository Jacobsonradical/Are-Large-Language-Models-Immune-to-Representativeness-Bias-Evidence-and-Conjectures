To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial makeup of the city: 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black (given that the attacker is indeed black) is 0.8 (80%).

However, we must also consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified an innocent white person as the attacker. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identified him as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the two probabilities: 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker) + 0.17 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black).

So, {probability: 0.97, this is the estimated probability that the attacker is black}

This estimate considers the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial makeup of the city. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and does not guarantee the attacker's race.
