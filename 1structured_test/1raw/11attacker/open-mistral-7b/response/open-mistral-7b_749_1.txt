Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H means not black)

We are not given the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person P(E|~H), but we can calculate it from the information given. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, they must incorrectly identify a black person 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. Therefore, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.85 * x, where x is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

However, since the witness's ability to judge a person's race is consistent across races, we can assume that x = 0.2, and P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.25.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.25 * 0.85 ≈ 0.26

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.26 ≈ 0.577

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.577 or 57.7%.
