To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, our event is the attacker being black (H1), and the new evidence is the witness's identification (E). Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Where:
- P(H1|E) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification
- P(E|H1) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(H1) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H0) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black
- P(H0) is the prior probability of the attacker being non-black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H1) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(E|H0) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(H1) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(H0) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(H1|E):

P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.227

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22.7%.
