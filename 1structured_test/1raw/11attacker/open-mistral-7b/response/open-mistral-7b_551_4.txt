To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black:

The probability of a black attacker is 15% (from the city's population statistics). The witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness might mistake a white attacker for a black one. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is the sum of the two probabilities: 0.12 (correctly identifying a black attacker) and 0.17 (mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black), which equals 0.29 or 29%.

In summary:
{probability: 0.29}
