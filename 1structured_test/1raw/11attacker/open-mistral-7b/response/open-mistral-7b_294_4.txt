To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, since we don't know if the witness erred in this case or not, we can't directly use this information to adjust the initial racial demographics.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness couldn't see the attacker's race, we should consider these proportions as our prior probability.

However, the witness's identification adds some new information. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

1. The attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

The probability of the first event (the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race) is the probability of the attacker being black times the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. The probability of the second event (the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identified the race) is the probability of the attacker being white times the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Given the witness's reliability, the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies white people 80% of the time).

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%) and the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%).

Therefore, the probability of the first event (the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of the second event (the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identified the race) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black given this evidence is the probability of the first event divided by the sum of the probabilities of both events: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41 (41%).

However, it's important to note that this is a Bayesian estimate, and it assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race. If this assumption is not valid, the estimate may be incorrect.
