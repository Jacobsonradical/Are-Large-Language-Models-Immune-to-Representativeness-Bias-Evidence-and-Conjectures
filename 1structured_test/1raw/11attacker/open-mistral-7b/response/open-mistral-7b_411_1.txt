Based on the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black, and their ability to correctly identify race was assessed at 80% under similar conditions.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker's race as black by multiplying the witness's accuracy rate by the actual proportion of black people in the city.

The probability that the attacker is black = Witness's accuracy rate * Proportion of black people in the city
                                                       = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                       = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This means that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
