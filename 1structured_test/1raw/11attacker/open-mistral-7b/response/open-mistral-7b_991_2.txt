To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but in this case, they mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that when the attacker was actually white, the witness mistakenly identified them as black 20% of the time (since they are correct 80% of the time).

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, this means that 15% of the population is black. If the witness was incorrectly identifying a white person as black 20% of the time, then the actual probability that the attacker was black, given the witness's observation, is the inverse of this error rate:

{probability: 0.2 / 0.20 = 0.1, or 10%}

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is the same for both white and black people, which may not be the case. In reality, the true probability could be higher or lower than 10%. This calculation simply provides a rough estimate based on the given information.
