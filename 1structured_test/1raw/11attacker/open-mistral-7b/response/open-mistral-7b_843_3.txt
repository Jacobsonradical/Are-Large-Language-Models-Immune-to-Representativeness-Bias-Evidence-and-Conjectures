Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs in the presence of new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker was black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population of the city is 15% black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making this identification)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.667, or 66.7%.
