To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, which means they mistakenly identify a white person as black 20% of the time they encounter a white person. Since half of the population is white (85% white + 15% black = 100%, so 85% = 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.425 white), the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 0.2 * 0.425 = 0.085 times out of each identification.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that their identification is correct is 1 minus the probability of their identification being wrong. So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

1 - 0.085 = 0.915

This means that there is a 91.5% probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification and their reliability in racial identification.

The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's identification. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is simply 0.15, or 15%.

However, since we now know that the witness identified the attacker as black and they are reliable in their racial identifications, it would be unreasonable to ignore this information. Therefore, a more accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.915, or 91.5%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.915}.
