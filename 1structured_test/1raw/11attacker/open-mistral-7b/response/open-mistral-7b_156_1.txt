Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly by the victim, we can only consider the error rate as a source of uncertainty.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's error rate is a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's error.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is black and B is the event that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness mistakes a black person for a white person, given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.2.

Next, let's calculate P(A), which is the probability that the attacker is black. Given the city's population, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(B), which is the probability that the witness mistakes any person for the other race. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black, P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.135.

So, given the witness's error rate and the city's population, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.5%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is a random event, which may not be the case in real-world situations. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation and not a definitive answer.
