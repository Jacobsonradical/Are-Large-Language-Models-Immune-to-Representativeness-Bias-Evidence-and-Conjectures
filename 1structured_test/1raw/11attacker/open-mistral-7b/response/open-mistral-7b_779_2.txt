Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black, as we do not know if the witness made an error in this case.

However, we can make an estimate by considering the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white. In this case, the chance that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black is 20%, given the witness's error rate.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is actually white and the witness made an error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Given that we cannot rule out this possibility, it would be conservative to consider it when making an estimate. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.17 = {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.

This estimate suggests that there is an 83% chance that the attacker is black, based on the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, but with the caveat that the witness could have made an error.
