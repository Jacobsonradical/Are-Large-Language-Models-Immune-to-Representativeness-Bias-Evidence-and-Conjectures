Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of H, P(H), which is the probability of the attacker being black in the population. This is what we want to calculate.
2. The conditional probability of E given H, P(E|H), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 0.8.
3. The conditional probability of E given not-H, P(E|not-H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This is given as 0.2.
4. The prior probability of not-H, P(not-H), which is the probability of the attacker being white in the population. This can be calculated as 1 - P(H).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|not-H) = 0.2, and P(not-H) = 1 - P(H).

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. So, P(H) = 0.15, and P(not-H) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of P(H|E) = 0.3571 or 35.71%.

So, given the evidence, there is a 35.71% probability that the attacker is black.
