To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. City demographics: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness's error rate can be considered as a form of "false positive" rate. Since the witness mistakenly identifies whites as black 20% of the time, the actual proportion of black attackers in the city might be higher than the 15% reported.

Let's denote the true proportion of black attackers as P. Then, the 80% correct identification rate for black attackers can be represented as P * (1 - 0.20) due to the false positive rate.

The 85% white population proportion can be represented as (1 - P) * (1 - 0.20) due to the false positive rate.

We have two equations based on the given information:

P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80
(1 - P) * (1 - 0.20) = 0.85

By solving these two equations, we find that P â‰ˆ 0.23.

Given that the attacker's race was incorrectly identified, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately:
