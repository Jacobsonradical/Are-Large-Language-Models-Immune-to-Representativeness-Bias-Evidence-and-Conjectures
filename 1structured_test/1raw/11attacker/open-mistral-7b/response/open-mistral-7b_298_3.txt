To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial makeup of the population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can assume that their judgments are not perfectly reliable. However, the fact that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black suggests that the attacker was likely black, even if the witness's judgment is not always accurate.

Furthermore, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. Given this information, and assuming that the attacker is randomly selected from the population, we can use the witness's reliability to make a probability estimate.

If we assume that the witness made a correct identification, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the probability they gave, based on their own judgment). If we assume that the witness made an error, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population).

Since we know that the witness made a correct identification, we can use their reliability as a kind of weight to adjust our estimate. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (or 64%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.64} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the given information.
