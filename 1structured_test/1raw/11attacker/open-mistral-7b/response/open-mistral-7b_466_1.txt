Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the statistics, 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness, who has an 80% success rate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

Without additional information, it seems that the witness's identification of the attacker as black should carry some weight in our estimation, given the witness's high success rate.

So, our estimate would be:
{probability: 0.8}

This means that, given the information we have, we estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8 or 80%.
