To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a black person as white and vice versa, then the probability of a correct identification given that the person is black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of a correct identification given that the person is white is 0.2 (20%).

The proportion of black people in the city is 0.15 (15%). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probabilities of the witness making an error and identifying a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
