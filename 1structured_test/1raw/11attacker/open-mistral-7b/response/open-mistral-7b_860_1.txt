Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not always reliable in identifying race, has identified the attacker as black. The witness's error rate in identifying race is 20%, meaning they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

Given this, it's important to consider both the population demographics and the witness's unreliability. If the attacker was indeed black, the witness would correctly identify them 80% of the time. However, if the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time (given their error rate).

To account for both scenarios, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the city's demographics. Let P(B) be the probability of the attacker being black and P(W|B) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker. Similarly, let P(W|non-B) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black.

Given the information, we have:
1. P(B) = probability of attacker being black
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3. P(W|non-B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

The witness has identified the attacker as black, so we are interested in the probability of this event given that the attacker is black (P(W|B)) and the probability of this event given that the attacker is not black (P(W|non-B)). We can calculate these probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|non-B) * P(non-B)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this expression gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the city's demographics:
