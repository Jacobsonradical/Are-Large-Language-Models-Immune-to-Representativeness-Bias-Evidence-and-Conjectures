Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's define our events:
- H0: The attacker is white
- H1: The attacker is black

The prior probability of H0 (the probability of an attacker being white before any evidence) is 0.85 (from information "a"). The prior probability of H1 (the probability of an attacker being black before any evidence) is 0.15 (from information "a").

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (H0) is the error rate, which is 0.2 (from information "b"). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (H1) is the accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (from information "b").

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Where E is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Plugging in the numbers:

P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.2682 or 26.82% that the attacker is black.

So, in dictionary format: {probability: 0.2682}
