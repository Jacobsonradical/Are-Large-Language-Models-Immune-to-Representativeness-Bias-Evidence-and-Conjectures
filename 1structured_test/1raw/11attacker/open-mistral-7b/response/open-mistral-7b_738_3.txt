Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(Black) = P(Black | Witness's Statement) * P(Witness's Statement | Black) / P(Witness's Statement)

We know P(Black | Witness's Statement) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy rate), P(Witness's Statement | Black) = 1 (since the witness made a statement), and P(Witness's Statement) = P(Black) * P(Witness's Statement | Black) + P(Not Black) * P(Witness's Statement | Not Black)

We know P(Not Black) = 1 - P(Black) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (from the city's population statistics), and P(Witness's Statement | Not Black) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem and solving for P(Black) gives us:

P(Black) = (0.8 * 1) / (0.8 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2)

P(Black) â‰ˆ 0.78

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 78%.
