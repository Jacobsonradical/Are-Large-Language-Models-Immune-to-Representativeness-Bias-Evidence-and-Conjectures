To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the population statistics: P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

2. P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This value is provided in the information: P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

3. P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being not black, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.235 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time).

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.235 * 0.85 ≈ 0.209.

So, the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.209 ≈ 0.577.

In other words, given the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 57.7%.
