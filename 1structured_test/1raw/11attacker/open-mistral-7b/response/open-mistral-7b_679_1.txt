To provide an estimate, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony in conjunction with the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, if the witness's identification was entirely random, we would expect the witness to get it wrong more often when identifying a black person because they are less common.

However, the witness has a success rate of 80% in correctly identifying race. This means that even though they are less common, the witness is more likely to correctly identify a black person as such than to incorrectly label a white person as black.

Given these facts, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

1. If the witness's identification was completely random, we would expect the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker to be lower than 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).
2. However, we know the witness's success rate is 80%. This means that, even though the attacker's race was not observed directly, the witness's identification of the attacker as black increases the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is estimated to be higher than 15% but lower than 80%. To calculate an exact number, we would need more information, such as the specific error rates for misidentifying black people as white and white people as black.
