Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(Attacker is black) as the probability that the attacker is black, which we want to estimate.
- P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.
- P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This can be calculated as 1 - P(Witness says white | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white) / P(Witness says black), where P(Witness says white | Attacker is white) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person, which is given as 0.8, and P(Attacker is white) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 0.85.
- P(Attacker is white) as the probability that the attacker is white, which is given as 0.85.
- P(Witness says black) as the evidence, which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated as P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness says black)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.236 = 0.506

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.506 or 50.6%.
