Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We know the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (from the city's population statistics)
- P(B|A) = 80% (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(B|A^c) = 20% (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was not black)
- P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 85% or 0.85 (from the city's population statistics)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
     ≈ 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.17)
     ≈ 0.24 / 0.41
     ≈ 0.58535

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.58535 or 58.54%.
