To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is not black, and the witness made an error in identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is P(black) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is P(white) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood ratio is:

LR = P(witness identifies black | attacker is black) / P(witness identifies black | attacker is white)

= (P(black) * 0.8) / (P(white) * 0.2)

Given that 85% of the population is white, we can write the equation for the likelihood ratio as:

LR = (P(black) * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.2)

LR = 12 * P(black) / 0.3

However, the likelihood ratio is given in the witness's statement, and we can use it to find the probability of the attacker being black:

P(black) = LR * 0.3 / 12

P(black) = 0.05 * LR

Given the witness's statement that the attacker was identified as black with a likelihood ratio of 2, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.1}
