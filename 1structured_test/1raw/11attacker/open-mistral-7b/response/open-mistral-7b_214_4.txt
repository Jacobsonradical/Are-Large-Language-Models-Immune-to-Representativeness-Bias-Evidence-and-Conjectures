To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. Since the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's race, we assume that the attacker's race was incorrectly identified with a 20% probability. This means that there is a 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct and the attacker actually being black is the product of the prior probability and the probability of correct identification.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, since there was an error in the witness's identification, we also need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race as black and the attacker actually being white. This probability is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness's identification is more likely to be incorrect (17%) than correct (12%), it is more likely that the attacker is white, even though the city's population is mostly white.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is less than the actual population proportion of black people in the city, but still higher than the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification.

Both estimates are:
{probability: 0.12, probability: 0.17}
