Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's race, we can calculate P(B|A) (the probability of B given A) as the product of the witness's correct identification rate and the proportion of black people in the city:

P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

On the other hand, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the probability of B given not-A (the attacker is white) is the product of the error rate and the proportion of white people in the city:

P(B|not-A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.12 * 0.15 / [0.12 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

After calculating, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.33.
