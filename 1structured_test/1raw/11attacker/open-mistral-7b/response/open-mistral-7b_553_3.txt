To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, and the city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the event "Attacker is black" as A, and the event "Witness incorrectly identifies attacker's race" as E. We want to find the probability of A, P(A).

We know that P(A) = P(A ∩ ¬E) + P(A ∩ E), where ¬E denotes the event "Witness correctly identifies attacker's race."

From the given information, we can calculate P(A ∩ ¬E) and P(A ∩ E) as follows:

P(A ∩ ¬E) = Probability of attacker being black and witness correctly identifying the attacker's race.
P(A ∩ ¬E) = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person
P(A ∩ ¬E) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

P(A ∩ E) = Probability of attacker being black and witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race.
P(A ∩ E) = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person
P(A ∩ E) = 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03

So, P(A) = P(A ∩ ¬E) + P(A ∩ E) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%.
