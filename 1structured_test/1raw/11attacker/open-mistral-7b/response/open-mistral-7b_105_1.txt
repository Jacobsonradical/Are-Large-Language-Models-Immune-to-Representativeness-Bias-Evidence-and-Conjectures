Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down the variables:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

First, we need to find the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (from information "a"). So, P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the person is black. This information is given as 80% in information "b". So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the person is white, is given as 20% in information "b". So, P(~E|~H) = 0.2. Since P(E|~H) = 1 - P(~E|~H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, and we're interested in P(~E|H), we can use the Bayes' theorem formula again: P(~E|H) = [P(H|~E) * P(~H)] / [P(~E)]. We know P(~H) = 0.85 (from information "a"), so P(H|~E) = 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.1765. So, P(~E|H) = 0.1765.

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the person is not black. This is the probability of a false positive, which we know is 20% in information "b". So, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Since P(~E|H) and P(E|~H) are the same, we can simply use the value we calculated earlier: P(E|~H) = P(~E|H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [P(E)]

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H). Substituting the values, we get:

P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4831

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
