To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that, in a fair scenario, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time.

However, we don't have enough information to know if the witness made an error in this case or not. The witness could have correctly identified the attacker as black, or they could have made an error and misidentified a white person as black.

The demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness made an error in this case, then the attacker is likely to be white. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be the probability of the witness making an error, which is 20%.

But if we assume that the witness correctly identified the attacker, then the attacker is likely to be black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

Since we don't have enough information to know whether the witness made an error or not, we cannot provide a definitive probability. However, if we have to make an educated guess, we would lean towards the demographic probability, which is 15%.
