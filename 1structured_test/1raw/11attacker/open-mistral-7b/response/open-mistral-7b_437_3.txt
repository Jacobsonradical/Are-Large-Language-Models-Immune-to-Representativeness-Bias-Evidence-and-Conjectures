Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula used in probability theory. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and our evidence is the witness's statement and the racial distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence (the witness's statement and the city's racial distribution)

From the information given, we have two pieces of evidence:
1) The witness's statement that the attacker is black.
2) The racial distribution in the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Now, we need to calculate the probabilities of these events:

P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the probability of this event before considering any evidence. Given that we don't have any prior information, we can assume that P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).

P(E|H): the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black. Since the witness identified the attacker as black 80% of the times when the person was indeed black, we can assume P(E|H) = 0.8.

P(H|E): the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. This is what we want to find.

P(E|~H): the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race 20% of the times when the person was indeed white, we can assume P(E|~H) = 0.2.

P(~H): the probability of the attacker not being black, which is the probability of this event before considering any evidence. Given that we don't have any prior information, we can assume that P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.245

So, based on the witness's statement and the racial distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24.5%.
