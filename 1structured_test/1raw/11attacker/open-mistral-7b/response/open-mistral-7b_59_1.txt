To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(Event | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Event) * P(Event)] / [P(Evidence)]

Here, we have:

- Event: The attacker is black
- Evidence: The witness's testimony that the attacker is black

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(Event): Unknown probability of the attacker being black. We want to find this probability.
- P(Evidence | Event): The probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80%).
- P(Evidence | not Event): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).
- P(Event): This is what we want to find.
- P(Evidence): The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is black, given that the attacker could be either black or white. This can be calculated as the sum of P(Evidence | Event) and P(Evidence | not Event) times the respective probabilities of the events:

P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | Event) * P(Event) + P(Evidence | not Event) * P(not Event)

We are given P(not Event) = 1 - P(Event), so we can rewrite this as:

P(Evidence) = 0.8 * P(Event) + 0.2 * (1 - P(Event))

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) P(Event) = probability of attacker being black
2) P(Evidence) = 0.8 * P(Event) + 0.2 * (1 - P(Event))

We can solve this system of equations to find P(Event).

However, we are also given the population statistics: 85% white and 15% black. This information can be used to provide a prior estimate for P(Event).

Using this prior estimate, we can calculate P(Evidence) and compare it with the actual observed value of P(Evidence) to update our belief about P(Event).

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact values for P(Event) or the observed value of P(Evidence), I cannot provide a numerical estimate for P(Event). You would need to calculate these values using the given information and the Bayes' theorem formula.
