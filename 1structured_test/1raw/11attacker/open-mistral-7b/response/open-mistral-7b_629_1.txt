Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

Given the information, we can compute the probabilities as follows:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   P(E|not H) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying black people)
   P(not H) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being white in the city)
   P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.482

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.482 or 48.2%.
