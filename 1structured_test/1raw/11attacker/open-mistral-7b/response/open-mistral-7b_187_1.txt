Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying race and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Identification)]

Since the witness's identification is not reliable (has an error rate of 20%), we need to adjust the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's identification.

1. P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals)
2. P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying black individuals)
3. P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
4. P(Attacker is White) = 0.85 (from the population statistics)

Now let's calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)
P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification):

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Identification)]
P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.482

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.482 (or 48.2%). This suggests that, despite the witness's identification, it is still more likely that the attacker is white based on the city's population statistics. However, the witness's identification cannot be completely dismissed due to their accuracy rate in identifying race.
