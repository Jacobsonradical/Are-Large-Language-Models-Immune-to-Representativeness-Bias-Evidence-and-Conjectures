Given the information provided, the population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness, who is not infallible, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black should be weighed against the population statistics, taking into account the witness's error rate. Let's call the true probability of the attacker being black P.

The witness correctly identifying the attacker as black can be modeled as a binomial distribution with n trials (the number of times the witness saw a person of that race), p being the probability of the attacker being black (which we are trying to find), and q being the probability of the attacker being white (1 - p).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black is P * (0.8) + (1 - P) * (0), where 0.8 is the witness's success rate when the attacker is black.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is P * (0.2) + (1 - P) * (1), where 0.2 is the witness's error rate when the attacker is white.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement can be calculated as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black divided by the total probability of the witness making such a statement:

P = [P * (0.8) + (1 - P) * (0)] / [P * (0.8) + (1 - P) * (0.2) + P * (0.2) + (1 - P) * (1)]

Solving this equation gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black:
