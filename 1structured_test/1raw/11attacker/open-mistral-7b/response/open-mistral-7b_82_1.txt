Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the witness's description of the attacker as black was made in the dark, we cannot directly apply the population composition.

Instead, we should consider the witness's error rate and the likelihood of the witness making an error in identifying the attacker as white. If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white and the witness misidentifying them as black is:

0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.20 (probability of witness error) = 0.17 (probability of both events happening)

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when the attacker was actually black, the probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying them is:

0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.80 (probability of witness correct identification) = 0.12 (probability of both events happening)

Because the witness's description of the attacker as black is more probable than the witness making an error, we can conclude that the attacker is more likely to be black. However, the error rate is not insignificant, and it is important to note that this estimate is based on imperfect information.

Strictly in the format you requested, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
