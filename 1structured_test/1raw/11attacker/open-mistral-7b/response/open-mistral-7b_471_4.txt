The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote W as the event of the witness correctly identifying a black person, and E as the event of the attacker being black. We want to find P(E|W).

From the information given, we have P(W|E) = 0.8 and P(W|~E) = 0.2 (where ~E means the attacker is not black).

Since the witness's error rate is constant, P(~W|E) = 0.2 and P(~W|~E) = 0.8.

The Bayes' theorem formula is P(E|W) = [P(W|E) * P(E)] / [P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|~E) * P(~E)].

Substituting the probabilities, we get: P(E|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85].

This simplifies to: P(E|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12%.
