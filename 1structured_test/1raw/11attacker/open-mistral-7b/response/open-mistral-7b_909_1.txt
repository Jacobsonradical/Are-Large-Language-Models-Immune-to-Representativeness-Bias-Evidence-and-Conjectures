Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker's race being correct or incorrect in this specific case, we can use the error rate as an estimate for the probability of the attacker being white, as the witness erring would imply that the attacker is white.

The error rate is 20%, so the probability of the attacker being white is 0.20. Subtracting this from 1 gives us the probability of the attacker being black:

{probability: 0.80}
