To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, they misidentified the attacker as black, which means they erred in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's statement, is the error rate:

Probability(attacker is white | witness statement) = Error rate
                                                                         = 0.2

Now, to find the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Probability(attacker is black | witness statement) = Probability(witness statement | attacker is black) * Probability(attacker is black) / Probability(witness statement)

Given that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, and 15% of the city's population is black:

Probability(witness statement | attacker is black) = 0.8

We can now calculate the probability of the witness statement:

Probability(witness statement) = Probability(witness statement | attacker is black) * Probability(attacker is black) + Probability(witness statement | attacker is white) * Probability(attacker is white)
                                                   = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
                                                   = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                   = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement:

Probability(attacker is black | witness statement) = Probability(witness statement | attacker is black) * Probability(attacker is black) / Probability(witness statement)
                                                                         = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
                                                                         â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
