To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

If we assume that the witness is just as likely to err in identifying a black person as a white person (which is a reasonable assumption given that they have the same error rate for both), then the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black when they are actually black is 0.8 (their correct identification rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, which is 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the racial demographics of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it's more likely that the attacker is white.

If we assume that the attacker is equally likely to be any person in the city, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's identification changes this. Since the witness is more likely to correctly identify a black person as black than to incorrectly identify a black person as white, and since they identified the attacker as black, it's more likely that the attacker is actually black than it would be if we just looked at the racial demographics of the city.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is higher than 0.15, but it's not as high as the witness's 0.8 rate of correct identification.

To find a probability that takes both factors into account, we could weight the two probabilities based on their reliability. If we assume that the witness's identification is twice as reliable as the racial demographics of the city (which seems reasonable given that the witness saw the attacker and the racial demographics are just statistics), then we can set the weighted probability equal to the witness's 0.8 rate of correct identification:

0.8 = 0.15 * probability_black + 0.85 * (1 - probability_black)

Solving for probability_black, we get:

probability_black = 0.8 / (0.85 + 0.15) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%). This means that, given the evidence, it's more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and that there is always uncertainty in such situations.
