Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black (since the witness said so).

Scenario 2: The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker could be white or black, but since 85% of the population is white, it's more likely that the witness erroneously identified a white person as black.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for these scenarios:

Scenario 1: The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%). Since the attacker is indeed black if the witness is correct, this probability remains 0.8.

Scenario 2: The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (20%). When the witness makes an error, the actual attacker could be either white or black. Since 85% of the population is white, it's more likely that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. So, the actual probability of the attacker being black in this scenario is 0.15 (15%), the population proportion of blacks.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability that the attacker is black by weighting the probabilities of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 with their respective probabilities:

Estimated probability of the attacker being black = (Probability of Scenario 1) * (Probability of attacker being black in Scenario 1) + (Probability of Scenario 2) * (Probability of attacker being black in Scenario 2)

Estimated probability of the attacker being black = (0.8) * (0.8) + (0.2) * (0.15)

Estimated probability of the attacker being black = 0.64 + 0.03 = 0.67

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.67 or 67%.
