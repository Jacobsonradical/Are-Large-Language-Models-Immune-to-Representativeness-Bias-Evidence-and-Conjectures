Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness was correct in this case.

Assuming the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying a black person as white and an incorrectly identifying a white person as black, the witness's identification of the attacker as black has a 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% chance of being correct if the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, the witness's identification has a 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68% chance of being correct if the attacker is actually black.

Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identifies him as black:

{probability: 0.68}
