To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black (before considering the evidence)

From the information provided, we have:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
2. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was not black)
3. P(H) = probability of an attacker being black in the population
4. P(~H) = 1 - P(H)

The goal is to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence. According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate P(H) as follows:

P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.196

The probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 19.6%.
