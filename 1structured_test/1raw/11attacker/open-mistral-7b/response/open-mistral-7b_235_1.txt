Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using the Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is given by the product of the probability of event B given event A (also known as the likelihood) and the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the likelihood of event A given all possible events (the normalizing constant).

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is given as 80% (0.8).

The prior probability of the attacker being white is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is assumed to be 0 (since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black less than 100% of the time, and we have no information to the contrary).

The normalizing constant is the sum of the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black and the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.75 or 75%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case in real life. Additionally, the estimate is based on a single piece of evidence (the witness's identification), and other evidence could potentially change the probability estimate.
