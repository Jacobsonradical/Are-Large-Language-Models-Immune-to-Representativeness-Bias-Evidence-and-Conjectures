Based on the information provided, there are two sources of information about the attacker's race: the demographics of the city and the witness's identification.

1. Demographics: According to the demographics, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

2. Witness's identification: The witness, who has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying race and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider both sources of information. The witness's identification is not definitive evidence because of the error rate. However, it is still a piece of evidence that we should take into account.

The demographic information suggests that the attacker is likely to be white, given that the majority of the city's population is white. But we should also consider the witness's identification, which suggests that the attacker might be black.

Given that the witness's identification is not definitive but still indicates that the attacker might be black, we can combine this information with the demographic information using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the probability of A occurring in the absence of evidence, P(B) is the probability of B occurring, and P(B|A) is the probability of B given that A is true.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We know P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of an attacker being black according to the demographics), P(B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate in identifying black attackers).

Given these values, P(A|B) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.8 = 0.15, or 15%.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a white attacker as black. The probability of this happening is P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying white attackers as black).

The probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) / P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.8 = 0.17, or 17%.

Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black, taking into account both sources of information, is 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, or 32%.

In summary, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32, or 32%.
