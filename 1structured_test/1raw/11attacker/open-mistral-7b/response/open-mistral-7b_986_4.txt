To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (erring in race identification). Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this case, we should consider both possibilities:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this happening is the witness's correct identification rate, which is 0.8.
2. The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the actual error that occurred. Therefore, we should consider the racial composition of the city to make an informed guess.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, it's more likely that the attacker is white even if the witness made an error. Therefore, we should assign a higher probability to the scenario where the attacker is white and the witness made an error.

The probability of the attacker being black can be estimated as the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios, weighted by their likelihood given the city's racial composition.

probability = (probability of correct identification * probability of attacker being black given correct identification) + (probability of error * probability of attacker being black given error)

probability = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

probability = 0.12 + 0.17

probability = 0.29

Therefore, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.29, or 29%. However, this estimate is somewhat unreliable due to the uncertainty about the witness's error in this case.
