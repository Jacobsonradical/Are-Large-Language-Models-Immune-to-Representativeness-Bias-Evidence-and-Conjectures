Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately judge a person's race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as we do not know if the witness's identification was correct or an error.

To estimate the probability, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness made a correct identification and the possibility that they made an error.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person and a 20% chance of making an error, we can calculate the probability that the witness's identification was correct as:

P(correct identification) = P(black) * 0.8

On the other hand, the witness could have made an error and identified the attacker as black despite the attacker being white. The probability of this happening is:

P(error) = P(white) * 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write the equation that describes the probability distribution as:

P(witness's identification) = P(correct identification) + P(error)

Substituting the values, we get:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = 1

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can write:

P(white) = 0.85

So, the equation becomes:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * 0.85 = 1

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.455

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 45.5%.
