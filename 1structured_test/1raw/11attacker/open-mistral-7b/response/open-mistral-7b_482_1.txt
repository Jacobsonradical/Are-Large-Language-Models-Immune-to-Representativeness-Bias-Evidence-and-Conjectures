Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (given that the attacker is not black)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (which is 1 - P(A))
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black (regardless of the attacker's race)

We are given the following values:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability)
- P(A) = ? (what we want to find)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.15 (from the racial composition of the city)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.12 * P(A) + 0.03

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.12 * P(A) + 0.03)

Solving for P(A) gives us:
P(A) = P(A|B) * (0.12 * P(A) + 0.03) / 0.8

Since we don't have a value for P(A|B), we can't provide a numerical estimate. However, we can say that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.15 (the racial composition of the city) but less than the witness's estimated probability of correctly identifying a black person (0.8). To find the exact probability, we would need more information, such as the value of P(A|B).
