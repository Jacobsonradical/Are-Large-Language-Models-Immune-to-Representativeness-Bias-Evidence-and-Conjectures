To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's ability to identify races and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- W: the probability that the witness misidentifies a white person as black
- B: the probability that the attacker is black

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, we can write the equation:
0.8B + 0.2(1-B) = 0.8

Solving for B, we get:
B = 0.75

However, the information about the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black) should also be considered. Since the witness's ability to identify races is not affected by the racial composition of the city, we can use the probability estimate from the first equation as our initial estimate.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification
- P(B): the actual probability that the attacker is black

We know that:
P(A) = (number of black attackers / total number of attackers)

Since we don't have the total number of attacks, we can't directly calculate P(A). But we can calculate it in terms of P(B):

P(A) = (P(B) * number of black people in the city) / (P(B) * number of black people in the city + (1-P(B)) * number of white people in the city)

Substituting our initial estimate of B (0.75) and the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black), we get:

P(A) = (0.75 * 0.15) / (0.75 * 0.15 + (1-0.75) * 0.85)

Calculating P(A) gives us a probability estimate of approximately 0.16 or 16%. This estimate is significantly lower than our initial estimate of 75%.

The reason for this discrepancy is that our initial estimate was based on the witness's ability to identify races, but it did not take into account the racial composition of the city. In a city with a much higher percentage of white people, it is less likely that a black person would be mistaken for a white person, even if the witness's ability to identify races is the same.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 16%.
