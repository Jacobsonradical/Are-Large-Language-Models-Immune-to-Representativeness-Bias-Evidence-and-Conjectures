Given the information provided, we can't make a definitive estimate based solely on the racial identification of the attacker by the witness. However, we can use the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population as a rough approximation.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then given that the attacker was identified as black, there's a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed black.

However, we also know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. If the witness's identification is independent of the population distribution, then we would expect the witness to incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. But since 85% of the population is white, this means that in 17% of cases where the witness identifies someone as black, they are actually mistaking a white person for a black person.

So, if the witness identifies someone as black, the probability that they are actually correct is 0.8 (their correct rate), and the probability that they are mistaken is 0.17 (the rate at which they mistakenly identify whites as blacks). The total probability of the witness being correct (the attacker being black) or being mistaken (the attacker being white) is therefore 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case. In reality, the witness may be more likely to mistake a white person for a black person than the other way around. If this is the case, the actual probability that the attacker is black could be lower than 0.97.

Therefore, while we can provide an estimate based on the given information, it's important to note that this estimate is likely to be an overestimate, and the actual probability could be lower.
