Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, which is an error in this context. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's mistake, is the error rate:

{probability: 0.2, this is the 20% error rate}

However, we are asked for the probability that the attacker is black. Since we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake in the opposite direction (identifying a white person as black) and subtract that from 1:

1 - Probability of witness identifying white person as black = 1 - (0.85 * 0.2)
                                                                               = 1 - 0.17
                                                                               = 0.83

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's mistake, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:

{probability: 0.8, this is the 80% correct identification rate}

There seems to be a contradiction in the two answers I provided. The reason is that the witness's error rate and the population distribution are independent pieces of information. The witness's ability to judge race and the actual racial composition of the population do not affect each other. Therefore, we cannot combine them directly to get a single probability estimate. If we had more information, such as the attacker's height, weight, or clothing, we could potentially use that to narrow down the possibilities and estimate the probability more accurately. But with just the race information, we cannot make a definitive estimate.
