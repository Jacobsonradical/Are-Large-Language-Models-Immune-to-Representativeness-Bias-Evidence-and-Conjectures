Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not infallible in their ability to identify race, correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time when presented with half white and half black individuals.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution of the city and the reliability of the witness's identification.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.
2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.
3. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making such a mistake for the attacker (if the attacker is white) is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).
4. However, we know that the witness actually identified the attacker as black. So, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the complement of this error probability: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
