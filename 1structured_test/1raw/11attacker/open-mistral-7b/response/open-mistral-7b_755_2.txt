To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, we can assume that they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. This means that they incorrectly identify a black person as white only 8% of the time (since the city is 85% white and 15% black).

So, when the witness identifies a person as black, the probability that they are correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that they are wrong is 0.2 (20%).

However, we know that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the actual probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified him as black, is the probability of the witness being wrong when she says black:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = P(witness is wrong) = 0.2

But we also know that the city is 85% white and 15% black. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker being black, without considering the witness's identification, is:

P(attacker is black) = 0.15

Now, we want to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification. By Bayes' theorem, this is:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness says black)

Since we know that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white only 8% of the time, and since she incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the likelihood of her being wrong when she says black is:

P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8

The probability of the witness saying black is the sum of the probability of her being right and the probability of her being wrong. Since she is wrong 20% of the time, and since she is right 80% of the time, the probability of her saying black is:

P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)
P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (since the city is 85% white)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(witness says black) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41. This means that, given the witness's identification and considering the reliability of the witness and the racial demographics of the city, we estimate that there is a 41% chance that the attacker is black.
