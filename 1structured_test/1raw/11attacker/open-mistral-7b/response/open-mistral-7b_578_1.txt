Given the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The accuracy of the witness's race judgments under similar conditions is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of an attacker being black, based on the city's population)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, given that the attacker is black)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black)
4. P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of an attacker being white, based on the city's population)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the value:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, given the information and the witness's racial identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.24 or 24%.
