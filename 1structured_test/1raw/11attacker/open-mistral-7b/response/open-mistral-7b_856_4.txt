Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2 * 0.5 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time and there is a 50% chance that the attacker is white) = 0.1
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and their accuracy in identifying race, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
