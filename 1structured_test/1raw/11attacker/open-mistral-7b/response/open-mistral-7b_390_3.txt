To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is not black given that the witness identified someone as black

We are given the following information:
1. P(B) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)

Now we need to find P(B|W).

According to the Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

First, we need to find P(W). P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can happen either if the person is black (P(W|B)) or if the person is not black but the witness erroneously identifies them as black (P(W|~B)). So, P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.204

Now we can find P(B|W): P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.204 â‰ˆ 0.68

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This means that, given the information, there is approximately a 68% chance that the attacker is black.
