Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is estimated as follows:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately judge race is only 80% accurate. This means that when they see a person, they correctly identify their race 80% of the time and mistakenly identify it 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have any information about the attacker being white or black being more common in the specific area where the attack took place. Therefore, we should consider both possibilities equally likely.
4. If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. This means that out of the 20% of the time the witness errs, 12.5% of those errors would be incorrectly identifying a white person as black (since there are twice as many white people as black people).
5. So, the probability that the witness's mistake was incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.125 = 0.025 or 2.5%.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of a mistake being an incorrect identification of a white person as black: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.025 = 0.12 + 0.0025 = 0.1225 or 12.25%.

However, this estimate is likely too low because it assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for all races. In reality, the witness's error rate for identifying black people as white would likely be lower than their error rate for identifying white people as black. Therefore, the actual probability that the attacker is black is likely higher than 12.25%. To calculate an accurate probability, more information about the witness's error rates for each race would be needed.

{probability: 0.1225, please note that this is an estimate that assumes the witness's error rate is the same for all races, and a more accurate estimate would require additional information.}
