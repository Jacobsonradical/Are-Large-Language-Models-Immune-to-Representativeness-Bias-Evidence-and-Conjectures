Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- B is the evidence (witness identified attacker as black)
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the identification

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time, where ~A represents attacker is not black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on the given conditions and assumptions, and other factors could influence the actual probability.
