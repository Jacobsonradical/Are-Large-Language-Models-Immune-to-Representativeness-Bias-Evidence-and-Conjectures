To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as black, then the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black given an error by the witness is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness did not make an error and correctly identified the attacker as black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black given a correct identification by the witness is 1, as the witness's identification is assumed to be accurate in this scenario.

Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we need to weigh the probabilities of both scenarios. The probability of making an error is the erroneous identification rate of 0.2 (20%), and the probability of not making an error is the correct identification rate of 0.8 (80%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the weighted sum of the probabilities in both scenarios:

{probability: 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 1 = 0.18}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.18 or 18%. This estimate takes into account the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.
