Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The prior probability of A, P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).
2. The conditional probability of B given A, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).
3. The conditional probability of B given not A, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time).

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the total population proportion:
P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
   = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of A given B:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
   â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.34 (or 34%).
