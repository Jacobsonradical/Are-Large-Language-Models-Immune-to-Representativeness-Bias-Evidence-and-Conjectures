Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80% under similar conditions, and they are mistaken 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. This could be a correct identification (80% chance), or an error (20% chance).
4. Since we don't know whether the witness was correct or not, we cannot simply use the city's population statistics. Instead, we need to consider both the possibility of a correct identification and an error.
5. If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed black (with a probability of 0.85, since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
6. If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is actually white (with a probability of 0.15, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).
7. However, we don't have enough information to distinguish between these two scenarios. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities equally likely.
8. The overall probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68 + 0.02 = 0.7.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.7 (70%).
