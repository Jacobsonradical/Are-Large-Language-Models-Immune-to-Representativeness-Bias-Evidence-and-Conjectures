Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker being black),
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifying a black person as black 80% of the time),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness identifying someone as black), and
- P(H|E) is the updated probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

First, let's calculate P(E|H). Since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(E). Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that the witness would identify someone as black is the proportion of blacks in the city. So, P(E) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(H). This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.15
P(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This is a significantly lower probability than the actual population proportion of black people in the city, suggesting that the witness's identification may not be reliable. However, without more information, this is the best estimate we can make based on the given information.
