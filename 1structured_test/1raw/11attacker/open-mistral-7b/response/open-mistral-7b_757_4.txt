To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy rate in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without knowing the hypothesis)

First, let's find P(E | H). The witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. So, P(E | H) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying a black person).

Next, we need to find P(H). According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population in the city is black. So, P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black).

Now, we need to find P(E). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people, we can estimate that P(E) is closer to 0.8 than 0.5. We can use the witness's accuracy rate and the population proportions to estimate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
P(E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) ≈ 0.12 + 0.17
P(E) ≈ 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
P(H | E) ≈ 0.241

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.241 or 24.1%.
