Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not necessarily accurate in identifying race reported that the attacker was black. The witness was correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any other information that would suggest the witness was more likely to be correct or incorrect in this specific case, we can consider the witness's statements as independent events. In other words, the fact that the witness was correct in 80% of their previous identifications does not necessarily mean they are more likely to be correct in this case.

Given this, the probability that the attacker is black is a balance between the general population statistics and the witness's accuracy. The witness's accuracy of 80% can be thought of as a "correction factor" to the overall population statistics.

So, the probability that the attacker is black could be estimated as the product of the population percentage of black people and the witness's accuracy in identifying black people.

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%}

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate. In a real-world scenario, more information or different considerations might lead to a different conclusion. Also, the assumption of independence between the witness's past identifications and this specific case might not always hold true.
