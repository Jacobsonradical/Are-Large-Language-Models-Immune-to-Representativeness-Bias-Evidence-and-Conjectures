Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be:

{probability: 0.88}

Here's the reasoning behind this estimate:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is generally accurate in identifying race (80% correct, 20% incorrect), identified the attacker as black.
3. Since the witness's accuracy is higher for black individuals than for white individuals, it indicates a higher likelihood that the attacker is actually black, rather than the majority white population.
4. To account for the witness's influence, we can calculate the adjusted probability for the attacker being black by multiplying the city's black population proportion (15%) by the witness's accuracy for identifying black individuals (0.8).
5. This calculation gives us an adjusted probability of 0.12 * 0.8 = 0.096 or 9.6%.
6. However, since the witness's error rate is also higher for black individuals, there is a chance that the witness may have mistakenly identified a white individual as black.
7. To account for this possibility, we can also calculate an upper bound for the attacker being black by assuming that all of the witness's errors in identifying race occurred when identifying white individuals as black.
8. This would mean that the attacker is actually black and the witness's mistake was simply to misidentify them as white.
9. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be the proportion of black individuals in the city (15%) minus the proportion of white individuals the witness incorrectly identified as black (20% of 0.85 = 0.17).
10. So, the probability of the attacker being black in this scenario would be 0.15 - 0.17 = -0.02 or a negative value, which is an impossible probability.
11. Since we cannot have a negative probability, we can assume that the witness's error rate for identifying black individuals is not as high as we initially assumed.
12. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate for the attacker being black would be a combination of the city's black population proportion and the witness's accuracy for identifying black individuals.
13. This gives us an estimate of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%, which is close to the adjusted probability calculated earlier.
14. However, given the uncertainty in the witness's ability to judge a person's race under the nighttime conditions, it would be reasonable to consider a slightly higher estimate to account for this uncertainty.
15. Therefore, a more conservative estimate for the probability of the attacker being black would be 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.1275 or 12.75%, which falls within the range of reasonable estimates.
16. However, the most reliable estimate would be to conduct further investigation, such as gathering additional witness statements or evidence to confirm the attacker's race.

In summary, based on the given information, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is 0.88 or 88%. However, this estimate is subject to uncertainty and further investigation is necessary to confirm the attacker's race with greater accuracy.
