Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- ē: the witness's statement

From the witness's statement (ē), we know that the probability of it being true given that the attacker is black (P(ē|H)) is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of it being true given that the attacker is white (P(ē|~H)) is 0.2 (20%).

We also know the prior probabilities: P(H) is the probability of the attacker being black, and P(~H) is the probability of the attacker being white. From the population statistics, we know that P(H) = 0.15 (15%) and P(~H) = 0.85 (85%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability P(H|ē):

P(H|ē) = P(ē|H) * P(H) / [P(ē|H) * P(H) + P(ē|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|ē) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we find:

P(H|ē) ≈ 0.205

So, given the witness statement, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.
