Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability:
The witness saw the attacker and identified them as black. If the attacker was actually white, this would be an error. The probability of the witness making an error (mistaking a white person for black) is 20%.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. This is the inverse of the probability of the witness making this mistake, which is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83.
