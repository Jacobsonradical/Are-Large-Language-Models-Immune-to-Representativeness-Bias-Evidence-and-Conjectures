To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A divided by the prior probability of event B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given in the population statistics (b): P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker being black makes up 15% of the population).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is given in the witness's ability to judge race (a): P(B|A) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(B|not A)) is the complement of P(B|A) due to the witness's error rate: P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

The prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (P(B)) is the sum of the probability of this happening given the attacker is black and given the attacker is white: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is roughly 0.48 or 48%.
