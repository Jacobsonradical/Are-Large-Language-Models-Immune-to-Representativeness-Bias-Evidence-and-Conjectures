To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- Ω: The attacker's race is either black or white
- E: The witness's description matches a black person

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (given that the attacker is black) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error (given that the attacker is black) is 0.2.

We are given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This means that P(A) = 0.15 and P(Ω-A) = 0.85.

Now, we want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ω-A) * P(Ω-A)]

To calculate P(E|Ω-A), we need to find the probability of the witness making a false identification (given that the attacker is not black). Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when identifying black people, we can infer that they are correct 80% of the time when identifying white people.

So, P(E|Ω-A) = 0.8 (given that 85% of the population is white)

Now we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
