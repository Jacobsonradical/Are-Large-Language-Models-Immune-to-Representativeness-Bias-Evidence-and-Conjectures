Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have information about the racial composition of the group the witness was observing when making their identification.

Assuming the witness saw a random person from the city, we can use the population statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and considering the 85% white and 15% black population ratio, we can calculate an adjusted probability.

However, without knowing the specific context in which the witness made their identification, it's not possible to provide an exact probability. Therefore, I must conclude that I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format.
