Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any other information about the specific case, we can assume that the attacker's race was identified based on the witness's observations. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, according to the witness's testimony, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also have information about the racial composition of the city. If 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, this could potentially affect the likelihood of the attacker being black, independent of the witness's testimony. To incorporate this information, we would need additional data or assumptions. For example, if we assume that attacks are evenly distributed across races, then the attacker's race might be expected to follow the city's racial demographics. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be 0.15 (or 15%).

Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive probability that takes both the witness's testimony and the city's racial demographics into account. It would require a more sophisticated statistical model to integrate these two sources of information.
