Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observable evidence. In this case, the event is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
- A: attacker is black
- B: witness identified attacker as black
- P(A|B): probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given P(B|A) and P(A), so we can find P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
          = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.03]
          = 0.12 / 0.15
          = 0.8

So our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8, or 80%.
