To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black when he/she is actually white is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black when he/she is actually black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Since we don't have enough information about the frequency of attacks in the city, we can't consider the likelihood of an attack happening to a particular race. However, we can still calculate the ratio of the probabilities of the witness's erroneous identification and correct identification, which should ideally represent the racial demographics of the city.

The ratio of the probabilities is 0.17 / 0.12 = 1.417, which is closer to the actual ratio of white and black population in the city (85/15). This suggests that the witness's estimate of the attacker's race being black is biased towards the demographics of the city.

Based on this analysis, it seems plausible that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical analysis and not definitive evidence.

{probability: 0.15}

This estimate is based on the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race, assuming that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the city. Given the limitations of the information, this estimate should be considered an approximation rather than a conclusive finding.
