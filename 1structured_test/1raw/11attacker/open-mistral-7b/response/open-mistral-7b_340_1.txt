Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black based on the witness's error rate.

If the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black, the probability of this event would be equal to the error rate of 20%. Since 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

In summary, based on the witness's ability to identify race and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
