Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not always reliable in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the witness made a correct identification, and the probability that the attacker is white and the witness made a mistake.

The probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%), and the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (85%). The probability that the witness makes a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that the witness makes a mistake when the attacker is black is 0.2 (20%). The probability that the witness makes a mistake when the attacker is white is 1, because the witness always identifies a white person as white, even if they make a mistake.

The probability that the witness makes a correct identification when the attacker is black and white is 0.8 \* 0.15 + 1 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.71 = 0.83.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the probability that the witness made a correct identification divided by the probability that the witness made a correct identification or a mistake: 0.83 / (0.83 + 0.17) = 0.83 / 0.9 = 0.92 or 92%.

However, this probability is based on the assumption that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race correctly. If there is some reason to believe that this is not the case, then the probability may be different.
