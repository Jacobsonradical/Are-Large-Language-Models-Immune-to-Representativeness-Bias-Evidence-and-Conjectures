The information provided indicates that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is not necessarily representative of the population's racial distribution has identified the attacker as black. This witness is known to make incorrect race judgments 20% of the time.

Given this information, we cannot directly use the population statistics to estimate the attacker's race with certainty. We can only consider the witness's statement and their error rate. If the witness is correct this time, the attacker is black. If they are incorrect, the attacker is likely white.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and we have no other information, our best estimate would be that the attacker is black, with a probability of 0.8.
