Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The provided information gives us the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% white means 15% black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the person was not black)

Here, ~A represents the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).

We can assume that the witness is equally likely to observe a white or black person (since the population is approximately balanced), so P(A) = P(~A) = 0.5.

We also know that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.21 (the witness's overall accuracy in identifying race).

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.67 (or 67%). This means that, given the witness's identification, it's more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the provided information and assumptions, and actual probabilities could be different in real-world situations.
