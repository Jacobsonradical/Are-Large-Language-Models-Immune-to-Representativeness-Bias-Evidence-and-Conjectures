Based on the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The reliability of the witness's race identification is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any information about the witness seeing the attacker directly, we'll assume that the witness's identification is independent of the actual attacker's race. This means that if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify him as black, and if the attacker is black, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify him.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2.

So, the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect given that the attacker is white is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Similarly, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8.

So, the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since we don't have any other information, we can't rule out the possibility that the witness made an error. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the probabilities of the witness being incorrect but identifying the attacker as black:

0.12 (probability of witness being correct and attacker being black) + 0.17 (probability of witness being incorrect and attacker being white)

This sums to 0.3 (or 30%). However, since the witness's identification has an error rate of 20%, it seems more likely that the witness made an error and the actual attacker is white. Therefore, a more reasonable estimate might be the probability of the witness being incorrect and identifying the attacker as black, which is 0.17 (or 17%).
