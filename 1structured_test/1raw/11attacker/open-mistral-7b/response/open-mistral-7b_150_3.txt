To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- E: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given two probabilities:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
2. P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8.
3. P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, we can calculate this as 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
4. P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 1 - P(A) = 1 - x (where x is our estimate of P(A)).
5. P(E) is the probability of the witness making the identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of two events: the witness correctly identifying a black person and the witness incorrectly identifying a white person. So, P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to estimate P(A):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

If we rearrange the equation to make P(A) the unknown, we get:

P(A) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)

Now, we can plug in the given values:

P(A) = 0.8 * x / (0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x))

Since 85% of the population is white, we can approximate P(not A) as 0.85. Now we can solve for x:

x = P(A) / (P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

0.8 = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15)

0.8 = P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.03)

0.56 = P(A)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.56 or 56%.
