Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

The prior probability P(H) can be estimated from the population demographics as provided in point b: P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population).

The likelihood P(E|H) is given by the witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 0.8 (80% correct) in this case.

The denominator P(E) can be estimated as the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|not H) * P(not H), where P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 0.85 (85% white population), and P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

Given the witness's error rate of 0.2 (20% incorrect), we can estimate P(E|not H) as 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)|H*P(H) + P(E)|not H*P(not H)]
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
        â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
