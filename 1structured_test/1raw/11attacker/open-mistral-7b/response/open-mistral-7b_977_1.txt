Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's observation)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness would observe a black person, given that the attacker is black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the observation)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability of the witness's observation, which is independent of the attacker's race)

In this case, P(B|A) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time), P(A) is given as 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(B) is given as 0.93 (85% of the population is white, and the witness erred 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.93 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation, is approximately 12%.
