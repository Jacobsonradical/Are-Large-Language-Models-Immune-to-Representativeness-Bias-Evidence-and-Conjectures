Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the proportion of blacks in the population, which is 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is equal to the error rate, 0.2.

So, P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34.48%.
