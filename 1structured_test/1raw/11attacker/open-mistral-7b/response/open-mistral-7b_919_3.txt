The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, given in the question as 80% or 0.8
- P(W|not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black, given in the question as 20% or 0.2
- P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.12 / 0.28 = 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 42.86%.
