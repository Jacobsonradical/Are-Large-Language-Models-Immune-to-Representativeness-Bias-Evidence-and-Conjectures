Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The attacker's race was reported as black by the witness. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so we should consider the possibility of a false report.

If the attacker was actually white, the witness would have erroneously reported them as black 20% of the time. Since the witness reported the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the attacker might be white, given the witness's error rate.

On the other hand, if the attacker is indeed black, the witness would correctly identify the race 80% of the time.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report and the racial composition of the city, can be calculated as follows:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker * Proportion of black people in the city
                                                      = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                      = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
