Given the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider: the overall racial distribution of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The overall racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, we need to adjust the witness's accuracy for this specific case, as the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's race directly. In such conditions, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's ability to accurately identify the attacker's race would be lower than their usual 80% accuracy.

Let's say we estimate that under these conditions, the witness's accuracy in identifying the attacker's race is reduced to 50% (which is less than half, but still slightly better than guessing at random).

Therefore, if the witness identified the attacker as black, this could be due to either:
- The attacker being black (which happens with a probability of 15% in the city's population)
- The witness making a correct identification (which happens with a probability of 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4 or 40% in this case)

So, the total probability that the attacker is black or that the witness made a correct identification is 15% + 0.4 * (1 - 15%) = 15% + 0.4 * 0.85 = 15% + 0.34 = 18.4%.

However, since the witness's estimated accuracy under these conditions is only 50%, it's more likely that the witness made an error in this specific case. In that case, the attacker would be white (which happens with a probability of 85% in the city's population).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is actually lower than the city's overall racial distribution of 15%. This is because the witness's identification is more likely to be an error, given their reduced accuracy in these conditions.

In conclusion, it's difficult to provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, due to the uncertainty surrounding the witness's accuracy in these specific conditions. However, it's clear that the probability is less than 15% and likely closer to the city's overall racial distribution of white people.
