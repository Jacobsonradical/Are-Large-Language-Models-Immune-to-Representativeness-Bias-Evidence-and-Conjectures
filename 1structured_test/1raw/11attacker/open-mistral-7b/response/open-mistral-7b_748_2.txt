To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means the attacker could be white with a probability of 1 - the probability that the attacker is black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, we must account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there's a chance that the attacker is actually white but the witness made an error. The probability of this error is the witness's error rate, which is 0.20.

So, the corrected probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's error, is the probability of the attacker being black without the error (0.15) multiplied by the probability of the witness not making an error (1 - 0.20):

0.15 * (1 - 0.20) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, taking into account the witness's error rate, is 0.12 or 12%.
