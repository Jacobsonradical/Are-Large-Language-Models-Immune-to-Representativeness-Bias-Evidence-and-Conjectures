To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (we don't have this information, but we'll estimate it later)
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) is the likelihood of the witness making this identification, given that the attacker is black (given in the information)
- P(B|~W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (we can estimate this from the information)
- P(~W|B) is the likelihood of the witness making an incorrect identification, given that the attacker is black (given in the information)
- P(~B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black (we can calculate this from the population data)

We know that P(W|B) = 0.8 (80%), P(~W|B) = 0.2 (20%), and P(~B) = 0.85 (from the city population data).

However, we don't have a direct way to calculate P(B|W). Instead, we can calculate the ratio P(B|W) / P(~B|W), which is the likelihood ratio, and then multiply it by the prior probability P(B) to get our final estimate.

P(B|W) / P(~B|W) = P(W|B) / P(W|~B) = 0.8 / 0.15 = 5.33

So, our final estimate for P(B) is:

P(B) = [P(B|W) / P(~B|W)] * P(~B) = 5.33 * 0.15 = 0.80

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%. This means that, given the evidence and our assumptions, we believe there is an 80% chance that the attacker is black.
