To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's report.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here's what each term means:

- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E). We want to find this probability.
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. This is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black, which is 0.8 (or 80%).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence regardless of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the witness making the same report (identifying the attacker as black) if the attacker is actually white.

To calculate P(E), we can use the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a white person as black, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (or 20%). Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 2 * 0.85 = 0.7 (or 70%). Therefore, the probability of the witness making the same report if the attacker is actually white is 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14 (or 14%).

Now we can plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.85 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8]

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.12 (or 12%)

So, based on the witness's report and the demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
