To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given that the witness's ability to identify race is not perfect, we need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error. Let's denote:

- P(attacker is black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(attacker is white) as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) = 1

According to the witness's statement, the probability of the witness saying "black" when the attacker is actually black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness saying "black" when the attacker is white is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time). So, we can write a system of two equations:

1) P(witness says "black") = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.2 * P(attacker is white)
2) P(population is black) = 0.15

Now we can solve this system of equations.

Let x = P(attacker is black) and y = P(attacker is white)

1) 0.8x + 0.2y = 0.8 (from the witness's statement)
2) x + y = 1 (from the fact that the probabilities sum to 1)

Substitute the equation from 2) into the equation from 1):

1') 0.8x + 0.2(1-x) = 0.8

Solve for x:

0.8x + 0.2 - 0.2x = 0.8
0.6x = 0.6
x = 1

However, x cannot be greater than 1, so this indicates that there might be an issue with the witness's statements or the reliability of the witness's observations. Given the information provided, it is not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black.
