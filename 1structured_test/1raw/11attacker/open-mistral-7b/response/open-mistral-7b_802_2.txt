To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's description).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E is the evidence, which is the witness's description
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the witness's description)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness's description given that the attacker is black
- P(E) is the probability of the witness's description occurring regardless of the attacker's race

We are given the following information:

1) P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
2) P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%)
3) P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H means not black)
   Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time when the person is black, P(E|~H) = 0.2
   Also, P(~H) = 0.85 (since P(H) + P(~H) = 1)

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18
         â‰ˆ 0.555

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.555 or 55.5%.
