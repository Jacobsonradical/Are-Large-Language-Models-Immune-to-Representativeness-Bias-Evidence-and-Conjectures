To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification and city demographics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down the terms:

1. P(H|E): This is what we want to find, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and city demographics.

2. P(E|H): This is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the evidence (witness's identification) given the hypothesis (attacker is black) is 0.8.

3. P(H): This is the prior probability of the hypothesis. Since we don't have any information about the attacker's race before the incident, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (from the provided data).

4. P(E): This is the probability of the evidence. The probability of the witness making the identification (regardless of the attacker's race) is 0.8 (from the provided data).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
          = 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%.
