Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not directly applicable to the attacker's race because the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. However, we do have the population statistics for the city, which is 85% white and 15% black.

Without any additional information, such as whether the witness's error rate is bias towards under-estimating or over-estimating the presence of black people, we can only use the population statistics to make an estimate.

Given that, the probability that the attacker is black would be 15%, as per the city's demographics.
