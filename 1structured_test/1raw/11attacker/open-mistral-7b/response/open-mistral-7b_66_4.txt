To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, and our prior belief is the racial distribution of the population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we can infer from the population distribution in the city)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (which is 1 - P(B))

From the information given, we know:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (80% accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% accuracy in identifying non-black people)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.215

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 21.5%.
