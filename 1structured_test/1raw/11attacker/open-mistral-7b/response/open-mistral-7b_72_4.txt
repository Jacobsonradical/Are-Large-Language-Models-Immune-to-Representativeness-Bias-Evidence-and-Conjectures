Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (this is what we are trying to find)

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(E): P(E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(H|E)

Since we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black, we'll use P(H|E) in our estimate.

{probability: 0.56, this is the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification}
