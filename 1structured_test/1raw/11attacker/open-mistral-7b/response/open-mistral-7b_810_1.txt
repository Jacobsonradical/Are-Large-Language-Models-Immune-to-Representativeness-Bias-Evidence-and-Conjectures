Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the data, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as black.
3. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race and found that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to account for both the racial composition of the city and the witness's error rate. Since we cannot know for sure if the witness made an error in this case (as the victim could not see the attacker's race), we should consider both possibilities:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race. In this case, the probability is simply the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.
2. The attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified the race. Given the witness's error rate, the probability of this happening is 20%.

Now, we need to combine these two probabilities to account for both possibilities:

1. Probability of the attacker being black and correctly identified: 0.15 (15%)
2. Probability of the attacker being white and mistakenly identified: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%)

The total probability of the attacker being black, considering both possibilities, is the sum of the probabilities above:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, answer: 0.32}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32 or 32%.
