To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider two scenarios:

1. The witness is correct: Given that the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black.

2. The witness is incorrect: Given that the witness identifies the race incorrectly 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness is mistakenly identifying the attacker as black.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly use the witness's identification. Instead, we need to adjust the witness's identification based on the city's racial demographics.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, if the attacker is indeed white, there is a 85% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as black. Conversely, if the attacker is black, there is a 15% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as white.

To maintain consistency with the witness's ability to identify races, we can assume that the attacker is more likely to be white if the witness identifies the attacker as black, and the attacker is more likely to be black if the witness does not identify the attacker's race.

Given the city's racial demographics, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (the probability of a black attacker given a misidentification) + 0.8 * 20% (the probability of a white attacker given a misidentification) = 15% + 0.16 * 20% = 15.2%.

So, based on the city's racial demographics and the witness's ability to identify races, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.2%.
