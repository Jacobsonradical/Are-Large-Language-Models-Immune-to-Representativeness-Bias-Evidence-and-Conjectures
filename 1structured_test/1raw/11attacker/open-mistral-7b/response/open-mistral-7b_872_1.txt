The probability of the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows you to calculate the probability of an event A given that you know the probability of another event B and the probability of A and B occurring together. In this case, A is the event "attacker is black," B is the event "witness says attacker is black," and the probability of A and B occurring together is given by the witness's accuracy rate.

The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
1. P(A|B) = the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness says the attacker is black. This is the probability we want to find.
2. P(B|A) = the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (the witness gets it right 80% of the time).
3. P(A) = the probability of the attacker being black. This is what we want to find.
4. P(B|not A) = the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 (the witness gets it wrong 20% of the time).
5. P(not A) = the probability of the attacker not being black. This is 1 - P(A).

First, we need to find P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(B|not A), so we can set up an equation to find P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are also given that 85% of the population in the city is white (P(not A)), so we can find P(A) = 1 - P(not A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
