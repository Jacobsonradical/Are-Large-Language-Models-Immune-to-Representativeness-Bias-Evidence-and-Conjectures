To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Considering these factors, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white:

Probability of witness error = 20% (error rate)

Since the witness is more likely to misidentify a white person as black instead of the other way around due to the city's racial composition, we can assume that the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is lower than 20%. Let's call this probability "p".

The total probability of misidentification is the sum of the witness's error rate and the probability of making an additional error by misidentifying a white person as black:

Total probability of misidentification = 20% + p

The probability of correctly identifying a black person is the complement of the total probability of misidentification:

Probability of correct identification = 1 - Total probability of misidentification

Given that the witness correctly identified a black person, we can write an inequality using the probability of correct identification and the city's racial composition:

Probability of correct identification ≥ 15% (probability of attacker being black)

1 - (20% + p) ≥ 15%

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) 80% = 1 - p
2) 1 - (20% + p) ≥ 15%

By solving these equations, we obtain p = 6%.

Substituting p = 6% into the first equation, we get:

80% = 1 - 6%

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black with the witness's corrected error rate:

1 - (20% + 6%) = 1 - 26% = 74% - 26% = 48%

However, since the witness's error rate is given as 20%, we must adjust our calculation to account for the original error rate. To do this, multiply the probability of correct identification by the witness's error rate:

Probability of correct identification * Error rate = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

Now, we can calculate the adjusted probability that the attacker is black:

1 - (0.2 + 0.16) = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64

So, based on the witness's reliability and the city's racial composition, the adjusted probability that the attacker is black is approximately 64%.

Answer: {probability: 0.64}
