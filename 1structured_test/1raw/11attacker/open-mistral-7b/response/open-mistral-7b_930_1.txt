Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = (P(E | H) * P(H)) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifying a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, regardless of whether the attacker is black or not)

We are given P(E | H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), and P(E) can be calculated as the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | ¬H), where ¬H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

Since the witness identifies people correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E | ¬H) = 0.2. Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26.

Substituting these values into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.27

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.27 or 27%.
