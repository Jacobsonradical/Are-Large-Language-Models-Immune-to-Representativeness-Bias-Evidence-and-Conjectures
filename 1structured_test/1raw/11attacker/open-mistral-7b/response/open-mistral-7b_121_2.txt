To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified him as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A. In this case, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence.
- P(B) is the probability of event B. In this case, the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given the information provided, we have:

- P(A|B) is what we want to find (probability that the attacker is black given the witness identification).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race, given that the attacker is black, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time).
- P(A) = Unknown prior probability of the attacker being black.
- P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.24 (the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2, and the probability of the witness making an error, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8. So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.24).

To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(A and B) or P(A and not B). Therefore, we cannot directly calculate P(A) and must assume a prior probability. A common assumption is to assume a prior probability that is equal to the prior population probability, which we have been given: P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black in the city).

Using these values, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.615

So, given the witness's identification and the information about the racial distribution in the city, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.615 or 61.5%.
