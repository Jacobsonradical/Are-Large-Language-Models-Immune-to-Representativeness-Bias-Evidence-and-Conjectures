Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Now, let's consider both scenarios:
a) The attacker is actually white: In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time.
b) The attacker is actually black: In this case, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black 80% of the time.

The total number of people the witness sees (and makes a judgment about their race) is the sum of the number of white and black people. Since we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate this:

Total population = 100% = 0.85 (white) + 0.15 (black)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

a) Probability of the attacker being white = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
Probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black if he's white = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%)

b) Probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if he's black = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider the probability of scenario b and multiply it by 1, and the probability of scenario a and multiply it by 0, to find the final estimate:

Probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement = 0.12 (if attacker is black) * 1 + 0.17 (if attacker is white) * 0 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the provided information and assumes perfect independence between the witness's observation and the attacker's race, which may not be the case in reality.
