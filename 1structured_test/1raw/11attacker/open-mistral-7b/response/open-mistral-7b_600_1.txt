To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's assume that the witness's racial identification is independent of the actual race of the attacker (which is a simplification, as bias might exist). In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 (80%).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker as white is the complement of the success rate, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is also 0.2 (20%), since the witness's error rate is the same for both races.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker as white is 0.8 (80%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, which is 0.8.

However, we must also consider the racial distribution of the city's population. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85, and the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.

To account for the witness's identification, we need to weight these probabilities by the probabilities of the witness making each type of error. The probability of the witness making a type I error (identifying a white attacker as black) is 0.2, and the probability of a type II error (identifying a black attacker as white) is also 0.2.

The probability of the witness making a type I error and the attacker actually being white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, and the probability of a type II error and the attacker actually being black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The total probability of the witness's identification being incorrect is therefore 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct and the attacker being black is the probability of a type II error and the attacker actually being black, which is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness's identification being correct and the attacker being black divided by the total probability of the witness's identification being incorrect, which is 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15.

However, since the witness's identification was not completely reliable, this estimate is likely to be an underestimate of the actual probability that the attacker is black. A more accurate estimate might take into account the reliability of the witness's identification in different lighting conditions, the distance at which the witness saw the attacker, and other factors.
