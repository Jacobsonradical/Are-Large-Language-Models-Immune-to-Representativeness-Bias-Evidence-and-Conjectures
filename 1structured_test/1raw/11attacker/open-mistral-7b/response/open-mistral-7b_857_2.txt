Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual racial distribution of the population, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of event A, P(B) is the prior probability of event B, and P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B given event A.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black".

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (the witness is always correct when the attacker is black)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)
- P(A|B) = the probability we want to find

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.9375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.9375 or 93.75%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual racial distribution of the population, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this estimate should be considered an approximation.
