Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is black) given some evidence. The formula is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identified attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have P(E|H) (the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis) from the witness's accuracy: 0.8 (80%).
We have P(H) (the prior probability of the hypothesis) from the city's racial composition: 0.15 (15%).

We don't have P(E) (the probability of the evidence), but we can estimate it using the witness's error rate: 0.2 (20%).

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2
       = 0.45

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence and the city's racial composition, is 0.45 (45%).

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.45}
