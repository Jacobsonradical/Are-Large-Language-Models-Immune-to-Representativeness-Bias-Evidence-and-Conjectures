Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's statement).

Let's denote the following events and probabilities:
- A: Attacker is black
- E: Witness identifies attacker as black
- W: Witness is white
- B: Witness is black

Since we don't have enough information about the witness's race, we make the assumption that the witness is a random selection from the city's population. Therefore, P(W) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the population is 50% white and 50% black).

We know that P(A|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time) and P(not A|E) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|E) as follows:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(A|E) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|E) = 0.41178

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
