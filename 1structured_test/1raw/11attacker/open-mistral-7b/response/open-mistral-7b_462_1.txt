To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error was misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa, we'll need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the error is equally likely to be one way or the other. This means that the witness's true error rate is actually 10% (20% / 2).

The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black. Given these numbers, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying the attacker as black.

If the attacker is actually white (85% probability), the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 10% of the time. If the attacker is black (15% probability), the witness will incorrectly identify them as white 10% of the time.

So, the total probability of the witness making a mistake and reporting a black attacker when the attacker is actually white is 0.85 * 0.10 = 0.0845 (or 8.45%).

Likewise, the probability of the witness making a mistake and reporting a black attacker when the attacker is actually black is 0.15 * 0.10 = 0.015 (or 1.5%).

Since we don't know which error is more likely, we need to consider both scenarios and sum their probabilities: 0.0845 + 0.015 = 0.0995 (or 9.95%).

However, the witness reported a black attacker, so we can subtract the probability of this error from 1 to get the probability of the attacker actually being black: 1 - 0.0995 = 0.9005 (or 90.05%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.9005} or 90.05%.
