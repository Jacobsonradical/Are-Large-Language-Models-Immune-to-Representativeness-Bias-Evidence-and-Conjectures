Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to accurately identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability. Since we don't know the exact circumstances of the witness's identification, we'll assume that the witness's identification is an independent event from the actual race of the attacker.

Under these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (identifying a black attacker as black) by multiplying the population proportion of black attackers (15%) and the witness's correct identification rate (80%):

Probability of correct identification = Population proportion of black attackers * Witness's correct identification rate
                                              = 0.15 * 0.8
                                              = 0.12

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an incorrect identification (identifying a white attacker as black) by multiplying the population proportion of white attackers (85%) and the witness's incorrect identification rate (20%):

Probability of incorrect identification = Population proportion of white attackers * Witness's incorrect identification rate
                                                = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                = 0.17

Since these two events (correct and incorrect identification) are mutually exclusive (the witness can't make both a correct and incorrect identification), we can add their probabilities to find the total probability distribution:

Total probability distribution = Probability of correct identification + Probability of incorrect identification
                                           = 0.12 + 0.17
                                           = 0.29

Since the total probability distribution must sum to 1, we can subtract it from 1 to find the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that she identified the attacker as black:

Probability of attacker being black | given witness's identification of attacker as black
                                  = Probability of correct identification / Total probability distribution
                                  = 0.12 / 0.29
                                  â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
