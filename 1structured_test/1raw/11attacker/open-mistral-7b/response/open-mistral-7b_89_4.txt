Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(h|e)) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(e|h)) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(h)), divided by the probability of the evidence (P(e)).

Let's break this down:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (P(h)).
2. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (P(e|h)). Since the witness incorrectly identifies people 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as 1 - the probability of correctly identifying a person.
3. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0, since a white person cannot be mistakenly identified as black (P(e|~h)).
4. The probability of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as black) is the sum of the probability of this happening given that the attacker is black (P(e|h)) and the probability of this happening given that the attacker is not black (P(e|~h)). Since the witness never mistakes a white person for a black one, this probability is equal to P(e|h).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(h|e) = P(e|h) * P(h) / P(e)

Substituting the values we have calculated:

P(h|e) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8)

P(h|e) = 0.12

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12%. This means that based on the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is actually black. However, it's important to note that this estimate relies on several assumptions, and actual probabilities may vary in real-world scenarios.
