Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness is mistaken. If the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, that would mean the attacker is actually white. Since 85% of the population is white, if the witness is making a mistake, there's a 15% chance that the attacker is white.

On the other hand, if the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is black.

So, the overall probability that the attacker is black, considering both the possibility of a correct witness identification and a mistaken one, is the sum of the probability of a correct identification and the probability of a mistake multiplied by the corresponding probabilities of the attacker's race given the mistake:

P(Attacker is Black) = P(Witness is Correct and Attacker is Black) + P(Witness is Mistaken and Attacker is White)

P(Witness is Correct and Attacker is Black) = P(Attacker is Black) * P(Witness is Correct | Attacker is Black) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

P(Witness is Mistaken and Attacker is White) = P(Attacker is White) * P(Witness is Mistaken | Attacker is White) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

P(Attacker is Black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's accuracy and the racial composition of the city, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
