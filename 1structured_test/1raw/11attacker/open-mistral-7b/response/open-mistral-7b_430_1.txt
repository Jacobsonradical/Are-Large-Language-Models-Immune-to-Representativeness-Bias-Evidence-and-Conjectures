To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of observing B given that A is true. This is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person.
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability of A before considering the evidence.
- P(B) is the probability of observing B, which is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black.

We are given that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is black, and 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.182

So, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.182 â‰ˆ 0.384

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.384 or 38.4%.
