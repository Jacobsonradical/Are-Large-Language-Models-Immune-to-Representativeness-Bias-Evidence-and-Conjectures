To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is black) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying black people).
3. To find the total probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black, we add the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
