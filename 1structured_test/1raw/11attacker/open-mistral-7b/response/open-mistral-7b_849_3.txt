Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black might not necessarily reflect the actual race of the attacker.

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This information suggests that the probability of the attacker being black is 15%.

However, when considering the witness's identification, we should take into account the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, there's a 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and the witness being correct (0.15 * 0.8) and the probability of the attacker being white and the witness making an error (0.85 * 0.2).

The calculation gives us a probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which might not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be treated with caution.

In summary, based on the available information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
