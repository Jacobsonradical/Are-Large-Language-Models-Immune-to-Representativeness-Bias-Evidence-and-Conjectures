Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial distribution of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, we do not know if the witness saw the attacker clearly enough to make a reliable identification or if they were simply guessing. Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot use their description to confirm the witness's identification.

Given this uncertainty, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the information provided.

{probability: undefined, please note that the information provided does not allow for a reliable estimate}
