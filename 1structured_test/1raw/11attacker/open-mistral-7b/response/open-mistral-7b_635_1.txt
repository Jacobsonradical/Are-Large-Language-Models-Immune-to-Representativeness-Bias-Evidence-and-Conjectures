To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white, which is the complementary probability to the witness correctly identifying a black person.

Let's denote the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white as p. Then, we have:

P(witness misidentifies black person) = 1 - P(witness correctly identifies black person)
= 1 - 0.80
= 0.20

Now, let's denote the total number of people in the sample as S, with 15% being black and 85% being white. Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white, there must be a white person in the sample who was incorrectly identified as black by the witness. Therefore, the ratio of misidentified black people to misidentified white people is 1:1.

The probability of picking a black person at random is 15% (or 0.15), and the probability of picking a white person at random is 85% (or 0.85). The probability of picking a white person after misidentifying a black person as white is 0.85, and the probability of picking a black person after misidentifying a white person as black is 0.15.

Since the witness misidentifies a black person as white with probability 0.20, the probability of picking a white person after misidentifying a black person as white is:

P(picking white person | misidentifying black person) = 0.85

Similarly, since the witness misidentifies a white person as black with probability 0.20, the probability of picking a black person after misidentifying a white person as black is:

P(picking black person | misidentifying white person) = 0.15

Since the ratio of misidentified black people to misidentified white people is 1:1, we have:

P(picking black person | misidentifying black person) = P(picking white person | misidentifying white person)

Using this information, we can set up the following equations:

0.20 * P(picking black person | misidentifying black person) = 0.15
0.20 * P(picking white person | misidentifying white person) = 0.85

Now, we can solve for P(picking black person | misidentifying black person) and P(picking white person | misidentifying white person):

P(picking black person | misidentifying black person) = 0.15 / 0.20 = 0.75
P(picking white person | misidentifying white person) = 0.85 / 0.20 = 4.25

But since the probability of picking a person must be between 0 and 1, we can take the maximum value of 1 for P(picking white person | misidentifying white person), which gives us:

P(picking black person | misidentifying black person) = 0.75

Now, to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness misidentifies black person) * P(picking black person | misidentifying black person)
                              = 0.20 * 0.75
                              = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15%.
