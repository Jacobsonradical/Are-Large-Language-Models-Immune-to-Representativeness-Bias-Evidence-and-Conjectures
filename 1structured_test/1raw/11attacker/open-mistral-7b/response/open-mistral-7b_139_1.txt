To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85 and that of a black person is 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is therefore 0.15 (probability of encountering a black person) * 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) = 0.12 (or 12%).

On the other hand, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (probability of encountering a white person) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, the witness reported seeing a black person. So, the probability we're interested in is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (error) = 0.29 (or 29%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.29}
