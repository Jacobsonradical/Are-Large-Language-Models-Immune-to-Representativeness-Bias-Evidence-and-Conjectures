To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, event B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), can be estimated using the population statistics provided:

P(A) = number of black people / total population
P(A) = 15% / (85% + 15%) = 0.15 / 1.00 = 0.15

The likelihood of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black, P(B|A), is given in the first piece of information:

P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.80) * (1 - 0.15))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.08)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.20 = 0.60

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.60 or 60%.
