Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. However, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, we can assume that when the witness identifies a person as black, there is a 1 - error rate = 0.8 * 100% = 80% chance that the person is actually black, and a 20% chance that the person is white.

However, the witness's identification does not provide any information about the actual racial makeup of the attacker, as the witness could have made an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification alone is not useful in this case.

However, if we assume that the witness's identification is accurate (which is not supported by the information provided), then the probability that the attacker is black is 100%. If we assume that the witness's identification is an error, then the probability that the attacker is black is 20%.

But since we cannot determine whether the witness's identification is accurate or not, the best estimate would be to consider the racial composition of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%.
