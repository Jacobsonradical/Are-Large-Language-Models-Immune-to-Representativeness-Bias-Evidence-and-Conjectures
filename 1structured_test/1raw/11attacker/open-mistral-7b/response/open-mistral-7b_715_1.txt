Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B (probability of attacker being black given witnessed race),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of witnessing the attacker's race given that the attacker is black (witness's accuracy in identifying black people),
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (population percentage of black people),
- P(B) is the probability of witnessing the attacker's race (which is the same as P(A) because the attacker's race is not known, so we can assume it doesn't affect the witness's observation).

Given our information:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (population percentage of black people)

We don't have direct information about P(B), but since it's the same as P(A), we can use P(A) instead.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witnessed race is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / (0.15) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
