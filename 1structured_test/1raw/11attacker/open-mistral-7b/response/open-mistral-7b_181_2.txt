Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black (H), and the evidence is the witness's statement (E). The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)) can be estimated based on the city's demographics, which is 15% or 0.15.

The probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black (P(E|H)) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).

The probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is not black (P(E|~H)) can be estimated as the complementary probability of P(E|H) given the minority proportion of blacks in the city, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

After calculating, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.73

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.73 or 73%.
