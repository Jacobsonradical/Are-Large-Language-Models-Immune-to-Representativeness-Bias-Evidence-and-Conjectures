Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness, who is not perfect at identifying races, correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. However, the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness's identification is correct.
Scenario 2: The attacker is actually white. In this case, there's a chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black due to their error rate.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can say that the likelihood of Scenario 1 happening is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of Scenario 1 is 0.8.

On the other hand, Scenario 2 is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of Scenario 2 is 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability of a white person being attacked and mistakenly identified as black. Therefore, we can only provide the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's identification.

{probability: 0.8}
