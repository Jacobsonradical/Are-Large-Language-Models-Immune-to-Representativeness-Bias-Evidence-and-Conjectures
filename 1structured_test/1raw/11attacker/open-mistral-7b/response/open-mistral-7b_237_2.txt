To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the overall racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as identifying the race correctly 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, since we don't know if the witness's error was in identifying a black person as white or vice versa, we can't use this information directly.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the likelihood of encountering a white person is higher than a black person. Therefore, if the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, it's more likely that the actual attacker was white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the witness's error as P(E). We want to find P(B), given the information that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, and the actual population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness's error given an actual black attacker is P(E|B) = 0.2 (20%).

On the other hand, if the attacker is white, the probability of the witness mistaking him for a black person is higher, given that the population is 85% white. Let's denote this probability as P(E|W). We don't have enough information to calculate this directly, but since the witness is more likely to make an error when the actual attacker is white, we can assume that P(E|W) > 0.2.

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is P(C|B) = 0.8 (80%).

The probability of the witness identifying a white attacker as black is P(C|W) = 1 - P(E|W). Since P(E|W) > 0.2, we can assume that P(C|W) < 0.8.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony is:

P(B|C) = P(C|B) * P(B) / [P(C|B) * P(B) + P(C|W) * P(W)]

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W) directly. Therefore, we cannot calculate P(B|C) strictly.

To provide an estimate, we can assume that P(W) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city). Under this assumption:

P(B|C) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + P(C|W) * (0.85)]

To find P(C|W), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(C|W) = P(W|C) * P(C) / P(W)

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(W|C) or P(C), we can't calculate P(C|W) directly. Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate.

However, given that P(W|C) is likely to be lower than 0.8 (given that the witness is more likely to make an error when the actual attacker is white), the estimate for P(B|C) is likely to be higher than 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city).
