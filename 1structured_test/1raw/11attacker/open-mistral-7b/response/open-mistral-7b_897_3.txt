To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the majority of the people the witness encounters are white. Therefore, if the witness errs in identifying a person's race, it is more likely that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black than a black person as white.

Given this information, the probability that the witness's mistake was identifying a white person as black is higher than the probability that the witness's mistake was not identifying a black person as black.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability of the witness's mistake being a white person misidentified as black. To make an estimate, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between the two possible errors (white misidentified as black and black misidentified as white).

So, we can assume that the error rate is 10% for each type of error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus half of the error rate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8 (80%) + 0.05 (5% of the error rate) = 0.855, approximately 85.5%}

This estimate assumes that the error rate is equally distributed between the two types of errors, which might not be the case in reality. In a more accurate calculation, the error rate should be adjusted based on the racial composition of the population the witness encounters. But with the given information, this is the best estimate we can provide.
