Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness's identification was correct in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. But this information alone does not provide a probability that the attacker is black as we don't know if the attacker was among the people the witness observed.

Therefore, without additional information, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in the format you requested. The probability would depend on the context and the specific circumstances under which the witness made the identification.
