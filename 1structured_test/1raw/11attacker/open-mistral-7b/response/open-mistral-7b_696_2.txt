To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so P(witness corrects and attacker is black) = 0.8 * P(black).

The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(witness incorrectly identifies and attacker is black) = 0.2 * P(white) = 0.2 * (1 - P(black)).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability of this event is the sum of the two probabilities above:

P(witness identifies attacker as black) = P(witness corrects and attacker is black) + P(witness incorrectly identifies and attacker is black)

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.9

Solving for P(black), we find:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.64

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.64, or 64%.
