Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the accuracy of the witness in determining race.

1. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time but makes errors 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot assume with certainty that the witness's identification is correct because we do not know the exact circumstances or conditions under which the identification was made.

Let's assume that the witness's identification is an independent event, meaning that the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black does not depend on the actual race of the attacker. Under this assumption, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (given that the attacker is black) is 0.8 (80%).

However, if the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. Since the city is predominantly white (85%), the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 (20%).

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of a black attacker multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, plus the probability of a white attacker multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker:

(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it seems there may be an error in the witness's accuracy rate or the demographics provided.

To provide a more accurate estimate, additional information about the witness's ability to accurately identify race in the specific conditions of the attack would be required.
