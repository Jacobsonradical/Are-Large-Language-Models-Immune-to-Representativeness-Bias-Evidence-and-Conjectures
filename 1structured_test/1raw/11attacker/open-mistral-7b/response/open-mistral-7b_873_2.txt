To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = probability of the attacker being black
- P(B|A) = probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black = 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
- P(B|~A) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black = 0.2 (from the first piece of information)
- P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(~A) * P(A|~B) (Bayes' theorem)

We are also given the prior probability P(A) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information, since 85% of the population is white).

Now we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(~A) * P(A|~B)
P(A) = (0.2) * (0.1) + (0.8) * (0)
P(A) = 0.02

However, it seems there's a mistake in the second piece of information, as the sum of the population proportions, 0.15 + 0.85 = 1.0, which is not possible. The correct population proportions should add up to 1.

Assuming the population is 50% white and 50% black:

P(A) = 0.5 (probability of the attacker being black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (from the first piece of information)

Now we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(~B) * P(A|~B)
P(A) = (0.8) * (0.5) + (0.2) * (0)
P(A) = 0.4

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is 0.4 or 40%.
