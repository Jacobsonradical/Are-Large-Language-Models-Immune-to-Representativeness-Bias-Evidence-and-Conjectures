To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that when they see a white person, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time, and when they see a black person, they mistakenly identify them as white 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is P(black), and the probability that they incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.8 * P(white), where 0.8 is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as white.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up an equation:

P(black) = 0.8 * P(white) + 0.2 * 0

However, we have another piece of information about the racial distribution of the population. We know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85.

Now we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.8 * 0.85
P(black) â‰ˆ 0.68

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.68, or 68%.
