To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

This leaves us with 83% (100% - 17%) as the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. However, this probability is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case. Therefore, to be conservative, we can use the original racial composition of the city as our estimate.
