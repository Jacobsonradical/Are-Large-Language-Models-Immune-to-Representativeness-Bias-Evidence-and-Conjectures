Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and mistakes 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't know if the witness's sample was representative of the city's population or if the witness had any bias in identifying races.

Assuming the witness's sample was representative of the city's population and there was no bias in the witness's identification, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as such (given that the attacker is black). Since the sample is half white and half black, the witness will correctly identify a black person 80% of the time, making the probability 0.8.

However, the attacker could also be white, in which case the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. Since the city is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Multiplying this probability by the probability of the witness mistaking a white person for black gives us the probability of the witness falsely identifying the attacker as black, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the attacker is mistakenly identified as black, which is 0.15 (the true black population proportion) + 0.17 (the probability of mistaken identification) = 0.32 or 32%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's sample was representative of the city's population and that there was no bias in the witness's identification. Without knowing more about these factors, it's difficult to provide a more accurate estimate.
