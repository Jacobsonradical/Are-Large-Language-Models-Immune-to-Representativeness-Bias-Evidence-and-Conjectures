To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

The witness has an error rate of 20% in identifying races, which means they correctly identify races 80% of the time. If we assume that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the actual race of the person, and that the attacker's race is equally likely to be black or white, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white (which is 1 - P(black))
- P(witness says black|black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(witness says black|white) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black

We are given that P(witness says black|black) = 0.8 and P(witness says black|white) = 0.2. We are also given that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(black):

P(black) = P(witness says black) * P(black|witness says black) / (P(witness says black) * P(black|witness says black) + P(witness says not black) * P(not black|witness says not black))

We are given that P(witness says black) = P(black) + P(white) * P(witness says black|white) = P(black) + 0.85 * 0.2 = P(black) + 0.17

So, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(black) = P(black) * 0.8 / (P(black) * 0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2)

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2 / 0.8) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.034) = 0.8 / 1.034 â‰ˆ 0.778

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.778 or 77.8%.
