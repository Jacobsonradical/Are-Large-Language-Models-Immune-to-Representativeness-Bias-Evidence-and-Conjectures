To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85 and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

The witness's overall accuracy in identifying race is 0.8, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2. Since the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, and since the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85, the probability of the witness making no error is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68.

The total probability of the witness making a correct identification is the sum of these three probabilities: 0.8 * 0.15 (correctly identifying a black person) + 0.68 (correctly identifying a white person) + 0.17 (mistakenly identifying a white person as black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the total probability of making a correct identification: (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.68 + 0.17) = 0.12.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
