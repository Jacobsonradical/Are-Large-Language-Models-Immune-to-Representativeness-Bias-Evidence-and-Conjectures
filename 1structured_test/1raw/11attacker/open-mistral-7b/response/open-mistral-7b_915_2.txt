The information provided consists of two parts: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.

However, it is important to note that the witness's error rate is not specified for identifying black individuals versus white individuals. If the error rate is the same for both races, then the witness's identification would be biased towards the majority race (85% white).

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it could be an error based on the witness's bias or it could be an accurate identification. Without more information, it is not possible to determine the probability that the attacker is black with certainty.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate between 0 and 1. However, given the bias of the witness, the probability might be lower than 15%. It would require further investigation to determine the exact probability.
