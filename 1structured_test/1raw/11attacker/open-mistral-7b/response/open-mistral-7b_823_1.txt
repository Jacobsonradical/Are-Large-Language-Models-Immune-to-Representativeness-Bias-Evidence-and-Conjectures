To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before the witness identification)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (probability of the witness making this identification, regardless of the attacker's race)

First, let's find the prior probability P(H):
Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of an attacker being black is 15%.

Next, let's find the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E | H):
The witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker was black.

Now, let's find the probability of the evidence, P(E):
Since the witness incorrectly identified a person's race 20% of the time, this means that they correctly identified race 80% of the time. Since the population is half white and half black, the probability of the witness making this identification, regardless of the attacker's race, is 0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.5 (probability of a white person) + 0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.5 (probability of a black person) = 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8 (note that since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of their correct identification is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8)

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):
P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 12%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12}
