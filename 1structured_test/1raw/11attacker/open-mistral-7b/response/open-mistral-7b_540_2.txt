Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

However, the witness's statement does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness made an error 20% of the time. We cannot simply take the witness's statement at face value and assume that the attacker is black with a probability of 80%.

On the other hand, we cannot assume that the attacker is white either, as the witness did not identify the attacker as white. But given the demographic information, it's more likely that a random person in the city is white (85%) than black (15%).

Since we cannot directly use the witness's statement, and given the city's demographic information, a reasonable estimate would be to assign a higher probability to the majority race, which is white. However, we should also consider the error rate of the witness.

Given these considerations, a conservative estimate would be to use the demographic information and subtract the error rate of the witness from it. This would give us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is actually black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black would be:

{probability: 0.15 - 0.20 * 0.8 = 0.11, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate suggests that the attacker is likely to be black with a probability of approximately 11%. However, this is a rough estimate and should not be used in any legal or official context without further investigation.
