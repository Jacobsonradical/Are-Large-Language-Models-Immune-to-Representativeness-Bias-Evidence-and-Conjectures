To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect. In 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, but in 20% of cases, the witness makes an error.

The witness reported that the attacker was black. If the witness's report is accurate, then the attacker is indeed black. If the witness is making an error, then the attacker is likely to be white, given the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the witness is making an error as "p". The probability that the witness is reporting the truth is then 1 - p.

Given that the witness reports the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability that the witness is reporting the truth times the probability that a black person is in the city:

P(attacker is black | witness report) = (1 - p) * 0.15

Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness is making an error is p = 0.20.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness report, is:

P(attacker is black | witness report) = (1 - 0.20) * 0.15 = 0.135

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.5%.
