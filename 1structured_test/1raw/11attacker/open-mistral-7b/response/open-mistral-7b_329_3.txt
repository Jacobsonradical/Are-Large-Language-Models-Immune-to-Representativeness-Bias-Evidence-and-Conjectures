To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying race)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (before considering the hypothesis)

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H) is given in the first piece of information. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H) is given in the second piece of information. The population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E) can be calculated as the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|not H), where not H is the complement of H, or the attacker being white. P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person, which is given as 0.8 in the first piece of information. So, P(E|not H) = 0.8, and P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.792.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.792 â‰ˆ 0.111

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 11.1%.
