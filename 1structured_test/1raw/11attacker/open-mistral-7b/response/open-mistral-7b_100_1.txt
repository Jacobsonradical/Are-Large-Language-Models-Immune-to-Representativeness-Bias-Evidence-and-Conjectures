Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The general probability of an attacker being black in the city. This is given by the city's demographic data: 15% or 0.15.

2. The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the error rate is 20% or 0.20.

The witness reported that the attacker was black. If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. However, there's also a chance that the witness is wrong. In this case, the witness misidentified a white person as black.

Given that the witness's error rate is 0.20, the probability that a witness mistake leads to the misidentification of a white person as black is 0.20. Since there are 85% white people in the city, the probability of picking a white person at random is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a mistake when picking a white person is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness reported that the attacker was black, the only way for this to be a mistake is if the witness misidentified a white person as black. The probability of this happening is 0.17.

So, the total probability of the witness's report being a mistake is the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black: 0.17.

Since the probability of the attacker being black in the city is 0.15, and the probability of the witness's report being a mistake is 0.17, the probability that the attacker is actually white but the witness mistakenly reported that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.17 = 0.0255 or 2.55%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is the probability of the attacker being black minus the probability of the witness's report being a mistake: 0.15 - 0.0255 = 0.1245 or 12.45%.

{probability: 0.1245}

This means that, based on the information provided, the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of around 12.45%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and may not reflect the actual situation perfectly.
