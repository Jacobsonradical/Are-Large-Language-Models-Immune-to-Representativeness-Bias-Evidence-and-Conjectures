To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following information:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we do not know but want to estimate.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given by the witness's ability, which is 0.8.
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which is 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2.
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information, as 15% of the population is black)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (given in the information, as 85% of the population is white)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)].

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.192

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 19.2%.
