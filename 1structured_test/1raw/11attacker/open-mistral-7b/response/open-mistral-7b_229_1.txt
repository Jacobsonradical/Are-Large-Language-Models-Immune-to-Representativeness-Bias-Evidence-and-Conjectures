To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

First, let's calculate P(E|H). The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (correct) + 0.2 (error) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate P(H). Given the city's demographics, 15% of the population is black:

P(H) = 0.15 (black population)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider both the probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly and the probability of the witness identifying a white person correctly:

P(E|white) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
P(E|black) = 0.8 (witness accuracy rate)

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black:

P(white) = 0.85 (white population)
P(black) = 0.15 (black population)

So:

P(E) = P(E|white) * P(white) + P(E|black) * P(black)
P(E) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.37

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.2973 (or 29.73%)

So, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 29.73%.
