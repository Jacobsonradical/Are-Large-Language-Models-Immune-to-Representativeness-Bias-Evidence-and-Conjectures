To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker being black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of a black person, P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in, P(B|A) is given in the first piece of information (80%), P(A) is the prior probability which we can estimate from the population distribution given in the second piece of information (15%), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person, which can be calculated as the product of the probability of the witness being correct (0.8) and the probability of the attacker being black (0.15).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
