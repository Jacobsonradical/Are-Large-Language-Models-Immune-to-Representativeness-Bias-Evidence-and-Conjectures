To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. Given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a random person as black, even if they are actually white.

Let's denote the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black as "p" and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black as "q". Since the total probability of identifying a person as black should be equal to the actual proportion of black people in the population, we have:

p * 0.15 + q * 0.85 = 0.15

We know that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, so p = 0.8. We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time, and half of these errors are made when identifying whites as black, so q = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Now we can substitute these values into our equation:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.15

Solving for q, we get q = 0.1.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, and the probability of this happening if the attacker is white is q = 0.1, the probability of the attacker being black is 1 - q = 0.9.

Therefore, {probability: 0.9} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
