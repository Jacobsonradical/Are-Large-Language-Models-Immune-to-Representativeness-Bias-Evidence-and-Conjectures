To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the evidence is the witness's statement about the attacker's race. The prior probability is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which we can estimate from the city's demographic data.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black,
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black,
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness making the observation "the attacker is black" given that the attacker is black,
- P(B|~W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black,
- P(~W|B) as the probability of the witness making the observation "the witness did not identify the attacker as black" given that the attacker is black,
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black,
- P(~W|~B) as the probability of the witness making the observation "the witness did not identify the attacker as black" given that the attacker is not black.

The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

From the information provided, we know:
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(~W|B) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the race 20% of the time)
- P(W|~B) and P(~B) are not provided, but we can assume that they are related to P(W|B) and P(B) through the total probability constraint: P(W|~B) * P(~B) + P(W|B) * P(B) = 1

To solve for P(W|~B), we can use the total probability constraint:

P(W|~B) = [1 - P(W|B)] / P(~B)

Substituting P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15 into the equation, we get:

P(W|~B) = [1 - 0.8] / P(~B)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 / P(~B)

Now, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem in terms of P(~B):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 / P(~B)]

We can see that we have an equation with one unknown (P(~B)). Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to solve for P(~B) directly. However, we can still provide an estimate for P(B|W) based on the available information.

Since P(~B) is not provided, we can make an assumption that P(W|~B) and P(~B) are symmetrical to P(W|B) and P(B). This assumption is not necessarily true in reality, but it allows us to make a rough estimate.

If we assume that P(W|~B) = 0.8 and P(~B) = 0.15, we can calculate:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15]
P(B|W) = 0.12

So, based on the available information and the assumption that P(W|~B) and P(~B) are symmetrical to P(W|B) and P(B), our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it is important to note that this estimate is likely to be highly uncertain due to the assumptions made.
