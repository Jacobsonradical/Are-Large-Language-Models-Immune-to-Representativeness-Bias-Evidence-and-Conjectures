Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E_1 as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are looking for P(H|E_1), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|E_1) = P(E_1|H) \* P(H) / P(E_1)

1. P(E_1|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 0.15 (15%).
3. P(E_1) is the probability of the witness making any identification, which is the sum of P(E_1|H) and P(E_1|¬H), where ¬H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E_1|¬H) is 0.2 (20%).

Now, we can compute P(H|E_1):

P(H|E_1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(H|E_1) ≈ 0.266

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is about 26.6%.
