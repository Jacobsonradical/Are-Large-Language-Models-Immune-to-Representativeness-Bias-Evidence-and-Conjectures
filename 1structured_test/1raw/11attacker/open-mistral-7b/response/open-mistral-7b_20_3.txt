To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The reliability of the witness: When presented with a half white and half black sample, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we don't have enough information to know if the witness saw the attacker from a distance or in poor lighting conditions, which could affect their ability to accurately identify the attacker's race. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is consistent regardless of the conditions, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A) is the prior probability (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's statement),
- P(B) is the likelihood (the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black),
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability (the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement),
- P(B|A) is the conditional probability (the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black).

Given that the witness stated that the attacker is black, P(B) = 1.

The prior probability P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black in the city. Since 15% of the city's population is black, P(A) = 0.15.

The conditional probability P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the race of a black person. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 1 = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's accuracy is consistent regardless of the conditions, which may not be the case. If the witness's accuracy was lower in the conditions of the attack, the probability would be lower, and if it was higher, the probability would be higher. Without more information, it's difficult to provide a more precise estimate.
