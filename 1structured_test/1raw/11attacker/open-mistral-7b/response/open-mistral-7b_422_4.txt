Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- H: The attacker is black
- ~H: The attacker is not black (or white)
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of prior information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is white)

We are also given the conditional probability of the witness making a correct identification:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find that the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.226.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.226}.
