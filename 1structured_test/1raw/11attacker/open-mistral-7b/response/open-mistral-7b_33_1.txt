Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate. They make errors 20% of the time.
3. When the witness sees a person who is half white and half black, they incorrectly identify the person's race 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the case where the attacker is actually white:

1. If the attacker is white, there is a 85% chance that the witness will misidentify the race due to their error rate of 20%.

Now, let's consider the case where the attacker is black:

1. If the attacker is black, there is a 15% chance that the witness will misidentify the race due to their error rate of 20%.

Since we don't have any additional information suggesting that the attacker is more likely to be white or black, we should consider both cases equally likely. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by subtracting the probability of the witness misidentifying a white attacker from 100%:

Probability of attacker being black = 100% - Probability of witness misidentifying white attacker
= 100% - (85% * 0.2)
= 100% - 17%
= 83%

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we need to correct this error. The probability of the attacker being black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
