Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is given in the first piece of information: P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is provided in the second piece of information: P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

The likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (P(E|~H)) is the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is white. Since half of the population is white, and the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying race, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness errs 10% of the time when the attacker is white).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

We know P(H) and P(E|H), so we can calculate P(~H), the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (the attacker being white), which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

We also know P(E|~H), so we can now calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.176

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.6%.
