Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, who is not perfect, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if the witness was correct or not, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as "p" and the probability that the witness errs as "e = 0.2".

The victim's inability to see the attacker's race means that the attacker's race should be considered as a random variable with probability distribution given by the racial composition of the city. Assuming independence between the race of the attacker and the witness's error, the probability that the witness errs and identifies the attacker as black is e * p + (1 - p).

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. So, we can set up the following equality:

e * p + (1 - p) = 0.8

Since we don't have enough information to solve for p directly, we cannot provide a strict numerical probability estimate. But we can derive some insight from the equation:

The probability that the attacker is black (p) should be greater than (0.8 - 0.2 * p) for the witness's identification to make sense. Solving the inequality, we get p > 0.6.

So, according to the given information, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, the exact probability cannot be determined without more specific information.

{probability: greater than 0.6, but no exact number can be provided}
