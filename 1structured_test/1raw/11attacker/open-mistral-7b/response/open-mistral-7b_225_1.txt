To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) as follows:

False positive rate = 1 - Witness accuracy rate
                                 = 1 - 0.8
                                 = 0.2

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of a true positive (correctly identifying a black person) as follows:

True positive rate = Proportion of black people * Witness accuracy rate
                                 = 0.15 * 0.8
                                 = 0.12

The attack occurred at night, so the witness could not see the attacker's race with 100% certainty. The witness's identification is therefore a source of uncertainty, which we can model as a Bayes factor.

The Bayes factor is a ratio of the probability of the data given the hypothesis (the attacker is black) to the probability of the data given the alternative hypothesis (the attacker is white). In this case, the data is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The probability of the data given the alternative hypothesis can be calculated as follows:

Probability of data given alternative hypothesis = False positive rate
                                                                           = 0.2

The probability of the data given the hypothesis can be calculated as the true positive rate.

Bayes factor = Probability of data given hypothesis / Probability of data given alternative hypothesis
                      = 0.12 / 0.2
                      = 0.6

The Bayes factor of 0.6 indicates that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is somewhat less likely than if the attacker were white. However, this is not enough information to definitively conclude that the attacker is white.

Since we cannot definitively conclude that the attacker is white, we must assign a probability of 0 to this hypothesis. The probability of the attacker being black is therefore 1 minus the probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - 0 = 1.

However, this answer is not based on the Bayes factor, which takes into account the witness's accuracy and the racial composition of the population. A more rigorous answer would be to use the Bayes factor to update our prior belief in the attacker's race based on the witness's identification.

Given that the witness's identification is only somewhat less likely than if the attacker were white, it seems reasonable to assign a non-negligible probability to the hypothesis that the attacker is black. However, the exact probability cannot be determined without more information.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information. The answer depends on how much weight one assigns to the witness's identification in the face of uncertainty.
