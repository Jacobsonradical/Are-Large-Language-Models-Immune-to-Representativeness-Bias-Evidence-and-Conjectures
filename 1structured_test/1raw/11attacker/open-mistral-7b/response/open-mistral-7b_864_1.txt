To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly picked person is white is 0.85.

When the witness sees a person, they classify them as white with a probability of 0.85 and as black with a probability of 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. However, they are not perfectly accurate, so they will occasionally misclassify white people as black (with a probability of 0.2) and black people as white (with a probability of 0.2).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is the probability of picking a black person times the probability of correctly identifying that person as black. This is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is the probability of picking a black person times the probability of incorrectly identifying that person as white. This is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black. So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12.

In summary:
{probability: 0.12}
