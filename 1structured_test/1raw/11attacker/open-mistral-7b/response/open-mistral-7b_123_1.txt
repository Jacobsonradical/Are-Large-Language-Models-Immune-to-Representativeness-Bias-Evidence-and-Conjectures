Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate, identified the attacker as black.

We cannot directly use the witness's identification as evidence, as it's subject to error. However, we can use it to infer a range of probabilities.

Let's assume the true race of the attacker is X, where X can be either white (W) or black (B). The probability of the witness's identification being correct if the attacker is actually black (P(B|B)) is the witness's accuracy rate, 0.8.

Similarly, the probability of the witness's identification being correct if the attacker is actually white (P(B|W)) is the witness's error rate, 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up the following conditional probabilities:

P(B|observation) = [P(B|B) * P(B)] + [P(B|W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|observation) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, given the witness's identification and the city's population, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is 0.29. However, it's important to note that the witness's identification is not conclusive evidence and there may be other factors at play. Therefore, this probability should be interpreted with caution.
