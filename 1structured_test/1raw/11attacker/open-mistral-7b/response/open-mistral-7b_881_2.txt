To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is black
- q: the probability that the attacker is white

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, so the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2. Similarly, the probability of correctly identifying a white person as white is 0.95 (given that 85% of the population is white), and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.05.

Given the witness's statement, in 20% of the cases, the witness errs in identifying a person's race. This means that the probability of erring in identifying a black person as white is equal to the probability of erring in identifying a white person as black. Therefore, we have:

0.2 = 0.05 * q + 0.2 * p

Solving this equation for p, we find that p = 0.6.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.6}
