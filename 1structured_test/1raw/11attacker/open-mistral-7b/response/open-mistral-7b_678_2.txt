Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we want to find P(H|E), where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the person was not black)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.325

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.325 or 32.5%.
