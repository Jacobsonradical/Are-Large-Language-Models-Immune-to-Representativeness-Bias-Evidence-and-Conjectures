Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following:
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black in the city)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying race 20% of the time)

We don't have explicit information about P(E), but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Since P(~H) = 1 - P(H), we can substitute this into the equation:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
    = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.1785
    = 0.3

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
      = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.3
      = 0.12 / 0.3
      = 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
