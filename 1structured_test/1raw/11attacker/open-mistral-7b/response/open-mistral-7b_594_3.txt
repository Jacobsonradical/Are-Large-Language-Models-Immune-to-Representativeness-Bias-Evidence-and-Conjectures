To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as identifying race correctly 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time. This means that if the actual population proportion of blacks is p, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is 0.2 * p (since the error rate is 20%), and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 * p.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is therefore 0.8 * p.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as white is 0.2 * (1 - p), since the error rate is 20% and the actual proportion of whites is 1 - p.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is given by the ratio of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black to the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

(0.8 * p) / (0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p))

We are given that 85% of the population is white, so p = 0.15. Plugging this value into the equation, we get:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.6585

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
