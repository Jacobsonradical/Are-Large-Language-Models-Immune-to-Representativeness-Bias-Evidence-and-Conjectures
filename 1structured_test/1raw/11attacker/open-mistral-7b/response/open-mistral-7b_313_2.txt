The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the city, can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.
2. In a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85, and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.
3. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is also 20%.
4. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is therefore 1 - the probability of mistakenly identifying a black person as white, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
5. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8}.
