Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black) = [P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black:

P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the information in "a")

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is white:

P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (from the information in "a")

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of the attacker being black and white, respectively:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the information in "b")
P(Attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the information in "b")

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.12

So, our estimate, strictly in the dictionary format, is: {probability: 0.12}
