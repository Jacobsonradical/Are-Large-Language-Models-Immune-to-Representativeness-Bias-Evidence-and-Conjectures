Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(H|E): probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification
- P(E): probability of the witness identifying someone as black

Given the information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

- P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.182

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
