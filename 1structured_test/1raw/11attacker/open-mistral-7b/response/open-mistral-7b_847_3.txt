To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

From piece of information "a", we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

From piece of information "b", we know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.

Since the attacker's race is unknown, we can assume that the attacker could be either black or white. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black) and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can say that if the attacker was indeed black, the witness's identification would be correct. On the other hand, if the attacker was white, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify him as black.

So, we can write the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black as P(black) * 1 (since the identification is correct when the attacker is black), and the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is white as P(white) * 0.2 (since there is a 20% chance of an error when the attacker is white).

The probability of the witness's identification given the actual attacker's race can be written as:

P(witness's identification|attacker is black) = P(black) * 1
P(witness's identification|attacker is white) = P(white) * 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can say that the probability of the witness's identification is equal to the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black:

P(witness's identification) = P(witness's identification|attacker is black)

Now we can set up an equation based on the Bayes' theorem:

P(witness's identification) = P(witness's identification|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness's identification|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's identification|attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) / P(witness's identification|attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(witness's identification) = P(black) * P(witness's identification|attacker is black) / (P(black) * P(witness's identification|attacker is black) + P(white) * P(witness's identification|attacker is white))

From the information given, we can calculate the values for P(black), P(witness's identification|attacker is black), P(white), and P(witness's identification|attacker is white).

P(black) = 0.15
P(witness's identification|attacker is black) = 1
P(white) = 0.85
P(witness's identification|attacker is white) = 0.2

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(witness's identification) = 0.15 * 1 / (0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2)

Calculating the value, we get:

P(witness's identification) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(witness's identification) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(witness's identification) = 0.46875

Since the witness's identification is equal to the probability of the attacker being black, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.46875}
