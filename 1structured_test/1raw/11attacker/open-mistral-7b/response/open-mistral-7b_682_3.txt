To provide an estimate, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the population.

Let's denote W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race and E as the event that the attacker is black. From the given information, we know that P(W|E) = 0.8 and P(W|not E) = 0.2. We also know that P(E) is the probability we're trying to find.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate P(not E) as follows:

P(not E) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(E):

P(E) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)

We can simplify P(W|not E) as P(W|E) * P(not E) / P(E) because P(W|not E) = 1 - P(W|E).

So, P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|E) * P(not E) * (1 - P(E) / P(not E))

Since P(E) + P(not E) = 1, we have P(not E) = 1 - P(E).

Now, we can rearrange the equation for P(E):

P(E) = P(W|E) * P(E) / (P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|E) * (1 - P(E)))

We can't solve this equation directly, but we can calculate its value for several possible values of P(E) and find the one that best fits the given information.

For example, if P(E) = 0.25, then P(W|E) * P(E) = 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05, and P(W|E) * P(not E) = 0.2 * 0.75 = 0.15. So, P(W) = 0.05 + 0.15 * (1 - 0.25 / 0.75) = 0.15, which is significantly lower than the observed 80% probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race.

Similarly, if P(E) = 0.5, then P(W|E) * P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4, and P(W|E) * P(not E) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4. So, P(W) = 0.4 + 0.4 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.6, which is closer to the observed 80% probability.

However, since the information provided about the racial composition of the population is more reliable, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be white than black. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for P(E) would be less than 0.5.

So, based on the given information, it seems that the probability that the attacker is black is less than 0.5. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a more precise estimate.
