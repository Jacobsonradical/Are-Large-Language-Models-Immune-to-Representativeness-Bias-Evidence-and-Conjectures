Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, where they are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, there's a crucial piece of information missing: how reliable is the witness's identification in this specific case? We only know the witness's general accuracy, but we don't know if their accuracy is higher or lower than 80% in this instance due to the poor lighting or other factors. Without this information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate.

If we were to make an assumption and use the witness's general accuracy of 80%, we could say that there's an 80% chance the attacker is actually black, given that the witness identified them as such. But this is an assumption and may not be an accurate reflection of the true probability.

Therefore, the best answer in the given format would be:
{probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1 due to missing information.}
