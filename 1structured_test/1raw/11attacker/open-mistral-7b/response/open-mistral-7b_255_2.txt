Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if this identification was correct or an error.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This information might be relevant if we knew the location of the attack or if we could assume that the attacker was likely to be from the local population. But since we don't have that information, it seems irrelevant to our current estimation.

Given that we don't know if the witness's identification was correct or not, we can't make a definitive probability estimate. However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate is 20%, which means that in 2 out of 10 cases, they would incorrectly identify a white person as black. This suggests that without more information, it might be more probable that the attacker is white.

So, strictly speaking, without more information, it's not possible to provide a probability estimate that is both accurate and based on the available information.
