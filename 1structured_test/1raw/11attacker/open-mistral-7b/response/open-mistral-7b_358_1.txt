To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the overall composition of the population.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, and the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black as Q. We know that Q = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - Q = 0.8.

The probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is Q * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black:

P(B) = P(Witness correctly identifies black person) + P(Witness misidentifies white person as black)

P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1465

P(B) â‰ˆ 0.2665

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.2665 or 26.65%.
