Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, we must consider that the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as black. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black could be lower than 15%, given the witness's mistake.

The witness's error rate of 20% means that if the attacker were actually white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. In other words, if the attacker were white, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly label them as black.

Given this, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is:

1. The probability of the attacker being black (actual probability) * The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race
+ The probability of the attacker being white (actual probability) * The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race is 0.2 (20%).

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is:

0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, based on the witness's incorrect identification, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is approximately 29%. However, this estimate is likely an overestimate due to the witness's error. The actual probability is likely lower than 15%. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive estimate.

{probability: 0.29, please note that this is likely an overestimate due to the witness's error}
