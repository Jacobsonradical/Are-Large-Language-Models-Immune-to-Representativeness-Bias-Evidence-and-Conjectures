To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

Let's assign the following variables:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so 0.8)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the race 20% of the time, so 0.2)

Since the population is half white and half black, the probability of the attacker being white is P(~A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.19425
P(B) = 0.31425

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.31425
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.218

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.218, or 21.8%.
