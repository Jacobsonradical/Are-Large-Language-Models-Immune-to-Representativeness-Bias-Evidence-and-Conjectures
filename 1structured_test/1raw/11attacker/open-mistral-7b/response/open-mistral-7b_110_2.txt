To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have information about the race of the attacker, we can treat each incorrect identification as an error in either direction.

The city has an 85% white population and a 15% black population. If we assume that the witness's error rate is equally distributed between the two races, then for every 100 people they encounter, they will correctly identify 80 white people and 20 black people. However, they will also incorrectly identify 20 white people as black and 8 black people as white.

So, in total, the witness will identify 100 white people + 20 mistakenly identified whites as black = 120 "white" people and 20 actual black people + 8 mistakenly identified blacks as white = 28 "black" people.

The probability that the witness will incorrectly identify a black person as white is therefore 8/28 = 0.286 (or 28.6%).

Since the witness also incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time, the probability that they will incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.20.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that they are actually white, is therefore 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that they are actually black, is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since we don't have any information about the actual race of the attacker, we need to consider both possibilities. The total probability that the attacker is black is therefore the sum of these two probabilities: 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 (or 29%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29} (or 29%).
