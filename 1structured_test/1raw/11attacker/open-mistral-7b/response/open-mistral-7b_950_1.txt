Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% white population, so 15% black population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

The probability of the evidence (P(E)) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given both hypotheses (attacker is black and attacker is white). Since the witness's accuracy is the same for both races, we can use the prior probabilities:

P(E) = P(E|H_black) * P(H_black) + P(E|H_white) * P(H_white)
          = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.8 * 0.85]
          = 0.12 + 0.68
          = 0.8

Now, we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
          = 0.15 / 1
          = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence and prior probabilities, is 0.15 or 15%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black and the accuracy of the witness in identifying race. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical estimate and actual probabilities may vary due to various factors.
