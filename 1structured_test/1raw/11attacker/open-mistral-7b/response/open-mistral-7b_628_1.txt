Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that a witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy rate).
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the person's race. This can be calculated as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black. From the witness's accuracy rate, we know that P(E|~H) is 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, the prior probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, so P(~H) = 0.85 and P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.17. Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.233.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (unknown) / 0.233

To find P(H), we can use Bayes' theorem again, but this time with the evidence being that 85% of the population is white, and the hypothesis being that the attacker is black. This gives:

P(H) = P(white population|H) * P(H) / P(white population) = (0.15) * P(H) / 0.85

Solving this equation for P(H) gives P(H) = 0.15 / 0.85 * P(H|white population), where P(H|white population) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the population is 85% white. This probability is unknown, but we can assume it to be some value less than 0.15, since it is unlikely that the attacker's race is independent of the population's race.

Assuming a conservative value of P(H|white population) = 0.1, we can find P(H):

P(H) = 0.15 / 0.85 * 0.1 = 0.0118

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8) * 0.0118 / 0.233 â‰ˆ 0.0394

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.0394, or 3.94%.
