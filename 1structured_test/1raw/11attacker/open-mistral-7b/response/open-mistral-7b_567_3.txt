Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black, which is an error in this context since we don't have enough information to confirm the attacker's race.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's errors are random and do not favor one race over the other (which is a strong assumption but let's proceed with it), then the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black would be the same as the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 20% * 85% = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 1 - the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white. This probability is 1 - 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.64 (or 64%).

So, based on the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.64} (or 64%).
