Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have direct evidence that the witness's identification is correct in this case.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's break this down:
- Event A: The attacker is black
- Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given the prior probability of event A (the attacker being black), which is 15% (from information b). We are also given the probability of event B given event A (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black), which is 0.8 (from information a).

However, we do not have direct information about the probability of event B given not event A (the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black). Since the witness errs 20% of the time (also from information a), we can assume that the probability of event B given not event A is 0.2.

We can now calculate the probability of event A given event B using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since we don't have P(B), we cannot directly calculate the probability. However, we can make an estimate by assuming that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.75, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate suggests that the attacker is likely black, but it's not a definitive proof due to the limitations of the information and assumptions.
