To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (this is given as 0.8 in the question)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (this is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (this is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are either white or black)

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(H), is not given in the question, so we can't directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence. However, we can calculate the ratio of P(H|E) to P(H|not E), where not E is the evidence that the attacker is not black.

Let's first calculate P(H|not E):

P(H|not E) = P(not E|H) * P(H) / P(not E)

We don't have the probability of not E given H, so we can't calculate this directly either. However, we do know that the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases, so we can assume that P(not E|H) is equal to 0.2.

We also know that P(E) is equal to P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H). Since we don't know the probability of E given not H, we can't calculate this directly either. However, we do know that P(not E|not H) is equal to 1 - P(E|not H), and since the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases, we can assume that P(E|not H) is equal to 0.2 as well. So, P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)).

We also know that the prior probability of the attacker being white, P(not H), is equal to 1 - P(H).

Now, we can calculate the ratio of P(H|E) to P(H|not E):

P(H|E) / P(H|not E) = P(E|H) / P(E|not H) * P(H) / P(not H) = (0.8) / (0.2) * P(H) / (1 - P(H))

We know that 85% of the population is white, so P(not H) = 0.15. We can set the ratio equal to the observed probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.8, and solve for P(H):

0.8 = (0.8) / (0.2) * P(H) / 0.15

P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15%. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate, and there is always some uncertainty involved. The actual probability could be slightly higher or lower than 15%.
