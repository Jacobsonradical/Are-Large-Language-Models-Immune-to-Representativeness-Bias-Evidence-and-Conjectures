To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the inherent error rate of the witness and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and not biased towards any particular race, then we can calculate the expected probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black and vice versa.

Let's call the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white Pw. Then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 1 - Pw, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, we can set up the following equation:

(1 - Pw) * 0.85 (probability of witnessing a white person) + 0.2 * Pw (probability of witnessing a black person and mistaking it for a white person) = 0.2

Solving this equation for Pw, we get Pw ≈ 0.517.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.15 * Pw = 0.15 * 0.517 ≈ 0.023 or 2.3%.

However, we should also consider the possibility of the witness's bias. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, there's a chance that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black and reported it as a black attacker. In this case, the actual probability of the attacker being black could be higher.

To account for this, let's assume that the witness's bias is such that they mistakenly identify a white person as black at twice the rate they mistakenly identify a black person as white. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is Pw' = 0.6 (since the witness is correct 60% of the time in such cases).

Then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 1 - Pw' = 0.4, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * (1 - Pw') = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08.

With this bias, we can set up a similar equation as before:

(1 - Pw') * 0.85 + 0.08 * 0.15 = 0.2

Solving this equation for Pw', we get Pw' ≈ 0.714.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement and this bias is approximately 0.15 * Pw' = 0.15 * 0.714 ≈ 0.022 or 2.2%.

However, this is still a significant underestimation of the actual probability of the attacker being black, as it assumes that the witness's bias is exactly twice as strong as it is in reality. In reality, the bias may be stronger or weaker, and it may also be biased towards one race or another.

Therefore, it is impossible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black without more information about the witness's bias and the actual racial composition of the attackers in the city. But based on the information provided, it is likely that the attacker is more likely to be white than black.
