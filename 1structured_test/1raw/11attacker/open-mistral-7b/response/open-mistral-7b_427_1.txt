Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The overall racial distribution of the city's population (85% white, 15% black).
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race (80% correct, 20% error).

The witness's statement suggests that they identified the attacker as black. However, we know that the witness is not infallible and makes errors 20% of the time. This means that there is a chance that the witness misidentified the attacker's race.

The probability that the attacker is actually black, given that the witness identified them as such, can be found by considering both the overall racial distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race is P(black) * 0.8 (given that the attacker is black, the witness gets it right 80% of the time). The probability that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified the attacker as black is P(not black) * 0.2 (given that the attacker is not black, the witness gets it wrong 20% of the time).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we know that the sum of these two probabilities must equal 1:

P(black) * 0.8 + P(not black) * 0.2 = 1

We can solve this equation for P(black):

P(black) = (1 - 0.2 * P(not black)) / 0.8

Given that 85% of the population is white, P(not black) would be 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being white). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P(black) = (1 - 0.2 * 0.15) / 0.8

Calculating the value, we find:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.6875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.6875 or 68.75%.
