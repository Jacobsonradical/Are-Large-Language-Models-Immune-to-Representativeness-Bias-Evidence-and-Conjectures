Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying races and a 20% error rate, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identifies a person as black

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is 100% or 1 (since they correctly identified the attacker as black)
2. P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, which is the weighted average of P(B|A) and P(B|not A).

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, which is 20% or 0.2 (since they err in 20% of their cases)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.15 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.32

Finally, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.46875 or 46.88%.
