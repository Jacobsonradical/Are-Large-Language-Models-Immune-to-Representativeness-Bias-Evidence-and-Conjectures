To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. We can do this using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identifies as black)

We know:
1. P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
2. P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the city's racial composition)
3. P(witness identifies as black) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)
   P(witness identifies as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
   P(witness identifies as black) ≈ 0.12

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 ≈ 0.667

So, based on the information provided, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 66.7%.
