Given the information provided, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability of the attacker being black, as the witness's ability to identify race was assessed under different conditions than the night of the attack. However, we can use the population statistics to make an educated guess.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. The witness's error rate is 20%, meaning they incorrectly identify a person's race 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness identifies the attacker as black, the chance that they are correct (the attacker is actually black) would be 1 - their error rate. So, the probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics would be approximately 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness also identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, this means there's a 20% chance that they made a mistake and the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification would be 0.15 * (1 - 0.20) = 0.11 (11%).

It's important to note that this is a simplified interpretation based on the given information and assumptions. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be other factors to consider, such as the potential influence of bias, the quality of the witness's description, and any other evidence available.
