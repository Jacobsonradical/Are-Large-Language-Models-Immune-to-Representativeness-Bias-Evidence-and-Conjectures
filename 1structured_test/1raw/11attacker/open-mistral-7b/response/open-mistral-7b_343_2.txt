To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% and their error rate is 20%.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means they made an error in this specific case. Since the error rate is 20%, the probability of making an error given a single observation is 0.2.

However, this does not directly give us the probability that the attacker is black because the witness's error does not account for the actual racial distribution in the city. To account for this, we need to consider the bias introduced by the witness's error.

Given that the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black than to incorrectly identify a black person as white (due to the population distribution), the bias in the witness's identification should shift the actual probability towards the white population.

The exact calculation of this bias is complex and requires knowledge of the specifics of the population distribution and the witness's error distribution. Without this information, a precise calculation is not possible.

However, we can make an approximate estimate by assuming that the bias is enough to offset the witness's error. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be approximately equal to the population proportion of blacks, which is 0.15 (15%).

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.15}
