To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (erring in identification). Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that a randomly selected person is black.

If we assume that the witness's erroneous identification is randomly distributed between white and black individuals, we can adjust the observed racial distribution based on the witness's error rate.

First, let's calculate the expected number of incorrect identifications for each race:

1. For white individuals: 85% x 20% = 0.17 (17%)
2. For black individuals: 15% x 80% = 0.12 (12%)

Now, let's adjust the observed racial distribution by subtracting the expected number of incorrect identifications:

1. Adjusted white population: 85% - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%)
2. Adjusted black population: 15% - 0.12 = 0.13 (13%)

Next, let's estimate the probability that the witness identifies a black individual as black. This probability is equal to the actual black population (0.13) divided by the adjusted racial distribution (0.83 white + 0.13 black = 0.96).

0.13 / 0.96 = 0.135 (13.5%)

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that the probability that the attacker is indeed black is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (80%).

But we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. We can do this by multiplying the witness's correct identification probability by the adjusted black population probability (0.80 x 0.135 = 0.108, or 10.8%).

Finally, we can adjust this estimate by considering the original racial distribution of the city. Since the actual black population is 0.15, we can divide our estimate by the ratio of the adjusted black population to the actual black population:

0.108 / (0.13 / 0.15) = 0.108 / 0.0867 â‰ˆ 0.124 (12.4%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, taking into account the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 12.4%.
