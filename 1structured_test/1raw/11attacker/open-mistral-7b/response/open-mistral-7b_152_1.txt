Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% when presented with a half-half mix of whites and blacks.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black and has an 80% accuracy rate, we can estimate that the attacker is indeed black with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
