To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is known to be 80% correct and 20% incorrect. This means that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the race, and in 20% of cases, the witness makes an error.

However, we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case. The only information we have is that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's reliability. This probability is simply the proportion of black people in the city.

So, without considering the witness's reliability, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, it's possible that the witness made an error in this specific case. To account for this possibility, we need to consider the witness's reliability.

We don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability that the witness made an error in this specific case, but we can calculate the probability that the witness made an error given that the attacker is black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the witness made an error given that the attacker is black is 0.20 (or 20%).

This means that if the attacker is indeed black, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error and identified someone else as black.

Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we can't directly apply this probability to our estimate. However, we can use it as a lower bound for the probability that the attacker is black.

In other words, the probability that the attacker is black is at least 0.15 (or 15%), and it could be higher if the witness made an error.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.15, lower bound: 0.15}
