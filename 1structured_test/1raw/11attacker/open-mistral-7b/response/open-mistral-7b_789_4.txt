To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correctly identifying race) and the error rate is 20% (incorrectly identifying race). Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of being correct is equal to the witness's reliability, and the probability of being incorrect is equal to the error rate.

The probability that the attacker is actually white, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the error rate (the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of randomly selecting a white person is 0.85, and the probability of randomly selecting a black person is 0.15.

If the witness's identification is incorrect, then the attacker is actually white (a false positive). The probability of a false positive is the error rate multiplied by the probability of randomly selecting a white person.

So, the probability of a false positive is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of a true positive (the attacker is actually black) is the reliability multiplied by the probability of randomly selecting a black person. So, the probability of a true positive is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a true positive, and the probability that the attacker is actually white is the probability of a false positive.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, and the probability that the attacker is white is 0.17.

However, since we are only interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we can simply provide the value 0.12 as an estimate.
