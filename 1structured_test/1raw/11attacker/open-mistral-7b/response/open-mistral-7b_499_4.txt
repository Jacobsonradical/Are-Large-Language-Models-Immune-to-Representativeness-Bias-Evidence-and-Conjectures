To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race, but errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Given these facts, let's analyze the situation:

The witness said they saw a black attacker, but since we cannot rely on their 20% error rate, we should consider both possibilities: the witness correctly identified the attacker as black and the witness made an error.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given the witness's statement, we can write the following equation:

P(black) + P(white) = 1

We also know that the witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race is:

P(black|witness) = 0.8

Since the city's population is 85% white, we can write the following equation:

P(witness|black) = 0.8

Now, let's consider the two possibilities:

Case 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker as black.
In this case, P(black) = P(witness|black) = 0.8

Case 2: The witness made an error and the attacker is white.
In this case, the probability of this happening is given by the witness's error rate: P(white) = 1 - P(black) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness's statement in each case:

P(witness|black) = 0.8
P(witness|white) = 0.2 * P(black) / P(white) = 0.2 * 0.8 / 0.2 = 0.8

Since both cases are equally likely, we take the average of these probabilities:

P(witness) = 0.5 * P(witness|black) + 0.5 * P(witness|white) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.8

Now, we can solve for P(black) in the first equation:

P(black) = 1 - P(white) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
