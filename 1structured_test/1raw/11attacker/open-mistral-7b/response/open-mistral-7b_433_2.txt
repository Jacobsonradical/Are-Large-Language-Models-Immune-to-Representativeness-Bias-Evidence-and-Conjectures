To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually white (given the witness's error rate).

However, we also need to account for the racial demographics of the city. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white), which is approximately 0.15.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.
