Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, we don't have specific information about the attacker. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this as a successful identification by the witness.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. We can't directly apply this population distribution to the attacker because the witness's identification might not be representative of the actual race of the attacker.

However, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's race identification. Given that the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, we can consider this as an 80% likelihood that the actual attacker is black.

So, the probability estimate that the attacker is black would be: {probability: 0.8}
