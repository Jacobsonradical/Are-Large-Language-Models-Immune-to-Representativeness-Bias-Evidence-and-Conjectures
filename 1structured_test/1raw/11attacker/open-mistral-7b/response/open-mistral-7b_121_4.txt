Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. If we interpret this as a conditional probability, it means that when the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify it as black 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify it as black 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given the racial demographics of the city (85% white and 15% black), the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The witness's statement that they identified the attacker as black has a probability of being correct if the attacker is actually black and a probability of being incorrect if the attacker is white. The probability of the witness's statement being correct is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness's statement being incorrect is the product of the probability that the attacker is white and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness's statement cannot be both correct and incorrect, the sum of these probabilities must equal 1. Therefore, the probability that the witness's statement is correct (the attacker is black) is 0.12, and the probability that the witness's statement is incorrect (the attacker is white) is 0.88.

However, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black, not the probability of the witness's statement being correct. Therefore, we need to adjust our estimate to account for the witness's statement being incorrect.

Given that the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect is 0.88, the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness's statement is incorrect, is the proportion of black people among the white people that the witness mistakenly identifies as black. Since the witness makes this mistake 20% of the time, the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness's statement is incorrect, is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The total probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness's statement being correct (0.12) plus the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness's statement is incorrect (0.17). Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29} (29%).
