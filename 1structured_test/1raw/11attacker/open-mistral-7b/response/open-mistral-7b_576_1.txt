To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness sees a white person is 0.85.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black, given the racial composition of the city.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the racial composition of the city, is 0.15 (15%). So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the attacker being black is 0.83 * 0.15 = 0.1245 (12.45%).

However, we know that the witness made an identification, which means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than the 12.45% calculated above. Since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 17% of the time, we need to add this error to the 12.45% calculated above:

Probability of the attacker being black = 0.1245 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.23 (23%)

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.23 (23%).
