To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's reliability in identifying race and the demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that when the actual race is black, the witness will correctly identify it as black 80% of the time.

However, we don't know the actual race of the attacker, so we need to consider the likelihood of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying this, as well as the likelihood of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying this.

The probability of the attacker being black is 15% (given in point b). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (from point a).

The probability of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying this is the probability of the attacker being white (0.85 from point b) multiplied by the probability of the witness erring (0.2 from point a).

So, the probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying this, plus the probability of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying this, adds up to the total probability.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
