To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution in the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, we would initially expect the attacker to be white, given the majority population. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black introduces another factor.

The witness identified the race correctly 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this is an instance where the witness was correct. Therefore, we need to consider the probability of this event occurring given the witness's reliability.

Assuming that the racial distribution is independent of the witness's identification, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as follows:

1. The probability of the attacker being black is 15%.
2. Given that the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%).

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, this does not take into account the fact that the witness also mistakenly identifies white attackers as black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the proportion of those mistakes that correspond to misidentifying white attackers as black is 20% * 0.85 (the proportion of whites).

This means that the probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.17 (17%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness made a mistake and misidentified a white attacker as black is 0.17, and the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker is 0.12.

Since the probability of these two events is additive, we can calculate the total probability of the witness's identification by adding these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

Therefore, given the racial distribution in the city and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 (29%). This is significantly lower than the racial distribution in the city, suggesting that the witness's identification may not accurately reflect the actual race of the attacker.
