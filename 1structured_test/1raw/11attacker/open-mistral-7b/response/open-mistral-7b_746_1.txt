Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not always accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black. However, the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1, where P(W) is the probability that the attacker is white.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white is 0.2 * P(W).

However, the witness also correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time, which implies that the attacker is black 80% of the time when the witness makes a correct identification. So, the probability that the attacker is black given a correct identification by the witness is 0.8.

Given that the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify the attacker's race 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

So, we can write an equation: 0.8 * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * P(W)

Solving this equation, we get P(B) ≈ 0.16 and P(W) ≈ 0.84.

However, we should be cautious about interpreting this result too strictly, as it assumes that the witness's error rate is constant and independent of the actual race of the person. In reality, error rates may vary based on factors such as lighting, distance, and individual biases.

Therefore, while the estimate of P(B) = 0.16 suggests a higher probability of the attacker being black than the city's population statistics, it should be viewed as an approximation rather than a definitive answer.
