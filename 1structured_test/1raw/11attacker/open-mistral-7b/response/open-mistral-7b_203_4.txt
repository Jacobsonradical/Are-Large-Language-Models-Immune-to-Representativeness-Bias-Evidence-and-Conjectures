Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black, which means they either correctly identified the attacker's race or made an error. Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we can't definitively say the attacker is black. However, we do know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a black person in the population.

Here's how we can calculate this:

1. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time.
2. The population is 85% white and 15% black.
3. To find out how many times the witness correctly identifies a black person in the population, we multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person by the proportion of black people in the population: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%.

{probability: 0.12}
