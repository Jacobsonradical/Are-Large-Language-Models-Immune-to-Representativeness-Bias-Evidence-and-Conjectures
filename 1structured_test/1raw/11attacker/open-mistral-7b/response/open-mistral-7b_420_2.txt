To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In this case, let:
- A be the event that the attacker is black.
- B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't have enough information to directly estimate, so we'll assume an initial guess).
- P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (given in the text as 0.8).
- P(B|¬A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (given in the text as 0.2).
- P(A|B) is what we want to find (probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black (which we can calculate using the population statistics given in the text).

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since we don't know P(A), we can't calculate P(B) directly. However, we do know P(B|A) and P(B|¬A), as well as the total population distribution given in the text:

- P(A) ≈ 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black)
- P(¬A) ≈ 0.85

Using this information, we can calculate P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from the text).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

However, since we can't directly calculate P(B), we can't directly calculate P(A|B) either. Instead, we can rewrite the equation to express P(A|B) in terms of known quantities:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimate of P(A|B) ≈ 0.3415 or 34.15%.

So, based on the witness's statement and the given information, there is approximately a 34.15% chance that the attacker is black. Keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the given assumptions and approximations, and the actual probability could be different if more information were available.
