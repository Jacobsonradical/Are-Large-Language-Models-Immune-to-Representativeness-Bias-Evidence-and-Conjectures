Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's observation).

Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (or 0.15)
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2 (20%).
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is given as 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
