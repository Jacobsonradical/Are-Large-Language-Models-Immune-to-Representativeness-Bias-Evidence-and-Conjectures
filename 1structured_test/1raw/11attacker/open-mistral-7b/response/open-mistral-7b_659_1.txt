Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given that the witness made an identification, we can't directly use their error rate of 20%. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A) = 15% (probability of the attacker being black)
P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black in this case)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we don't have information about P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is not black), we cannot directly calculate P(B). However, we can still estimate P(A|B) using the information we have.

Since the witness identifies the race correctly 80% of the time, we can assume that P(B|A) is approximately 0.8. And since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that P(B|not A) is approximately 0.2.

We can then calculate an approximate value for P(B) by multiplying P(B|A) by P(A) and P(B|not A) by P(not A) and summing these two probabilities:

P(B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.19

Now, we can estimate P(A|B) by dividing P(B|A) by P(B):

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 0.19 ≈ 0.421

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.42 or 42%.
