To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's assume that the attack occurred at a random location in the city, and the attacker's race was randomly selected from the city's population. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker's race was not 100% accurate. The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black when the attacker was actually white. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black, considering the witness's error rate, is lower than 0.15.

To calculate this probability, we can multiply the true probability of the attacker being black (0.15) by the probability that the witness did not make an error (1 - 0.20 = 0.80).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's error rate, is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12, or 12%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, is 0.12.
