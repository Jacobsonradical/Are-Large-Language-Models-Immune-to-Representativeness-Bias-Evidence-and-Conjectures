To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (total probability of witness identifying a black person)

First, let's calculate P(E|H):

P(E|H) = Witness's accuracy in identifying black people
         = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H):

P(H) = Probability of attacker being black in the city
     = 0.15 (from information 'a')

Now, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
     = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
        â‰ˆ 0.3103

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
