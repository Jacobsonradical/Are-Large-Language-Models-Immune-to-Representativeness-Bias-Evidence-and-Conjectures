To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85 and the probability of seeing a black person is 0.15.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). The probability that the witness misidentifies a white person as black is therefore 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Given the witness's statement, we can conclude that the probability of the attacker being black is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as the attacker, which is 0.12.
