To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying race is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
2. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could be either correct or incorrect. Since we don't know if the witness was correct, we'll consider both possibilities.

If the witness was incorrect, they would have identified a white person as black, which is a false positive. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of a false positive is 0.2.

However, if the witness was correct, the attacker is indeed black. Since the city's population is 15% black, the probability of a black person being in the attacker's position is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is the sum of the probabilities of both correct and incorrect identifications weighted by their respective outcomes:

probability = probability_of_correct_identification * probability_of_black_attacker_given_correct_identification + probability_of_incorrect_identification * probability_of_black_attacker_given_incorrect_identification

We know the probability of a correct identification is 0.8, and the probability of a black attacker given a correct identification is 1 (since the attacker is actually black).

The probability of a black attacker given an incorrect identification is zero, as the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is:

probability = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
