Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence B is the witness's identification.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we don't have directly but can estimate from the city's demographics. From information b, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8.

3. P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

4. P(B) is the total probability of the witness making the identification, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.13

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.13 or 13%. This is lower than the city's demographic percentage of black population, likely due to the witness's error rate.
