In this scenario, we have two sources of information: the demographic data of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify races.

1. From the demographic data, we know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness, in general, correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, in this specific case, the witness identified the attacker as black.

The question does not provide any information about whether the witness made a correct identification or an error in this case. Therefore, we cannot directly use the witness's success rate to estimate the attacker's race.

The only information we can use is the demographic data of the city. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is 15%.

However, since we cannot discount the possibility of a witness error, it might be reasonable to consider that there is a small chance the attacker could be white, even though it is less likely according to the demographic data. Without more information, it is challenging to quantify this chance accurately.

In summary, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker is black is 15%. However, this probability might be affected by the possibility of a witness error, which is not quantifiable with the given data.

{probability: 0.15, please note that this estimate considers only the demographic data and does not account for the possibility of a witness error}
