The information provided suggests that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is generally accurate in identifying race 80% of the time identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black if the attacker was indeed black is 0.8 (from information b). If the attacker was white, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black is 0.5 (given that half the population is white).

Since we do not know the attacker's race, we can calculate the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is black, and the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is white. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black.

The probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (from information b).
The probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is white is 0.5.

The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (from information a).
The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / (P(Witness statement | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness statement | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white))

Calculating:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85))

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) â‰ˆ 0.1935

Therefore, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 19.35%.
