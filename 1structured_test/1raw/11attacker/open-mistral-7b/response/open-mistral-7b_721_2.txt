Based on the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The reliability of this witness's racial identification is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any information about the racial makeup of the group of people the witness was judging from, it's not possible to directly apply their error rate to the population statistics. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we're trying to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the witness's reliability (0.8).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the racial composition of the city (0.15 for black).
- P(B) is the probability of B, which is the likelihood of the witness's statement given any race, and is equal to P(B|black) * P(black) + P(B|white) * P(white). Since we only have information for P(B|black), we can assume P(B|white) = 0 (the witness never mistakenly identifies a white person as black).

Given this, we can compute P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|black) * P(black) + P(B|white) * P(white) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.667

So, based on the information provided and applying Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.667 or 66.7%.
