To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker's race, which we denote as A (A = black or A = white). We have two pieces of evidence:

1. The population demographics of the city (P(A = black) = 0.15, P(A = white) = 0.85).
2. The witness's identification of the attacker as black (E = witness identified black).

According to the witness, the attacker is black. However, we know that the witness is not perfect in identifying races and makes errors 20% of the time. So, there's a chance that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black.

To account for this possibility, we need to calculate the probability P(E | A = black) and P(E | A = white). We are given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so P(E | A = black) = 0.8. Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, P(E | A = white) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A = black | E) = [P(E | A = black) * P(A = black)] / [P(E | A = black) * P(A = black) + P(E | A = white) * P(A = white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A = black | E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.234 (23.4%).

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.234}
