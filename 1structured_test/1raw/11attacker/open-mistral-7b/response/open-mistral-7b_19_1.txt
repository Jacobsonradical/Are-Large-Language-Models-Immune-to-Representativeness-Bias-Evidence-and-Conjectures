To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. In this case, even if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as black.
3. On the other hand, since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, there is a higher probability that the attacker is white (0.85).
4. However, the witness identified the attacker as black.
5. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black (0.15) plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.2) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being white (0.85).

Using the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

probability = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.3 or 30%.
