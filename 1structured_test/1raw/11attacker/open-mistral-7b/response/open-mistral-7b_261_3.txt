To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness sees a white person is 0.85. This means that the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness sees a black person is 0.15. Given the witness's reliability, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.80, and the probability that they incorrectly identify a black person as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03, or 3%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person, which is 0.80.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.80}.
