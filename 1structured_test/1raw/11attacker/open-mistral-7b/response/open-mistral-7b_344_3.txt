Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (85% white), which we can denote as P(A=black). The likelihood of the witness making the identification given that the attacker is black is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time), which we can denote as P(witness_identification|A=black).

The likelihood of the witness making the identification given that the attacker is white is given as 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time), which we can denote as P(witness_identification|A=white).

To find the posterior probability, we use Bayes' theorem:

P(A=black|witness_identification) = P(witness_identification|A=black) * P(A=black) / [P(witness_identification|A=black) * P(A=black) + P(witness_identification|A=white) * P(A=white)]

Substituting the values:

P(A=black|witness_identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the value:

P(A=black|witness_identification) â‰ˆ 0.286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 28.6%.
