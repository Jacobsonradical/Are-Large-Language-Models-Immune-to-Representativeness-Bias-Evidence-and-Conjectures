Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
3. We cannot assume that the attacker is more likely to be mistakenly identified as black (or white) due to the witness's bias. So, we can assume that the witness's error rate applies equally to both races.
4. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is the witness's true positive rate (TP rate) for identifying blacks, which is 0.8 (80%) times the proportion of blacks in the population, which is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability estimate is: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

In simpler terms, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification and the city's population demographics.
