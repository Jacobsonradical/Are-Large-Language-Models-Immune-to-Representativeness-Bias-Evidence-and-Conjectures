To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black when they are actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness makes the identification)

We are given P(B|A) and P(A), so we can calculate P(A|B).

Given the information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the attacker is white. Since 85% of the population is white, P(B) is the complement of P(A):

P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.176

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 17.6%.
