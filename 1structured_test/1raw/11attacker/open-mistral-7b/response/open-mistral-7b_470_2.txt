Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not clearly visible and the witness identified them as black, there is a 0.8 probability that the attacker is indeed black, assuming the witness's racial identification is a reliable indicator in this situation.

However, we also have additional information about the racial demographics of the city, which is that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This information might influence our estimate, but it's important to note that the witness's identification is not necessarily a reflection of the city's racial distribution. Therefore, while considering the city's demographics, it's still reasonable to assume a 0.8 probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, assuming the witness's racial identification is a reliable indicator in this situation.
