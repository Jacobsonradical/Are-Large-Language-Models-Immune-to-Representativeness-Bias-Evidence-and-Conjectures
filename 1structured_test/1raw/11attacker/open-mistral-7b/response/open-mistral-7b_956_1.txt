Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately identify race is only 80% accurate, with a 20% error rate.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that when they correctly identify someone as black, there is a 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 probability that they are correct (since 15% of the population is black). On the other hand, when the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black, there is a 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 probability that they are actually mistaken (since 85% of the population is white).

So, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's identification and error rate, is {probability: 0.29}.
