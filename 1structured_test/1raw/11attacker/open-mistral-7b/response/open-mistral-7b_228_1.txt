Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly use the witness's reliability. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, and P(B) is the likelihood of the witness making this statement.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's race, we don't have a prior probability (P(A)). We can estimate it based on the city's population, but this estimation may not be accurate because the attack could have happened anywhere in the city, not just in areas with the city's average population distribution.

However, we do have the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (P(B|A)) and the probability of the witness making this statement (P(B)) from the information given.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the information)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (calculated by multiplying the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black and the probability of the attacker being black, and also multiplying the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is black and the probability of the attacker being white)

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.75

So, based on the witness's statement and the city's population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.75 or 75%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's reliability in identifying race is the same in all conditions, which may not be the case.
