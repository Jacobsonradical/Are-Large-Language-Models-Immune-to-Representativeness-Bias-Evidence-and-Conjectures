Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

Let's break down the variables in this context:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time, where ~A represents that the attacker is not black)

The prior probability of event B (B: witness identification) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (P(B|A)) and the probabilities of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black attacker (P(B|~A)). Since the population is 50% white and 50% black, the prior probability of witnessing a black attacker and a non-black attacker are both 0.5. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%. This estimate takes into account both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.
