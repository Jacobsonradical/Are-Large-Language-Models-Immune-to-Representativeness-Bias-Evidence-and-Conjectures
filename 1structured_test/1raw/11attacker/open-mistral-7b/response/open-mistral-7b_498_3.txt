Based on the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

When making an estimate, we should weight the witness's identification by their reliability and the population distribution. Let's denote W as the witness's reliability (0.8) and P as the population distribution (0.15 for black people).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, can be estimated as:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = W * P + (1 - W) * (1 - P)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.12 + 0.06

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.18

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information, is 0.18.
