Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate is given for an equal distribution of races (50% white and 50% black). In the actual city, the distribution is not equal: 85% white and 15% black. This means that the witness's error rate for this specific city might be different.

Unfortunately, the information given does not allow us to calculate an exact probability for the attacker being black based on the witness's error rate in this specific city. We would need more information, such as the witness's error rate when identifying races in a city with a racial distribution similar to the one we have.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical answer in the requested format. I recommend further investigation or consultation with a statistician to gather more data and accurately estimate the probability.
