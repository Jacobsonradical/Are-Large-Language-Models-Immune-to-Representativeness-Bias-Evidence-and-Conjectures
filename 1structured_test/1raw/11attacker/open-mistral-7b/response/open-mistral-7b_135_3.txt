Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is:

{probability: 0.68}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is only 80% under similar conditions, meaning they make errors 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black, but we cannot be 100% confident that the witness's identification is accurate due to their error rate.
4. To account for the witness's potential error, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly (80%) times the actual proportion of black people in the city (15%), and then subtract that from 1 to account for the probability of the witness making an error.
5. This calculation results in a probability estimate of approximately 0.68 for the attacker being black.
