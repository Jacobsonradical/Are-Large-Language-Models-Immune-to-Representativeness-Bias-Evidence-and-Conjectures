To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event given new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Here, P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B, P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A, P(A) is the prior probability of event A, and P(B) is the probability of event B.

In our case, A is the event "attacker is black", B is the event "witness says attacker is black", P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, and P(B) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is black, which is a combination of P(B|A) and the probability of the attacker being white.

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = unknown (prior probability of the attacker being black)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and since there are more whites than blacks, this implies that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white only 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 times)
4. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

To find P(A), we can solve for it in the equation for P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 * (1 - P(A))

Since 85% of the population is white (P(not A) = 0.15), we can rewrite the equation for P(B) as:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 * 0.85

Now we have two equations with two unknowns, P(A) and P(B). However, we only have one piece of information that relates to P(B), which is that 85% of the population is white. Without more information, we cannot solve these equations directly.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the information given. Since the witness's accuracy is relatively high and the population is heavily skewed towards white, it seems unlikely that the attacker is black. Therefore, our estimate for P(A) will be on the lower end.

So, our estimate: {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's accuracy and the population statistics are representative of the situation. If the witness's accuracy or the population statistics are not representative, then our estimate may be inaccurate.
