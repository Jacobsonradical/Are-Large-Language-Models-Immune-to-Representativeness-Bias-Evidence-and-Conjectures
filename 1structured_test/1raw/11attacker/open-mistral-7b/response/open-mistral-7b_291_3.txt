To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the initial population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The initial probability of an attacker being black is 15% (since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black).

2. However, the witness's testimony increases the likelihood of the attacker being black. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error.

3. Therefore, the probability that the witness accurately identified the attacker's race as black is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

4. However, we must consider that the witness's testimony places a higher likelihood on black attackers than the initial probability, which is 15%. So, the final probability of the attacker being black should be the product of the initial probability and the probability that the witness made a correct identification.

5. The final probability is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (12%).
