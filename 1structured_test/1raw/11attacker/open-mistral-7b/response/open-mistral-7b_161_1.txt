Given the two pieces of information provided, we have a population distribution of 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness has identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's mistake was in this case, we'll assume an equal likelihood of error for both racial categories.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white). Since the population distribution tells us that 85% of the population is white, we can write this as P(white) = 0.85.

Given the witness's error rate, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake when identifying a white person as P(error|white) = 0.20. Similarly, the probability of the witness not making a mistake when identifying a black person is P(correct|black) = 0.80.

The witness has identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was indeed white, the witness would have made an error. The probability of this happening is P(error|white) = 0.20. On the other hand, if the attacker was black, the witness would not have made an error, and the probability of this happening is P(correct|black) = 0.80.

Since we don't know which case applies, we can calculate the probability of the witness's statement given both possibilities:

P(witness statement|attacker is black) = P(correct|black) = 0.80
P(witness statement|attacker is white) = P(error|white) = 0.20

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is:

P(attacker is black|witness statement) = P(witness statement|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / (P(witness statement|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness statement|attacker is white) * P(attacker is white))

Substituting the numbers, we get:

P(attacker is black|witness statement) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.26.

So, the estimate is: {probability: 0.26}
