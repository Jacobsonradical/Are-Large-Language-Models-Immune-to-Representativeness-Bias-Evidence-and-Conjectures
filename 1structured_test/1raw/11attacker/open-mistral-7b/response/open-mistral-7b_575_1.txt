To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 20%, and mistakenly identifies a black person as white with the same probability. Since there are equal numbers of whites and blacks, the probability of picking a white person is also 50%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him. The probability of this happening is P(black).

2) The attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black. The probability of this happening is the probability of picking a white person times the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

Since the witness's identification is either correct or a mistake, these two scenarios add up to 100%. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, P(black), is given by the following equation:

P(black) = Probability of correct identification * Probability of attacker being black
          = 0.8 * P(black)
          = 0.8 * (P(black) + P(not black))
          = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.8 * (1 - P(black))

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 0.2/0.8:

P(black) = 0.2 * (0.8 * P(black) + 0.8 * (1 - P(black)))

Now we have a quadratic equation:

0.04P(black)^2 - 0.04P(black) + 0.03P(black) = 0

Solving this equation, we find that P(black) â‰ˆ 0.59 or 59%.

However, the racial composition of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, which suggests a lower probability for the attacker being black. In this case, the witness's error rate might be higher than assumed, or the witness might have been influenced by biases. Without more information, it's difficult to accurately estimate the probability based solely on the given data.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's identification and the city's racial demographics, is approximately 59%, but this estimate could be affected by various factors. {probability: 0.59}
