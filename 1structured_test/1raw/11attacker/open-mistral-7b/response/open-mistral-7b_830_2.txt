Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness's correct identification rate is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that if the attacker is actually white (P(white) = 1 - P(black)), the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black with probability 0.2, and if the attacker is actually black, the witness will correctly identify him with probability 0.8.

The observed probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is given by P(witness says black) = 0.8P(black) + 0.2(1 - P(black)).

The witness identified the attacker as black. So, we have an equation: 0.8P(black) + 0.2(1 - P(black)) = 1.

Solving this equation gives us P(black) â‰ˆ 0.75.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.75}.
