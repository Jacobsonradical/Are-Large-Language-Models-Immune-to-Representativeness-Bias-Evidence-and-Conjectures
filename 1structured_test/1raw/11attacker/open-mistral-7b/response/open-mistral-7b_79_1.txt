To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's observations and the racial composition of the population.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, since we don't know if the witness made a correct or incorrect identification in this specific case, we can't use their raw percentage directly.

We can instead use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, times the prior probability of event A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. The prior probability of event A (P(A)) is the proportion of blacks in the population, which we know is 15%.

The likelihood of event B given event A (P(B|A)) is the witness's reliability, which is 0.8. The likelihood of event B given not event A (P(B|not A)) is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.57, or 57%.

Therefore, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 57%.
