Given the information provided, it's important to note that the victim's inability to see the attacker's race makes their identification irrelevant to this question. Our focus should be on the reliability of the witness's race identification.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races (which is not necessarily the case but is a common assumption in probability problems), then the witness's erroneous identification of a white person as black would occur 20% of the time.

However, since 85% of the population is white, the total number of times the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%. This leaves 20% - 17% = 3% of the witness's errors to be incorrect identifications of black people as white.

So, if the witness identifies a person as black, there's a 80% chance that they're correct, and a 3% chance that they're making an error. Adding these probabilities gives us an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified someone as black: 0.8 + 0.03 = {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.

However, as mentioned earlier, this estimate assumes that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races, which may not be the case. A more accurate estimate would require additional information or a more complex modeling approach.
