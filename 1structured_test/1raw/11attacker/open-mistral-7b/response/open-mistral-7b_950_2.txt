Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black with an accuracy of 80% in similar conditions. This means that the witness misidentified the race 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there is a 20% chance that the actual attacker was white.
4. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (80%) and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black (20% due to the witness's error rate).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%) + 0.2 * 0.15 (20% chance of misidentifying a white attacker as black), which equals 0.84 or 84%.
