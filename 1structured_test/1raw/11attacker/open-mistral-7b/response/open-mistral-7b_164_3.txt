To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black (given by information "a" in the problem statement)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given by information "b" in the problem statement)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (also given by information "b" in the problem statement)
- P(B|W) is what we want to find, the probability of an attacker being black given that the witness identified someone as black

We can write Bayes' theorem as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Using the given information, we can calculate the values for P(W|B), P(W|~B), P(B), and P(~B), and then substitute them into Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W).

P(W|B) = 0.8 (given in information "b")
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (calculated as 1 - P(W|B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
P(B) = 0.15 (given in information "a")
P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (given in information "a")

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%.
