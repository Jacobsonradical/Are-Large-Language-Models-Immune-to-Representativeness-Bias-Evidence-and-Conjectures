To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observed evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the observed evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the witness's statement)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness makes the statement, which in this case is the same as the probability that the attacker is black or not black, since the witness does not know the attacker's race)

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, since 15% of the population is black)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
          = 0.12 + 0.17
          = 0.29

Where A^c is the complement of A (the event that the attacker is not black).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
            = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
            = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the witness's statement and the prior knowledge of the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
