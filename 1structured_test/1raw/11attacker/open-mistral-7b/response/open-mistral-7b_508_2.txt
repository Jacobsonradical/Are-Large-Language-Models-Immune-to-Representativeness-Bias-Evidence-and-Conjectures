Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's define our events:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(A): This is the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15%. So, P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A): This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is given as 0.8. So, P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A): This is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate this probability as follows:
  P(B|~A) = P(~A) * P(witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
  P(~A) = 0.85 (since 15% of the population is black)
  So, P(B|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
- P(B): This is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A):
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1965

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified someone as black:
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
  P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.1965 â‰ˆ 0.354

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.354, or 35.4%.
