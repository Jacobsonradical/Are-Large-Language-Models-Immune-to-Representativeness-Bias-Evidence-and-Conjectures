Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the attack happened at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's race. This means that the witness's ability to accurately identify the race of the attacker is not applicable in this case.

Therefore, based on the city's demographics alone, the probability of the attacker being black would be 15%, as that is the percentage of the city's population that is black.

{probability: 0.15}
