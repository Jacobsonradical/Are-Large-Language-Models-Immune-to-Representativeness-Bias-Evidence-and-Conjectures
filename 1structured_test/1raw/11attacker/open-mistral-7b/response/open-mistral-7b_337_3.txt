Given the information provided, the population distribution is 85% white and 15% black. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as black.

Since the witness had a lower success rate in identifying race than the actual population distribution, we would expect them to misidentify more often than not, especially considering they couldn't see the attacker's face well.

So, even though the witness identified the attacker as black, it doesn't necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. In fact, given the witness's error rate, we might expect them to mistakenly identify a white person as black more often than they do.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification alone, it would be more reasonable to assume that the attacker is white, given the city's population distribution. However, it's important to note that this is not definitive evidence and other factors should also be considered.

In terms of strict numbers, without more information, we cannot provide a probability estimate. The witness's identification is not enough to reliably infer the attacker's race.
