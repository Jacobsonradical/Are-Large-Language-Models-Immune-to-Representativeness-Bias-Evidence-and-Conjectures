Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means they made a correct identification or an error. Since we don't know whether this was a correct identification or an error, we can't directly use the witness's success rate.

However, we can use the population distribution to make an estimate. If the attacker was white (which makes up 85% of the population), then the witness would have been correct 85% of the time, and if the attacker was black (making up 15% of the population), the witness would have been correct 15% of the time (since they were wrong 85% of the time when they saw whites).

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means they were either correct or wrong. Since they were correct more often than they would have been if the attacker was white, it's more likely that the attacker was black.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black, which is 15%.

However, since the witness's success rate is higher than this, it suggests that the witness is more likely to identify a black person as black than a white person as black, which seems unlikely. This could mean that the witness was not being completely truthful, or that there is some other factor at play that we are not aware of.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The information about the witness's success rate is not consistent with the population distribution, and without more information, it's impossible to say whether the witness was telling the truth or not.

{probability: 0.15, but this estimate is likely to be unreliable due to inconsistencies in the information}
