Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given observed evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the witness's identification)
- P(B) is the probability of observing B (the witness's identification)

We are given the following values:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker being black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (the probability of the witness making that identification, considering both the attacker being black and the attacker not being black)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / [0.29] â‰ˆ 0.517

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.517 or 51.7%.
