To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate, meaning they make errors 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. This happens with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This happens with a probability of 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (15% white population times 20% error rate).

So, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
