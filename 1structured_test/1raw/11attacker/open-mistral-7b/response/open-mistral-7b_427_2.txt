To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given this information, let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is black. In this case, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly is 0.8 (80%).

Scenario 2: The attacker is white. In this case, the witness is likely to mistake the attacker for black due to their error rate of 0.2 (20%).

The probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black is 0.2 * 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white). This means that the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.17 (17%).

The probability that the witness identifies a black person as white, given that the person is indeed black, is 0.2 * 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black). This means that the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white is 0.03 (3%).

The witness identified the attacker as black. Since the witness errs more often in identifying white people as black than black people as white, it is more likely that the attacker is indeed black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 (80%) + 0.03 (3%) = 0.83 (83%).

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on assumptions about the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city. In a real-world scenario, it would be necessary to gather more specific and reliable information to make a more accurate estimate.
