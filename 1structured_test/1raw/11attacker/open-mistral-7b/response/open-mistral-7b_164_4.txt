Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city where the attack occurred, with 85% white and 15% black population.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

The witness's statement that the attacker was black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There's a possibility that the witness made an error in their identification.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event A given another event B, based on the prior probabilities of A and B and the likelihood of A given B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

The prior probability of event A is the probability that the attacker is black in the city's population, which is 15% (0.15).

The likelihood of event A given event B is the witness's error rate when identifying a black person as white, which is 20% (0.2).

The prior probability of event B is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is the witness's success rate when identifying a black person, which is 80% (0.8).

The likelihood of event B given event A is the witness's success rate when identifying a black person as black, which is also 80% (0.8).

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of event A given event B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

This means that, given the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city, it is estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of 12%. This is a significantly lower probability than the 15% racial demographic of black people in the city, suggesting that the witness's identification may not be reliable in this case.
