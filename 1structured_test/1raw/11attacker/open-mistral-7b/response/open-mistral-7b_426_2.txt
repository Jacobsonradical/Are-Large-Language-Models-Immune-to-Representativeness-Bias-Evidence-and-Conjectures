To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black," and we want to find P(A|B).

1. We are given the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (from information b). So, P(A) = 0.15.

2. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is the accuracy rate of the witness when judging race, which is 80% (from information a). So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is the error rate of the witness, which is 20% (from information a). So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

4. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (from information b). So, P(not A) = 0.85.

5. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is equal to the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26.

6. Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.577.

So, based on the witness's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 57.7%.
