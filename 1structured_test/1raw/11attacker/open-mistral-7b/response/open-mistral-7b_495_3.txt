To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is not black)
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified a black person

From the provided information, we know the following:

1. P(A) = probability of attacker being black
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)
4. P(A) + P(~A) = 1 (since the attacker is either black or not black)

The value of P(~A) = 1 - P(A) is given by the condition that P(A) + P(~A) = 1.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)].

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

From the second piece of information, we know that P(~A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.17

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.17 or 17%.
