Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any direct information about how often the witness's error corresponds to misidentifying a black person as white.

Assuming that the witness's mistakes are equally likely to be errors in either direction (overestimating or underestimating the proportion of black people), we can calculate the probability of a false positive (misidentifying a white person as black) as 20% / 2 = 10%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as follows:

Probability of witness identifying a black person as black = Proportion of black people x Witness's accuracy in identifying black people
                                                                            = 0.15 x 0.8
                                                                            = 0.12

However, we also need to account for the possibility of false positives. The probability of a false positive is 10%, so we can calculate the probability of a false positive occurring and the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

Probability of false positive = 0.1 x 0.2 = 0.02

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black and then reporting that the attacker is black is 0.02.

Therefore, the total probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (either correctly or due to a false positive) is:

Probability of witness identifying attacker as black = 0.12 + 0.02
                                                                           = 0.14

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14%.
