Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as the product of the likelihood of event B given event A (P(B|A)) and the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black attacker. We are given the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) as 15%, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a black person correctly (P(B|A)) as 80%. We are also given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time (P(B|not A)).

However, we are not given the prior probability of the witness identifying a white person correctly (P(B|not A)) or the total number of people in the city (P(B)). To estimate the probability of a white person being the attacker (P(not A)), we can use the fact that the total population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(not A) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black (P(B|not A)) can be calculated as the complement of P(B|A), since the witness's error rate is the same for both races:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as white (P(B|A)) is given as 0.2.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now, let's do the calculation:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12%. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions, including that the witness's error rate is the same for both races and that the total number of people in the city is represented by the percentages given. These assumptions may not be accurate in real-world situations, and further investigation may be needed to obtain a more precise estimate.
