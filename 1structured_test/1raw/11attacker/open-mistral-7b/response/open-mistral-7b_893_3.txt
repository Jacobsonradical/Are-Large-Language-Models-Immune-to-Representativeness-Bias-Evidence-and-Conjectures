Given the information provided, we have two sources of data: the demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The demographics of the city suggest that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, the most objective estimate would be based on the city's demographics, which is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have the witness's testimony that the attacker was identified as black.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, we cannot fully trust their identification, especially considering they only saw the attacker from behind. If we assume that the witness's identification is incorrect due to their error rate, then the attacker is more likely to be white (given the city's demographics).

However, the witness's identification was not dismissed entirely, and the court found it to be somewhat credible. If we consider the witness's identification as an additional piece of evidence, we can adjust our estimate based on the probability of the witness being correct given their error rate.

The probability of the witness being correct is the inverse of their error rate: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is 0.8 (the probability of the witness being correct) * 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black in the city) + 0.2 (the probability of the witness being incorrect) * 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white in the city).

Plugging in the numbers, we get: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

In summary, considering both the city's demographics and the witness's identification, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is 29%. However, it is important to note that this estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the witness's identification.
