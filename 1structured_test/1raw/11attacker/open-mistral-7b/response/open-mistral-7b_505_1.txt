To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, while they make errors 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information about how this witness's performance differs in low-light conditions or under duress, which might have been the case during the nighttime attack.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of A, and P(B|A) and P(B) are the conditional and marginal probabilities, respectively.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability the witness correctly identifies a black attacker), P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black), and P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 (overall probability of the witness identifying anyone as black).

Plugging these numbers into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.18) = 0.4444

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.44 or 44%.
