Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence: The witness's identification

From the information given, we know:
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black in the population (this is what we want to estimate)
- P(E|H): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (from the witness's reliability)
- P(E|~H): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (complementary probability)
- P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker not being black in the population (complementary probability)

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2.

From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.182

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18.2%.
