Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. This is what we're trying to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the hypothesis before considering any evidence. According to the first piece of information, 15% of the population is black, so P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white. Given that the witness correctly identifies half of the time and errs the other half, P(E) = 0.5.

So, P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
