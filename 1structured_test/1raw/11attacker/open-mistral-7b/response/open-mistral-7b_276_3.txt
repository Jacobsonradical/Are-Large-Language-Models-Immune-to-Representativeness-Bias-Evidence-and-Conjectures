Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem used for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

The prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence) can be estimated from the population statistics given. Since 15% of the population is black, the prior probability is 0.15.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black) can be estimated from the witness's reliability. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the likelihood is 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black).

The likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis (the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is not black) can be estimated similarly. Since the attacker is white 85% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

So, the likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis is 0.97 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white).

Applying Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the hypothesis (the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence) is the prior probability times the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by the prior probability times the likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis:

0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.03) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.116 = 0.128

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.128 or 12.8%.
