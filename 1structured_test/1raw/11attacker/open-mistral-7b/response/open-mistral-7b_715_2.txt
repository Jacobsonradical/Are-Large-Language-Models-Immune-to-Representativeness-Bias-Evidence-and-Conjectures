Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the population distribution in the city.

The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. However, in this case, we don't have the actual race of the attacker, so we can't directly apply this reliability rate. Instead, we can use it to calculate the probability distribution of the attacker's race given the witness's statement.

The witness said the attacker was black. If the witness is correct, the attacker is indeed black. If the witness is wrong, then the attacker is white. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability that they are wrong in this case is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that a random attacker is black is 0.15.

The Bayes' theorem can help us calculate the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is black. However, since we don't have the actual numbers, we can't directly apply it. Instead, we can use the witness's reliability to estimate this probability.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, if the attacker is indeed black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies this is 0.8.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness being correct times the probability of the attacker being black.

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.12, this is 0.8 (the probability of the witness being correct) times 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black)}
