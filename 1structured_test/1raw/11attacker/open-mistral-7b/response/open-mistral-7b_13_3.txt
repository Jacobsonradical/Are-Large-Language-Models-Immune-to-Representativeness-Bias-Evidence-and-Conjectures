Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we can consider this as an error.

The probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's error, is the proportion of the population that is white. In other words, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (85%).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, is the proportion of the population that is black, which is 0.15 (15%).

However, we are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, not given the error, but given the original observation that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies black people as black 20% of the time, we need to account for this in our estimation.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, is the probability that the witness made an error times the probability that the attacker is black in the population.

This probability is 0.2 (the error rate) times 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population), which equals 0.03 or 3%.

However, this calculation assumes that the error rate of 20% applies to all situations, including when the witness is certain. This might not be the case, and the error rate might be lower when the witness is certain. Therefore, this calculation should be interpreted with caution and further investigation may be necessary.

{probability: 0.03, please note that this is an estimate based on uncertain assumptions}
