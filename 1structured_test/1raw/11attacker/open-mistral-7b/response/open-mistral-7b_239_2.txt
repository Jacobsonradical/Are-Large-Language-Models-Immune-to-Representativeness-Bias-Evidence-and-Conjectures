Given the two pieces of information, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally distributed between identifying whites as blacks and vice versa, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 10% (since 20% error rate / 2 = 10%).

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness's error (10%).

On the other hand, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness's correct identification (80%) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black in the city (15%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.12}
