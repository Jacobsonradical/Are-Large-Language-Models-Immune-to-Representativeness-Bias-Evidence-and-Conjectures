To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula in probability theory that describes the probability of a hypothesis H being true given evidence E. In this case, H is the attacker being black, and E is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Here's what each term means:
- P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify someone as black given that they are actually black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the probability of an attacker being black in the population. This can be estimated from the given population statistics. The city is 85% white and 15% black, so P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making such an identification, regardless of whether the attacker is black or not. This can be estimated as the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|not H) * P(not H), where P(not H) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 0.85, and P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black. The problem does not give us this probability, but we can assume it is the same as the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2.

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|E): P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 = 0.52381

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.52 or 52%.
