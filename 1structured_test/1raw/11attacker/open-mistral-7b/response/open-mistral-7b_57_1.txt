To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person
- P(E|~H): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying white people as black)

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)].

To calculate P(~H), we can use the complementary probability, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (the proportion of white people in the city).

Now, let's calculate P(E|~H):
Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a 20% chance, P(E|~H) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Using a calculator to compute the probability, we get: P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.38

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.38 or 38%.
