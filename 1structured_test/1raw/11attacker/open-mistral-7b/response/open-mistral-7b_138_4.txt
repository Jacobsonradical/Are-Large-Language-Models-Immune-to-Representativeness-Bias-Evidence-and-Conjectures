To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race, but also errs 20% of the time. Given that the person was attacked in the dark and the witness could not see the attacker's features clearly, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate might be higher in this specific situation. Let's use the given 20% error rate as a conservative estimate.

Now, let's consider the racial composition of the city. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we have two possibilities:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identification.

The probability of the first possibility is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the race. The probability of the second possibility is the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error.

Given the racial composition of the city, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15, and the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the race is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.2.

So, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability that the attacker is white and the witness made an error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can ignore the probability of the attacker being white and the witness correctly identifying the race. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness made an error added to the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, as mentioned earlier, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate might be higher in this specific situation. To account for this, let's increase the error rate to 25%.

With a 25% error rate, the probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the race is 0.15 * 0.75 = 0.1125.

The probability of the attacker being white and the witness making an error is 0.85 * 0.25 = 0.2125.

The total probability that the attacker is black is 0.1125 + 0.2125 = 0.325.

Given the information available, and accounting for the possibility of the witness's error rate being higher in this specific situation, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.325 (or 32.5%).
