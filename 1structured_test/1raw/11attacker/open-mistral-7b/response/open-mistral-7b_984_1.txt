Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in statistics and probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- Θ: the population race distribution (85% white, 15% black)
- E: the witness's identification of the attacker as black

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

1. P(E|H): the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8

2. P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is black, given by the racial distribution in the city, which is 0.15

3. P(E): the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a black person (when the person is actually black) and incorrectly identifying a white person (when the person is actually white).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2
Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate P(E) as follows:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.376

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.376 or 37.6%.
