To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the race and a 20% chance of error. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, the probability of the witness's statement being true is the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the true probability of the attacker being black, plus the probability of the witness making an error multiplied by the true probability of the attacker being white.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white. We can set up the following equation:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = 0.5 (since the witness had a 50% chance of correctly identifying the race)

We also know that the total probability of the attacker being black or white is 1, so P(black) + P(white) = 1.

We have two equations with two unknowns. To solve this system of equations, we can use the following approach:

1. Multiply the first equation by 100 to make the terms more readable:
   80 * P(black) + 20 * P(white) = 50

2. Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   80 * P(black) + 20 * (1 - P(black)) = 50

3. Simplify the equation:
   80 * P(black) + 20 - 20 * P(black) = 50
   60 * P(black) = 30
   P(black) = 0.5

However, since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, it is unlikely that the attacker is truly equally likely to be black or white. The witness's statement seems to be an incorrect identification.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information. The witness's statement may be an error, and the true probability of the attacker being black could be significantly different than the 50% estimate derived from the witness's reliability.
