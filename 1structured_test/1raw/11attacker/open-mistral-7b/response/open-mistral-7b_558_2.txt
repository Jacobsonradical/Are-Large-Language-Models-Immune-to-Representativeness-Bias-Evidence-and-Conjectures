To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental principle in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the proportion of black people in the city (given in the second piece of information: 15% or 0.15).
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (given in the first piece of information: 80% or 0.8).
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (assuming the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a white person as black, so this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).
- P(B|W) is what we want to estimate, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 24%.
