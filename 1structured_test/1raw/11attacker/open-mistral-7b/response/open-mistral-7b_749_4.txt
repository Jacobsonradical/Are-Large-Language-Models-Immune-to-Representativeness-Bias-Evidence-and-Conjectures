Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to identify race is not necessarily representative of the city's population distribution.

Let's assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual population distribution. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be equal to the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a black person.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-world scenarios, as a witness's ability to identify race may be influenced by the actual population distribution. Without more information, it's difficult to provide a more accurate estimate.
