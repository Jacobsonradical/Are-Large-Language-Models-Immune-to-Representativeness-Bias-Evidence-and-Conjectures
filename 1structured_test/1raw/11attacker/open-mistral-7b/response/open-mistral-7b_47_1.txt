Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote the hypothesis H as "The attacker is black," and the evidence E as "The witness identified the attacker as black."

The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is given by the witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 0.8.

The probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is the proportion of black people in the population, which is 0.15 (given in information b).

The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (P(E|~H)) is the probability of the witness misidentifying the race, which is 0.2 (given in information a).

The probability of the negation of the hypothesis (P(~H)) is the proportion of white people in the population, which is 0.85 (given in information b).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 25%.
