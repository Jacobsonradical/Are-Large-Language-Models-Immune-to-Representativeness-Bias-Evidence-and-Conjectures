Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), where P(B|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the event, P(A) is the prior probability of the event, and P(B) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

1. We know the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black: P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the first piece of information).
2. We know the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect given that the attacker is black: P(not B|A) = 0.2 (also from the first piece of information).
3. We know the prior probability of the attacker being black: P(A) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information, as 15% of the population is black).
4. We know the probability of the witness's identification being correct or incorrect in general: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(not B|A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
