Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. The racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness made a mistake in this case. In that case, the attacker is actually white (since the witness said the attacker was black). The probability of this error occurring is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

If the attacker is actually white, then the probability of the witness making a mistake given the racial distribution of the city is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness was correct. In that case, the attacker is actually black. The probability of this happening is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

So, the total probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness being correct plus the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being white, multiplied by the probability of that error occurring.

This can be calculated as 0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.8 + 0.034 = 0.834 or 83.4%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.834, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
