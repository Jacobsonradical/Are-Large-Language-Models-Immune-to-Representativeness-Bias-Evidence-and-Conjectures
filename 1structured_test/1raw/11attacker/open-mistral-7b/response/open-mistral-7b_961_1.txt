Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have specific information about how many white and black people the witness encountered in their sample that they correctly identified.

The population statistics given in the information (85% white and 15% black) do not directly apply to the witness's ability to identify race, as the witness's sample could be biased towards one race or the other.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a definitive probability estimate for the attacker's race. It would require more specific information about the witness's sample and their performance on that sample.
