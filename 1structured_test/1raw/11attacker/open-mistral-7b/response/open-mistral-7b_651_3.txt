Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote the hypothesis as H (attacker is black) and the evidence as E (witness identification).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)].

From the information given, we know:
1. P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of the population that is black)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
4. P(~H) = 0.85 (proportion of the population that is white)

Since the witness's observations are independent of the population distribution, we can assume that P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.12 + 0.017 = 0.137.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = [0.1 * 0.8] / 0.137 â‰ˆ 0.58

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.58 or 58%.
