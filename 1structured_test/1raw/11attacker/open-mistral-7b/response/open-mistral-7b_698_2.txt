To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify race, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race given that the attacker is black. Let P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black. The probability of the attacker being not black is 1 - P(A), and we can denote it as P(~A).

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (85% white population)
P(~A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying black people)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.23 = 0.5217

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.52 or 52%. This estimate takes into account the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.
