To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we interpret the erroneous identifications as misidentifications of black individuals as white, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of an attacker being black is the proportion of black individuals in the city. This can be estimated by multiplying the witness's accuracy in identifying black individuals by the proportion of black individuals in the city:

probability = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%

However, the witness's mistake rate is not accounted for in this calculation. If we assume that the witness's error rate applies equally to both white and black individuals, then the actual probability of an attacker being black could be higher.

To account for the error rate, we can consider the possibility that the witness misidentified a white individual as black. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black individuals in the city minus the probability of the witness misidentifying a white individual as black:

probability = 0.15 - 0.20 * (1 - 0.15 / 0.85)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
probability = 0.15 - 0.20 * (0.85 / 0.85) * (0.15 / 0.85)
probability = 0.15 - 0.20 * (0.15 / 0.85)
probability = 0.15 - 0.03
probability = 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, based on the given information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%, but this estimate may be conservative if the witness's error rate applies equally to both white and black individuals.
