To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly, which is 0.8 (from the information provided).
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we need to estimate based on the racial demographics of the city. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, which we can calculate as the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 (34%).
