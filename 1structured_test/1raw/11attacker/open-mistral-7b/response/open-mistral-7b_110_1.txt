To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness made an error in identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black) and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

Given the witness's accuracy, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is truly black is P(black). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is P(white) * 0.20 (the error rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation based on the likelihood of these two scenarios:

P(witness identifies black) = P(black) * 0.80 + P(white) * 0.20 * 0.80

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so the left side of the equation is 1. We can now solve for P(black):

1 = 0.80 * P(black) + 0.16 * (1 - P(black))

P(black) = (1 - 0.16) / 0.80
P(black) = 0.84

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.84 or 84%.
