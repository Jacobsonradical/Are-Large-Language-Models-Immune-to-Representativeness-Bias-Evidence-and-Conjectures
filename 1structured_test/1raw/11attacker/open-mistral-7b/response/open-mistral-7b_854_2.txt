The information provided consists of two parts: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can't directly use these percentages to estimate the attacker's race because we don't know if the witness was incorrect in this case.

However, we do know that the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black. This means that there must be an 80% chance that the witness was correct in their identification.

Since 15% of the population is black, if the witness's identification is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: 0.8}
