Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimation. The population statistics give us that 85% of people in the city are white, and 15% are black. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given that the witness's incorrect identification rate is higher than the actual population ratio of blacks in the city (15% vs 20%), it seems that the witness may be more likely to misidentify a white person as black than to correctly identify a black person.

Therefore, it might be more reasonable to assume that the witness's identification is an error in this case, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race. In such a scenario, we would estimate the attacker's race based on the population statistics, which suggests that the attacker is likely white (85% chance).

However, it's important to note that this is an assumption and a probability estimate based on the given information. In a real-world court case, additional evidence and more detailed information about the circumstances of the attack and the witness's reliability would be considered.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
{probability: 0.85, please note that this is an estimation based on assumptions and the given information}
