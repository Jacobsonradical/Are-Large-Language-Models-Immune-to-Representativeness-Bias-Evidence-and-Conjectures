To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying race. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness erred when they should have identified the attacker as white, given the city's racial demographics.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). We also know that the probability that the attacker is white is P(White) = 1 - P(Black).

The witness identified the attacker as black, which is an error in this context. The probability of this error occurring is equal to the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is actually white. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

Given these probabilities, we can set up a conditional probability equation:

P(Witness errs | Attacker is White) = 0.2

According to Bayes' theorem, we can express the probability of the attacker being black in terms of this conditional probability and the prior probabilities:

P(Black) = P(Witness errs | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White) / [P(Witness errs | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness errs | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

We know the values of P(Witness errs | Attacker is White) and P(Attacker is White), but we don't have direct information about P(Witness errs | Attacker is Black) and P(Attacker is Black). However, we can make an assumption that the witness is equally likely to err when identifying a black attacker as when identifying a white attacker. This assumption implies that P(Witness errs | Attacker is Black) = 0.2 as well.

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(Black) = 0.2 * 0.15 / [0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this expression gives us:

P(Black) â‰ˆ 0.218

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 21.8%.
