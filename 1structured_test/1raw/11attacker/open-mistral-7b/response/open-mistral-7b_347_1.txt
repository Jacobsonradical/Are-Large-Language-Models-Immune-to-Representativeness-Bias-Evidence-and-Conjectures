To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

If the witness's identification is reliable, we would expect their reported race to match the actual race 80% of the time. Therefore, if the witness reports that the attacker is black, we can infer that the attacker is actually black 80% of the time.

However, since the witness might have made an error, we need to account for this. The witness's error rate is 20%. This means that when the witness reports a race, they are actually wrong 20% of the time.

Given that the witness reported that the attacker is black, there's a 20% chance that they made an error. If they made an error, the attacker is actually white, not black.

So, the probability that the witness's report of a black attacker is correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that it's an error is 0.2 (20%).

However, since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that a random person is white is actually 0.85, and the probability that a random person is black is 0.15.

When the witness reports a black attacker, they are actually correct 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%) of the time when the attacker is actually white, and they are correct 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%) of the time when the attacker is actually black.

Therefore, the total probability that the witness's report of a black attacker is correct is 0.12 (12%) + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.152 (15.2%).

So, based on the witness's report and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.152 (15.2%).
