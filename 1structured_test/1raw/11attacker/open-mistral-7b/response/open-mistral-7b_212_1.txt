Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The total population in the city is 100%, and 85% is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately judge race is only 80% correct. This means they make errors 20% of the time.
3. When the witness makes an error, they are more likely to mistakenly identify a white person as black, given the city's demographics.

However, without sufficient information about the witness's specific errors, it's impossible to provide an exact probability that the attacker is black. We can only make an approximation.

Assuming that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between misidentifying whites as blacks and misidentifying blacks as whites, and that their overall accuracy is 80%, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

1. The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time.
2. But since they also make errors 20% of the time, we need to subtract these errors from our total population percentage of 15% black people.
3. So, the "actual" percentage of times the witness correctly identifies a black person is 80% * 15% = 12%.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is this 12% adjusted for the witness's error rate.

Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot calculate this adjusted percentage precisely. It would require knowing the specific proportion of the witness's errors that involve misidentifying blacks as whites, which is not provided in the information given.

Therefore, the best answer I can provide, strictly in the requested dictionary format, is:
{probability: an estimated value, but not a specific number between 0 and 1}
