Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying a person's race, but errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we also know that the witness made an error in this specific case, as the victim could not see the attacker's race.
3. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of an error given that the witness identified the attacker as black is 0.20.
4. The probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is black, is therefore 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
5. We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
6. Given that the victim could not see the attacker's race, the probability of the attacker being black is independent of the witness's identification.
7. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is simply the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which is 0.15.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.

This answer assumes that the witness's error rate is constant and independent of the race of the person being identified. If this assumption is not valid, the problem would require a more complex analysis.
