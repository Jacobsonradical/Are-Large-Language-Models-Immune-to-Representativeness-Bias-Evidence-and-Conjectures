Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the event that the attacker is black, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The terms in Bayes' theorem are as follows:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's population composition: P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 by the witness's abilities.
- P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2 by the witness's abilities.
- P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being non-black, which is given by the city's population composition: P(~A) = 0.85
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|~A) * P(~A).

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.2424

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
