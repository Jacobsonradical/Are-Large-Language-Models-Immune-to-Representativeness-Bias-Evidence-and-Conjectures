To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correctly identifying race), and the racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Since the witness's identification is not perfect, we can't simply assume that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement. Instead, we need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (this is called the true positive rate).

The true positive rate is the product of the witness's reliability (80%) and the proportion of black people in the city (15%):

True positive rate = Witness's reliability * Proportion of black people
                         = 0.8 * 0.15
                         = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white (this is called the false positive rate).

The false positive rate is the product of the witness's error rate (20%) and the proportion of white people in the city (85%):

False positive rate = Witness's error rate * Proportion of white people
                          = 0.2 * 0.85
                          = 0.17

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem:

Probability of attacker being black = (True positive rate) / (True positive rate + False positive rate)
                                          = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                          = 0.12 / 0.29
                                          â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%. This means that given the information provided, it is slightly more likely that the attacker is black than white, but still not a strong indication. It's important to remember that this is a probability estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and other factors may influence the actual probability.
