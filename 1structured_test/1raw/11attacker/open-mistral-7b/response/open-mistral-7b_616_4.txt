Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(B|A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8. Let P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. We are given that P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Let P(A|B) be the probability we want to find, which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

We are given that P(B|~A) = 0.2 and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. We are also given that P(B|A) = 0.8. Therefore, we can solve for P(A):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.172

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.2%.
