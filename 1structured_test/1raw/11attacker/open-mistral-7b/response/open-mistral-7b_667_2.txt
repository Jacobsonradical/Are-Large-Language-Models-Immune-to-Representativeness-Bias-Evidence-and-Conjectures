Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the racial distribution of the city, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% from the city's racial distribution)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (given in the text as 80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (given in the text as 20%)
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black (which is what we want to find)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values we have:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.235, or 23.5%. This is a relatively small increase in the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's identification, which suggests that the witness may not have been very reliable in this situation. However, without more information, this is the best estimate we can provide based on the given information.
