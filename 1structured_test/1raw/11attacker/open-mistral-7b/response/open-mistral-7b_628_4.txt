To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given this information, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being black:

1. If the attacker is actually black, the witness will correctly identify the attacker's race 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is 0.8.

2. If the attacker is actually white, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker's race 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black is 0.2.

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black by considering two possibilities: either the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, or the witness made an error.

The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%). Since the attacker's race is unknown, these probabilities are added: 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.

However, since the probabilities should sum up to 100% for all possible outcomes, we can subtract the probability of the witness making an error from 1 to get the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness has identified the attacker as black:

The probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker is 0.8, and the probability of a black attacker is 0.15 (15%). So, the probability of both events happening is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
