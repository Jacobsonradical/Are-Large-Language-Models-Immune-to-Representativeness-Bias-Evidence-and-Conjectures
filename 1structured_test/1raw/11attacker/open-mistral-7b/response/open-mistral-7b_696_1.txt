Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (85% from the city's population).
- P(not B) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (15% from the city's population).
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black.
- P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black.

Given the witness's performance, we know that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|not B) = 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the evidence is W. Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given this evidence:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.85] / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15] = 0.6957

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 69.57%. This means that, based on the evidence and the witness's reliability, there is a slightly more than 69% chance that the attacker is black.
