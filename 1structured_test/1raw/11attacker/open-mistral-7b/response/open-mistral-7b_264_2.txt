Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is not 85%, as initially suggested in piece of information "a". Instead, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since we know that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this means that the witness mistakes white people for black people about 20% of the time when they are actually looking at white people (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%).

When the witness correctly identifies race, they correctly identify black people 80% of the time (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%). However, since we know that the witness mistakenly identifies white people as black 17% of the time, the actual number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person in a real-world situation will be higher than 12%.

To find this number, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is black", event B is "the witness identifies a black person", and the probability of event B given event A is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time). The probability of event A is 0.15 (the population is 15% black).

The probability of event B is the sum of the probability of event A given event B and the probability of event B given not event A times the probability of not event A. In our case, the probability of event B given not event A is 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies white people as black 20% of the time), and the probability of not event A is 0.85 (the population is 85% white).

The probability of event B is then 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 or 24%.

Since the witness identifies a black person about 24% of the time when they are actually looking at a black person, and they mistakenly identify a white person as black about 17% of the time, the actual probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is higher than 24%. However, without more information, it is not possible to calculate an exact value for this probability.

Therefore, while we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate, it is likely that the probability that the attacker is black is higher than 24%, but lower than 100%.
