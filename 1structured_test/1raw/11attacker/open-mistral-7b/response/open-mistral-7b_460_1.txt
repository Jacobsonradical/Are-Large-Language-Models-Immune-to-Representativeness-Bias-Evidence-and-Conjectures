Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is reasonably accurate in identifying race, incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time in similar conditions.
3. The witness correctly identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black.
- P(H) is the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness identifying someone as black).

We know P(E|H) from the witness's accuracy: P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% accuracy).

We know P(H) from the population statistics: P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population).

We don't have direct information about P(E), but we can calculate it using the complementary probability: P(E) = 1 - P(not E) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
         = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8
         = 0.12

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes the witness's accuracy is the same in this specific situation as it is in their sample. If the witness's accuracy is lower or higher in this specific situation, the probability would change accordingly.
