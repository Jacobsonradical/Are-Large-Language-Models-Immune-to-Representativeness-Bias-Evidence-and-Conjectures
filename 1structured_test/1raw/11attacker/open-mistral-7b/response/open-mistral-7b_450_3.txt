To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

In our case:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We have the following data:
- P(H) = Probability of the attacker being black in the population. We don't know this, but we can estimate it based on the city's demographics: P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population)
- P(E|H) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. This is given in the first piece of information: P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% correct)
- P(E|~H) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate this as: P(E|~H) = [0.2 * (1 - 0.85)] / 0.85 = 0.0228 (2.28%)
- P(~H) = Probability of the attacker not being black. Since P(H) = 0.15, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
- P(E) = Probability of the witness making any identification. This is equal to the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.0228 * 0.85 = 0.1342

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1342 â‰ˆ 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.6, or 60%.
