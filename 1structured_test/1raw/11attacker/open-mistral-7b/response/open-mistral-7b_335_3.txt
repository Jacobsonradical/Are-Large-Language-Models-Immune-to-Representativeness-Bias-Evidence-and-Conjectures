Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. Let's denote the probability of the hypothesis H (attacker is black) as p(H), and the probability of the evidence E (witness's statement) as p(E).

We also need to consider two other probabilities:

1. The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, p(E|H), which is the probability that a black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness. From the information given, we know that the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time when judging race, so p(E|H) = 0.2.
2. The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, p(E|~H), which is the probability that a white person would be mistakenly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time, p(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.
3. The prior probability of the hypothesis, p(H), which is the probability of the attacker being black in the general population.

According to the information given, 15% of the population is black, so p(H) = 0.15.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

p(H|E) = p(E|H) * p(H) / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|~H) * p(~H)]

Substituting the values we have:

p(H|E) = 0.2 * 0.15 / [0.2 * 0.15 + 0.16 * 0.85]

p(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.173

So, given the witness's statement, there is approximately a 17.3% chance that the attacker is black. However, we should also consider the probability that the witness was mistaken, which is not accounted for in this calculation. If the witness's statement is unreliable, the actual probability of the attacker being black could be higher or lower than 17.3%.
