Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct information about whether the witness's identification was correct in this case.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it would be reasonable to assume that the majority of people the witness encounters are white, which could make the witness more likely to err in identifying a black person.

However, without knowing whether the witness's identification was correct in this case, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer in the requested dictionary format.
