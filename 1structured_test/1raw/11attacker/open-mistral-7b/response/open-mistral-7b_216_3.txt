To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (this is what the witness's ability tells us).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without knowing the hypothesis).

We are given:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the attacker is black, based on the city's population)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H) (where ~H means the attacker is not black)
  P(E | ~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time)
  P(~H) = 0.85 (the attacker is not black, based on the city's population)

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.2414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
