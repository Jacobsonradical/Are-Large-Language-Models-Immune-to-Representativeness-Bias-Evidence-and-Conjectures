Based on the information provided, the attacker was initially described as being of unknown race by the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge race and found that they were correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, and given that the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black carries some weight.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can consider the possibility that the witness made an error and misidentified the attacker as black. Using the given error rate of 20%, we can calculate the probability that the witness was correct in their identification as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is black is 15% (since 15% of the population is black).
2. The probability that the witness made an error and misidentified a white person as black is 20%.
3. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is 1 - 20% = 80%.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability of this event (either the attacker is black or the witness made an error) is the sum of the two probabilities: 15% (attacker is black) + 20% (witness error).
5. However, since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, we can subtract the probability of the witness error from the total probability to get the probability that the attacker is actually black: 15% + 20% - 20% * 80% = 15% + 0% = 15%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15%. This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.
