Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time.
2. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness description) = P(Witness description | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / P(Witness description)

First, let's calculate P(Witness description | Attacker is black):
P(Witness description | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (probability of correct identification)

Next, let's calculate P(Witness description | Attacker is white):
P(Witness description | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (probability of error)

Since there are twice as many white people as black people, the prior probability P(Attacker is black) is 0.15 and P(Attacker is white) is 0.85.

We can now calculate P(Witness description):
P(Witness description) = P(Witness description | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness description | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)
P(Witness description) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness description:
P(Attacker is black | Witness description) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

In summary, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
