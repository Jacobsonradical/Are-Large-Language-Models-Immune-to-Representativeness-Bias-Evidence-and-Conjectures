To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. In this case, we can assume that when the witness makes a mistake, they are more likely to misidentify a black person as white (given the racial demographics of the city) than the other way around.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is then 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, and the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Given the witness's testimony that the attacker was black, the probability of this testimony being true is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.12) and the probabilities of the witness making an error in the other direction (0.03).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is P(black) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 15%.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not be the case. If the error rate is indeed higher when the witness misidentifies a black person as white, then the true probability of the attacker being black may be higher than 15%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is P(black) = 0.15, but with some degree of uncertainty due to the potential dependence of the witness's error rate on the actual race of the attacker.
