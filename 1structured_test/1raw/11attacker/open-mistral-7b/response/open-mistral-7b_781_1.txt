Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the population statistics and the witness's identification accuracy. The witness's identification is not a perfect reflection of the population distribution. If the witness's errors are random, then they could potentially result in an overestimate or underestimate of the true population proportion.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker is black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can estimate the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) by using the witness's identification accuracy. Since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which we can estimate from the population distribution. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.

The probability of the evidence (P(E)) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2, and P(E) = 1 - P(E|~H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
       = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the population proportion of black people in the city (15%), suggesting that the witness's identification may have been an error. However, it's important to note that this is a simple analysis and does not account for potential biases or errors in the population distribution or the witness's identification accuracy. A more sophisticated analysis would be needed to draw more reliable conclusions.
