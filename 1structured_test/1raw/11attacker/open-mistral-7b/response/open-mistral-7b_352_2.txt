To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution in the population.

The witness's reliability is 80%, meaning they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. The city's racial distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race, and E as the event that the attacker is black. The probability of W given E is 0.8 (from the witness's reliability).

The probability of E is the question we want to find. The probability of E given W is 15/100 (the proportion of black people in the city). Since we don't know the probability of the complementary event, not-E, we can't directly use Bayes' theorem.

However, we can make an educated guess by considering the alternative event, not-E, which is the attacker being white. The probability of not-E given W is 1 - (15/100) = 0.85 (from the city's racial distribution).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, the probability of W given not-E is 0.2.

The probability of not-E is the complementary event of E, so P(not-E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem for the complementary event, we can write P(not-E) as P(not-E) = P(W | not-E) * P(not-E) + P(not-W | not-E) * P(not-E), where P(not-W | not-E) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the race as not-E when it is actually not-E.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, P(not-W | not-E) is 0.2. So, P(not-E) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17.

However, since we don't know the value of P(not-W | not-E), we can't calculate the exact probability of E. Instead, we can estimate it based on the available information.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, it seems plausible that the attacker could be black despite the witness's statement. Considering the racial distribution in the city, it's also plausible that the attacker could be white.

Therefore, while we can't provide a strict numerical estimate, it seems reasonable to consider that the probability of the attacker being black is close to 15% (the racial distribution in the city). However, this estimate should be taken with caution due to the limited information available.
