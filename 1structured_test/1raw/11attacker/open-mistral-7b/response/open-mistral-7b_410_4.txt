To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and our evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence. This is the proportion of black people in the city, which we know is 0.15 (15%).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence without considering the hypothesis. This is the probability that the witness makes the same identification, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness makes the correct identification 80% of the time, and half the population is black, we can calculate P(E|not H) (the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black) by multiplying the probability of the witness making an error (0.2) and the probability of the attacker being white (0.85). Then, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H).

First, let's calculate P(E|not H):

P(E|not H) = P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) is the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time and half the population is white, P(witness identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(E|not H):

P(E|not H) = 0.17

Next, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.1485
P(E) = 0.2685

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2685
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.2843

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 28.43%.
