Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have direct evidence that the witness's identification is correct in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black (from information b). We can use this population distribution as a reference to make an educated guess about the likelihood of the attacker being black, considering the witness's error rate and identification.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In this case, there is a 85% chance (given the city's population distribution) that the witness will erroneously identify the attacker as black due to their 20% error rate.

On the other hand, if the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time.

Since we do not have confirmation of the attacker's race, we should consider both scenarios and weigh them according to their respective probabilities.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is therefore:

(probability of attacker being black and witness being correct) * (probability of witness being correct) + (probability of attacker being white and witness making an error) * (probability of witness making an error)

Substituting the given values, we get:

(0.15 * 0.8) * 0.8 + (0.85 * 0.2) * 0.2 = 0.12 * 0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.096 + 0.034 = 0.13

So, based on this analysis, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.13 or 13%. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and actual events may deviate from these probabilities.
