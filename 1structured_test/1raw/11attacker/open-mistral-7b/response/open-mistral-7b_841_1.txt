Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't have information about the racial composition of the group the witness was observing in the sample size.

Without this additional information, it's not possible to calculate an exact probability. But we can make an assumption that the witness's sample size is representative of the city's population. In this case, we can use the city's population data to approximate the attacker's race.

The attacker's race being black corresponds to an error in the witness's judgment (given that the witness saw the attacker but could not identify the race). Given that the error rate is 20%, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, would be 20%.

However, if we assume that the witness's sample size is not representative of the city's population, the probability could be different. Without more information, we can't make a more precise estimate.

{probability: 0.2, note: This is an approximation based on the assumption that the witness's sample size is representative of the city's population.}
