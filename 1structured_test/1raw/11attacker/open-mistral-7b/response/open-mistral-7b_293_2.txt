To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let's break this down:

1. Hypothesis: The attacker is black.
2. Evidence: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

- The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time (p(black|witnessed black) = 0.8)
- The witness errs 20% of the time (p(not black|witnessed black) = 0.2)
- The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (as per the city demographics, p(black) = 0.15)
- The prior probability of the attacker being white is 85% (p(not black) = 0.85)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness making the identification given that the attacker is black (p(witnessed black|black)) using the given probabilities:

p(witnessed black|black) = p(black|witnessed black) * p(black) / (p(black|witnessed black) * p(black) + p(not black|witnessed black) * p(not black))

Plugging in the values:

p(witnessed black|black) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)) = 0.12

So the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

p(black|witnessed black) = p(witnessed black|black) * p(black) / p(witnessed black)

To find p(witnessed black), we can use the law of total probability:

p(witnessed black) = p(witnessed black|black) * p(black) + p(witnessed black|not black) * p(not black)

However, we are not given the probability of the witness making an identification error when the attacker is white (p(witnessed black|not black)). To make a reasonable estimate, we can assume that the witness's error rate when identifying race is the same, regardless of the actual race of the person. This assumption is not ideal, but it is the best we can do with the given information.

So, p(witnessed black|not black) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate p(witnessed black):

p(witnessed black) = (0.12) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.21

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

p(black|witnessed black) = (0.12) * (0.15) / (0.21) = 0.0762 or 7.62%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 7.62%. This is a significant decrease from the 15% prior probability based on city demographics, suggesting that the witness's identification is not reliable in this case.
