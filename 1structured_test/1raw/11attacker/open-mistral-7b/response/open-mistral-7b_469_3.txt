Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know the exact racial composition of the people the witness saw that night. Let's assume that the people the witness saw were not disproportionately white or black compared to the city's population.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the witness saw a higher number of white people than black people, given the city's demographics. Therefore, we would expect the witness to make more errors when identifying black people, as they are less common.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black, which means they made a correct identification in this case. This suggests that the attacker was more likely to be black than white, given the witness's reliability.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and actual probability may vary}
