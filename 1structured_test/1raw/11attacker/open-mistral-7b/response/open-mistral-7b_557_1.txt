Given the information provided, we can calculate an estimated probability that the attacker is black.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have enough information about the specific population the witness was judging to directly apply these percentages to the case at hand.

We do know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the population the witness was judging in the past, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (or 80%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is what we want to find.
P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which is the sum of the probability of identifying a black person as black (P(B|A)) and the probability of identifying a white person as black (P(B|not A)). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this would be P(B|not A) = 0.2 (or 20%).

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|not A) directly. We only know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness makes an error by mistaking a white person for a black person with the same probability as mistaking a black person for a white person, then P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.2 / 0.85 = 0.025, or 2.5%.

With these values, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.025 * 0.85) = 0.56, or 56%

So, given the information provided and the assumption that the witness makes mistakes with the same probability for black and white people, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 56%.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate based on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be different. The calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is constant and independent of the specific population at hand, which might not be the case. It also assumes that the witness makes mistakes by mistaking a white person for a black person with the same probability as mistaking a black person for a white person, which might not be the case. Finally, it assumes that the attacker's race is independent of the population the witness was judging in the past, which might not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be treated with caution.
