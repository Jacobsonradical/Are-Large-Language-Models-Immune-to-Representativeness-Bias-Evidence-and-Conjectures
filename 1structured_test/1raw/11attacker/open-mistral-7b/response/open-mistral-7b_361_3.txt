To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, this is 0.15 (or 15%).

2. P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. From the information given, this is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the attacker is black 15% of the time).

3. P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is white 85% of the time, this means the witness will incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time when they see them in the dark. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), which is 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
              = 0.8 * 0.15 / 1
              = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the population, it's slightly more likely that the attacker is white than black, but not by a significant margin. This is a rough estimate and should be treated with caution, as it assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is consistent and accurate, which may not be the case.
