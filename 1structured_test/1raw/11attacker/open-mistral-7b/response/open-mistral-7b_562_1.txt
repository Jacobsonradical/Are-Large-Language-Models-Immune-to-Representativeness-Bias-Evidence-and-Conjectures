Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We also have two probabilities:
1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can estimate from the city's demographics. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(A) = 0.15.
2. P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. From the witness's performance, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B|~A): The likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness was correct 80% of the time when the person was actually white, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know P(B|A), P(A), and P(B|~A) from the provided information. To find P(~A), we can use the fact that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.12 or 12%.
