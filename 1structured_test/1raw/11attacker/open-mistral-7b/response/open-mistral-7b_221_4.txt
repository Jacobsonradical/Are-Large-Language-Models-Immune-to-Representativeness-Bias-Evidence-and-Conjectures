Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (as stated in the first piece of information), and the racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black (as stated in the second piece of information).

The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person, given that they did in fact identify someone as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability:

P(Attacker is Black) = P(Witness identifies Attacker as Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / P(Witness identifies Attacker as Black)

We are given P(Witness identifies Attacker as Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8, P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information), and P(Witness identifies Attacker as Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the sum of the probabilities of the witness getting it right and getting it wrong)

So, P(Attacker is Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.8333

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
