Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct. In this case, the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this event happening is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).

Now, let's consider the case where the witness's identification is incorrect. In this case, the attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identifies him as black. The probability of this event happening is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).

Since the witness's identification is not reliable enough to definitively conclude that the attacker is black (given that the witness could have made an error), we should consider both scenarios and weight them according to their probabilities.

The overall probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the sum of the probability of the correct identification and the probability of the incorrect identification multiplied by the probability that the witness will make that particular error.

The probability of the correct identification is 0.15. The probability of the incorrect identification is 0.2, and the probability of the witness making that error is 0.2 (given that the witness errs 20% of the time).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.15 + 0.004 = 0.154.

However, given that the witness's error rate is quite high (20%), it might be more prudent to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in this case. In that case, the attacker would likely be white, given that the majority of the city's population is white. Therefore, while the exact probability that the attacker is black is 0.154, it is important to consider the reliability of the witness's statement.
