Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, and makes an error 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these facts, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that relates conditional probabilities. In this case, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black (P(A = black)) given the witness's observation (P(W = observed black)).

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(A = black | W = observed black) = P(W = observed black | A = black) * P(A = black) / P(W = observed black)

1. P(W = observed black | A = black) is the probability that the witness will identify a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
2. P(A = black) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is what we are trying to find.
3. P(W = observed black) is the probability that the witness will observe a black person, which can be calculated from the racial demographics of the city: 0.15 (15%).

We can rewrite the equation as: P(A = black | W = observed black) = 0.8 * P(A = black) / 0.15

To solve for P(A = black), we can rearrange the equation to: P(A = black) = 0.8 * P(W = observed black) / P(W = observed black | A = black)

Substituting the values, we get: P(A = black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
