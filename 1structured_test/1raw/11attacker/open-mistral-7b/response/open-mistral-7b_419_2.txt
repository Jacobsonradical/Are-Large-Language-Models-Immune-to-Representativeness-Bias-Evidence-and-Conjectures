Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, it could be a correct identification or an error. Since we don't know if the witness got it right or wrong, we need to consider both possibilities.

The probability of the witness getting it right is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of getting it wrong is 0.2 (20%). But in the case of an error, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black, which means the attacker is actually white. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a white person being misidentified as black is 0.85 (85%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is the probability of the witness getting it right, which is 0.8, multiplied by the probability that the witness was correct, which is the probability that the attacker is actually black given that they were identified as black, which is 1 - the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a black person as white, or 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64%.
