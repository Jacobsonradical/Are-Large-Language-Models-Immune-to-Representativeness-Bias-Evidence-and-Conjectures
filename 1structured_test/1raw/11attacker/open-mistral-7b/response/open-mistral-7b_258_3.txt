Given the information provided, we have a witness who is relatively accurate in identifying race but is not perfectly reliable, with an error rate of 20%. The witness identified the attacker as black. We also know the racial demographics of the city, with 85% of the population being white and 15% being black.

Let's reason through this problem:
1. The witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person and a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a black person as white.
2. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
   b) The attacker is white, but the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as black.
3. The probability of scenario a) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (or 80%).
4. The probability of scenario b) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is the error rate of 0.2 (or 20%).
5. Since the attacker is either black or white, the total probability of both scenarios should add up to 1.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%), and the probability that the attacker is white is 0.2 (or 20%). However, since we are only interested in the probability of the attacker being black, the answer is {probability: 0.8}.
