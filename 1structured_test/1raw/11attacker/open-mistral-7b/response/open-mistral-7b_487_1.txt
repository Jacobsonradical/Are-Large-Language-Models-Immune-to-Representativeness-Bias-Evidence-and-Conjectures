To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the data)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person (given in the data)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is not black (which is 1 - P(A))

The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, so 15% black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies white people 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.289

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 28.9%.
