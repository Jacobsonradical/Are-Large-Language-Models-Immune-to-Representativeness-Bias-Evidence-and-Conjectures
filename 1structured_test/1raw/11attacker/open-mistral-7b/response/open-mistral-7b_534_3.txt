To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we have:
- H: attacker is black
- E: witness identified attacker as black

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(E) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
           = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
           = 0.12 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
