Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In this case, event A is the attacker being black (A), and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black (B).

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black: P(A) = 15% (from information a)
2. Probability of the witness identifying a black person as black: P(B|A) = 80% (from information b)
3. Probability of the witness identifying a white person as black: P(B|not A) = 20% (from information b)
4. Prior probability of the attacker being white: P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 85% (from information a)
5. Probability of the witness identifying a white person as black: P(B|not A) = 20% (from information b)

Now, we can calculate the probability of event B (the witness's identification) given event A (the attacker being black):

P(B|A) = (P(A|B) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12%. This estimate is significantly lower than the witness's identification (80%), indicating that the witness may have made an error in the identification. However, it's important to note that the actual probability could be higher or lower due to factors not accounted for in this analysis.
