The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) is equal to the probability of a false negative (identifying a black person as white).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. The witness's error rate of 20% means that for every 100 people they identify, they will make 20 mistakes. Since the attacker's race is unknown, the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is white is the same as the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is white. Since 85% of the population is white, there are 85 white people for every 100 people. The witness will correctly identify 85 * 0.8 = 72 white people and make mistakes on 85 * 0.2 = 17 white people. So the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is white is 17/85 = 0.1933.

Now let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black. Since 15% of the population is black, there are 15 black people for every 100 people. The witness will correctly identify 15 * 0.8 = 12 black people and make mistakes on 15 * 0.2 = 3 black people. So the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black is 3/15 = 0.2.

Since the error rate is the same for both white and black attackers, we can assume that the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black is equal to 0.1933. The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, and then multiply that by the probability of the attacker being black to get our final estimate:

Probability of witness making correct identification given attacker is black = 0.8
Probability of attacker being black = 0.15
Estimate of probability that attacker is black = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
