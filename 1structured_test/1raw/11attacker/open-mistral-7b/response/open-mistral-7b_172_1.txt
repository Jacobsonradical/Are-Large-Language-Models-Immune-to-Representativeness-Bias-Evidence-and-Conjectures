Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% under similar conditions, and they err 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white 20% of the time.
2. So, if the attacker was white, the witness would have incorrectly identified him as black only 20% of the time.
3. However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 (the attacker being black) minus the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identified him as black:
   Probability(Attacker is Black) = 1 - Probability(Attacker is White and Witness Mistake)

5. The probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black by the witness is 0.2 (based on the witness's accuracy).
6. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of randomly picking a white person is 0.85 and the probability of picking a black person is 0.15.
7. The probability of the attacker being white and the witness mistakenly identifying him as black is therefore:
   Probability(Attacker is White and Witness Mistake) = Probability(Attacker is White) * Probability(Witness Mistake)

8. Plugging in the values:
   Probability(Attacker is White and Witness Mistake) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

9. So, the probability that the attacker is black is:
   Probability(Attacker is Black) = 1 - Probability(Attacker is White and Witness Mistake)
   Probability(Attacker is Black) = 1 - 0.17
   Probability(Attacker is Black) = 0.83

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83, or 83%.
