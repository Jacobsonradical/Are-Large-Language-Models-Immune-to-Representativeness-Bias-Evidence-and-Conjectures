Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's statement about the attacker's race is considered an error if it contradicts the population composition of the city. In this case, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, it would be an error 85% of the time (given that 85% of the population is white).

On the other hand, if the witness identifies the attacker as white, it would be an error 15% of the time (given that 15% of the population is black).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is the opposite of the probability of making an error. So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black correctly (given that they actually are black) is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

However, we need to account for the witness's error rate. The actual probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the true proportion of black people in the population.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.85 * 0.15) = 0.1275 or approximately 12.75%.
