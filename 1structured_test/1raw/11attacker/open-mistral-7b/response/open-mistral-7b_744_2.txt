Given the information provided, the population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness with an error rate of 20% in identifying race correctly under similar conditions identified the attacker as black.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)]

First, let's calculate P(Witness identification | Attacker is black):
Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Next, let's calculate P(Witness identification | Attacker is white):
Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.20. However, since the population is predominantly white (85%), the probability of a white attacker being misidentified as black is actually higher than that of a black attacker being misidentified as white. We can calculate this probability by multiplying the probability of a white attacker with the probability of misidentification, which is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

Now, let's calculate P(Attacker is black) and P(Attacker is white):
P(Attacker is black) = 0.15
P(Attacker is white) = 0.85

Finally, we can calculate P(Attacker is black | Witness identification):
P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

The estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.56, or 56%. This means that based on the witness's identification and the given population distribution, there is a slightly higher likelihood that the attacker is black than white. However, keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the given information and may not accurately reflect the true probability in reality.
