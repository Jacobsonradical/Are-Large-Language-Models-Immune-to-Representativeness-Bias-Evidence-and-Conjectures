Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: 1) The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. 2) The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important discrepancy between the two pieces of information. The witness identified the attacker as black, yet we know that the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, the first piece of information about the racial demographics of the city is not directly relevant to this case.

The only relevant information is the witness's ability to correctly identify race, which we can use to make an estimate. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that there's a 20% chance that they misidentified the attacker's race. This means that there's an 80% chance that they correctly identified the attacker's race.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and considering their 80% accuracy rate, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8 (80%). However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's ability to identify race, not on the actual race of the attacker, which remains unknown due to the victim's inability to see.
