Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not always accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we cannot definitively say whether the witness made an error in this particular instance, we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is black and the witness was correct, and the attacker is white and the witness was wrong.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

a) Probability of Attacker being Black and Witness being Correct:
The probability of an attacker being black is 15% (from the population data). Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, this means the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

b) Probability of Attacker being White and Witness being Wrong:
The probability of an attacker being white is 85% (from the population data). Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this means the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since we cannot discount either scenario, we need to add their probabilities to get a total estimate:

Total Probability = Probability of Attacker being Black and Witness being Correct + Probability of Attacker being White and Witness being Wrong
Total Probability = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%)

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 29%. Again, this is an estimate and could be impacted by other factors not considered in this analysis.
