Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race. Since they incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is not black (given the witness's observations).

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white. This means that there's a higher probability of the attacker being white, given the racial demographics of the city.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the event that the attacker is black, and E is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:
- P(E|H) = 0.2 (given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a black person)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71
- P(E|not H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
- P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can then calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 (or 12%). However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and does not guarantee that the attacker is actually black.
