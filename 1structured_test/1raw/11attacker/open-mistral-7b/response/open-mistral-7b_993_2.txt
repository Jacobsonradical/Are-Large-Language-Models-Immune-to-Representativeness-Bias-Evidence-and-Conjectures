To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time.
2. The demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the witness encounters a person randomly in the city. Since the city has a white population of 85%, the chance of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85. The chance of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15.

Given the witness's reliability, the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%). The probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's identification. This probability is the ratio of the probability of correctly identifying a black person to the sum of the probabilities of correctly and incorrectly identifying a black person:

(0.12) / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8, or 80%. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different in reality.
