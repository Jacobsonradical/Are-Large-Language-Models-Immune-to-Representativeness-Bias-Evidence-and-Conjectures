Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness made a correct identification or an error in this specific case.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is 15%. However, since we don't have information about the witness's error in this specific case, we cannot adjust that probability based on the witness's reliability.

So, strictly answering the question based on the given information:
{probability: 0.15, the attacker is 15% likely to be black}
