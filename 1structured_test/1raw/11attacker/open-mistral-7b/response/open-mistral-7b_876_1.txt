To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correct identifications) and the error rate is 20% (mistakes). Since we don't have any information about the actual racial composition of the group the witness observed, we'll assume a 50-50 split between white and black people for simplicity.

1. In a scenario where the attacker is actually white, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time.
2. In a scenario where the attacker is actually black, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black 80% of the time.

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so we can only consider the second scenario. The probability of this scenario occurs 80% of the time, given the witness's reliability.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
