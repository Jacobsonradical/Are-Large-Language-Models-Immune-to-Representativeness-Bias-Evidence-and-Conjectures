To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population. The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. The racial composition of the population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the witness errs as P(error).

Given the witness's reliability, we know that P(error) = 0.2.

If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(black):

P(black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) \* P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness says black)]

We're given P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (15%), P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (80% reliability), and P(witness says black) = P(attacker is black) \* P(witness says black | attacker is black) + P(error) \* P(attacker is not black)

Since 85% of the population is white, P(attacker is not black) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(black) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating this expression, we find that P(black) â‰ˆ 0.292 or 29.2%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population, is approximately 29.2%.
