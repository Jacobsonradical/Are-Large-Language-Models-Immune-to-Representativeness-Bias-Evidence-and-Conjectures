Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying race, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the attacker is actually black in the population is 15%. However, the witness's mistake rate means that there is a chance that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black (Type I error).

On the other hand, there's also a chance that the witness correctly identified a black person but mistakenly believed they saw a white person (Type II error).

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's statement, we need to consider both types of errors. Let's assume that the attacker is actually white (to calculate the probability of a Type I error). The probability of a Type I error is then the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now, let's assume that the attacker is actually black (to calculate the probability of a Type II error). The probability of a Type II error is then the probability that the witness correctly identifies other white people as white but mistakenly believes they saw a black person. Given the information, we don't have enough data to calculate this directly. However, we can use the witness's overall error rate (20%) as an approximation.

Since the attacker is black, the probability of a Type II error is then 0.2 (20%).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is therefore the sum of the probabilities of not making any error and making a Type II error:

Probability = 0 (probability of not making any error, which is unlikely given the witness's error rate) + 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black) + 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.2 (probability of the witness making a Type II error)

However, as mentioned, the calculation of the probability of a Type II error requires more information. With the given information, we can only estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's overall error rate:

{probability: 0.43, this is an estimate based on the witness's overall error rate of 20%}
