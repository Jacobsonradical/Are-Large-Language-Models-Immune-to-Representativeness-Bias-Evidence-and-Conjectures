Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not reliable in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness's mistake was in this case or if they correctly identified the attacker as black, we cannot use the witness's statement alone to determine the race of the attacker.

The probability that the attacker is black based on the city's demographics is 15%, but this does not take into account the witness's error rate or the reliability of their identification. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
