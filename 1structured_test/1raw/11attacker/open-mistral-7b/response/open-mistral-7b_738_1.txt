To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this counts as an error.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(black). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 1 - 0.8 (since they correctly identify whites 80% of the time), which is 0.2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.8.

Given the witness's statement, we can set up an equation:

P(witness says black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black)

Substituting the given values, we have:

0.8 (the witness's statement) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.12 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.43 (or 43%). This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability.
