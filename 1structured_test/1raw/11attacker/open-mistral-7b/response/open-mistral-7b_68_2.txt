Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that provides a way to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's observation).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H represents the attacker being black, E represents the witness's observation, and we are interested in P(H|E).

P(E|H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified 80% of black people).
P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we need to estimate based on the city's population. Since 15% of the city's population is black, P(H) = 0.15.
P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's observation), which is a mixture of P(E|H) and P(E|not H). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|not H) = 0.2. However, we don't have the prior probability of the attacker not being black (P(not H)) to calculate P(E).

To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Since we don't have P(not H), we cannot calculate the exact probability of the evidence. However, we can use the given information to estimate P(E). Since 85% of the city's population is white, P(not H) = 0.85. Therefore, P(E) is approximately 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21.

Since we cannot calculate P(E) precisely, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate for P(H|E) according to the given information. However, we can still provide a qualitative answer based on the relative sizes of P(E|H) and P(E).

Given that P(E|H) > P(E), it is more likely that the attacker is black given the witness's observation than it is that the attacker is not black given the same observation, despite the uncertainties in the exact probabilities. Therefore, we can conservatively estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.8, but less than 1.0.
