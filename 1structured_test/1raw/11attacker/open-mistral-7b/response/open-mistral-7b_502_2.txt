To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is truly black is the probability the witness is correct, which is 0.8 (80%).

On the other hand, if the witness identified the attacker as black but the attacker is actually white, this would be an error. The probability of such an error is the probability the witness is incorrect, which is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black (as stated in the second piece of information), we can assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is lower than 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate) but higher than 0.15 (the racial composition of the city).

To find an estimate of this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(A|B) is our estimate, P(B|A) is the witness's correct identification rate (0.8), P(A) is the actual probability of the attacker being black (which we are trying to estimate), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is a weighted average of P(A) and the probability of the witness erring, P(not A|B) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.03)

Solving this equation for P(A|B) gives us an estimate of 0.61.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.61 (61%).
