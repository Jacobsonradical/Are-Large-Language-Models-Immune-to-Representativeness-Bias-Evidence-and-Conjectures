Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. In the general population of the city, 85% are white and 15% are black.
2. However, the witness's ability to accurately judge race is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given these facts, we need to account for both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate. If the attacker was actually white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. So, we need to consider both the probability that the attacker is black in the general population (15%) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20%).

The probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them is 15%. The probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black is 85% * 20% = 17%.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 15% + 17% = 32%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.32}
