To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, and it allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to estimate)
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the first piece of information)
P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the first piece of information)
P(A|B) as the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black
P(~A|B) as the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is not black

Given that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is independent of the race of the attacker, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|~A) = 0.2

Also, given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black (as stated in the second piece of information), we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the prior probability)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.1562

So, based on the witness's testimony and the information about the city's population, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.62%.
