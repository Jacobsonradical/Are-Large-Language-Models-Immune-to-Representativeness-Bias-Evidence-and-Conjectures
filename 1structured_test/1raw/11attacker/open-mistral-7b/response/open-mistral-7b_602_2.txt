To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errores 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black.

If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as black is 0.2 (20%).

However, since we don't have information about the probability of the attacker being white, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to infer the probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is calculated as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We know P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black) is 0.8 (80%).
We also know P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black) and P(B) (the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black) from the given information.

However, we don't have information about P(A) and P(B) to directly calculate P(A|B). Therefore, we cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format.

To provide an estimate, we can assume that the attacker's race is equally likely to be black or white. In this case, P(A) = 0.5.

The probability of the witness identifying a random person as black is P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.667 (66.7%).
