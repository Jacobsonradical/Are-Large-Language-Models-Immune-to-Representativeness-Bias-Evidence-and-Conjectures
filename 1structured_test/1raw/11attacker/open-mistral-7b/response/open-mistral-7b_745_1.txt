Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   - P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% from city demographics)
   - P(B) is the observed evidence (witness's identification of the attacker as black)
   - P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness making this observation given that the attacker is black (80% accuracy)
   - P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white (1 - 15% = 85%)
   - P(~B|A) is the likelihood of the witness making this observation given that the attacker is white (20% error rate)

Calculating these probabilities, we get:

- P(A) = 0.15
- P(B) = 0.8 (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(~A) = 0.85
- P(~B|A) = 0.2

Applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18%.
