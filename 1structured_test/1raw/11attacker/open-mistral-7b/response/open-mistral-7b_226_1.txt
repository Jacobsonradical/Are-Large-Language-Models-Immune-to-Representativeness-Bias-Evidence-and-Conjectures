Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated by considering the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness misidentified the race of the attacker. Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, if the witness had made a random guess, they would have correctly identified the attacker as white 85% of the time and erred 15% of the time.

Since the witness's identification was incorrect, it's more likely that they erred in this case rather than guessing correctly given the racial demographics of the city. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness erring, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis and does not take into account other factors that might influence the witness's identification, such as lighting conditions, distance, or the attacker's clothing. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as a rough approximation.
