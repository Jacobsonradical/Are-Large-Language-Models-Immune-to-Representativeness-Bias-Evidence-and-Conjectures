To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's racial identification has an error rate of 20%. This means that when presented with a random person from the city, they will incorrectly identify the person's race 20% of the time.

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker were actually white, the witness would have a 20% chance of erring and identifying the attacker as black. But since the witness did identify the attacker as black, we can infer that the attacker's race is more likely to be black than white.

Let's calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

We are given that:
- P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies white people 20% of the time)
- P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(Attacker is White) = 0.85

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.164 = 0.7347

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.735 (or 73.5%). This means that, based on this information, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black.
