To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, with an error rate of 20%. However, due to the nature of the statement, we cannot directly apply this percentage to the city's population without knowing the exact context. The witness's accuracy might not be representative of the city's population, especially if the witness has a bias or if the lighting conditions were different.

Given that we have no additional information, the most conservative approach would be to assume that the witness's error rate applies equally to both races. In this case, if the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, that means they are correct 80% of the time for both white and black individuals.

Since 85% of the city's population is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can estimate that the attacker is white about 72% of the time (0.85 * 0.8 = 0.72). Therefore, the attacker is black about 28% of the time (1 - 0.72 = 0.28).

However, the witness's statement suggests that they are more accurate in identifying black individuals (80% vs 72% for white individuals). If we assume that this accuracy differential is due to a bias towards identifying black individuals, then the attacker might be black more often than our initial estimate.

Without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive probability. Therefore, the best answer we can provide is:

{probability: 0.28, note: This is a conservative estimate based on the assumption that the witness's error rate applies equally to both races. A more optimistic estimate, considering the witness's bias towards identifying black individuals, could be higher.}
