To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence. The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering any evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

First, let's calculate P(E|H). Given that the witness is 80% accurate in identifying black people, this means that when the attacker is actually black, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H). Since we have no prior information about the attacker's race, we can assume that before the attack, the probability of the attacker being black is the same as in the general population. According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(E). This is the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is 80% accurate in identifying black people and 100% accurate in identifying white people, the probability of making the identification is equal to the sum of the probability of making the identification when the attacker is black and the probability of making the identification when the attacker is white.

The probability of making the identification when the attacker is black is P(E|H) = 0.8, and the probability of making the identification when the attacker is white is 1 (since the witness is 100% accurate in identifying white people). Since there are 85% white people and 15% black people, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.85 = 0.97.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.123

So, based on the evidence of the witness's identification and the general population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12.3%. This is a significant decrease from the 15% probability before considering any evidence. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer. The actual probability could be higher or lower, depending on other factors that might not be accounted for in this analysis.
