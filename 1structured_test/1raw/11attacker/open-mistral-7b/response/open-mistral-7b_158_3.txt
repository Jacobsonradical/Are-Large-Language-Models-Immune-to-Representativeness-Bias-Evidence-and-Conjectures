Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, saw the attacker and identified them as black with a 80% success rate.

Since we cannot know for certain if the witness was correct this time, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is black and the witness was correct, and the attacker is white and the witness was incorrect.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

a) Probability that the attacker is black and the witness was correct:
   P(attacker is black and witness is correct) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness is correct given attacker is black)
   = 0.15 * 0.8
   = 0.12

b) Probability that the attacker is white and the witness was incorrect:
   P(attacker is white and witness is incorrect) = P(attacker is white) * P(witness is incorrect given attacker is white)
   = 0.85 * 0.2
   = 0.17

Now, we add these probabilities to find the total probability of the witness's identification being correct:

Total probability of witness's identification = P(attacker is black and witness is correct) + P(attacker is white and witness is incorrect)
                                                            = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                            = 0.29

Since the witness's identification has a total probability of 29%, and the witness identified the attacker as black, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 29%.

{probability: 0.29}
