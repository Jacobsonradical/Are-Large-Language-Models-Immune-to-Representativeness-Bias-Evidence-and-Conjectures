Given the information provided, we have a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

However, since the witness's error rate is not specific to identifying black individuals versus white individuals, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to this situation. The witness's overall accuracy rate of 80% is based on a 50-50 split of white and black individuals, which is not the case in the city where the attack occurred.

Therefore, without more specific information about the witness's accuracy rate when identifying black individuals, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
