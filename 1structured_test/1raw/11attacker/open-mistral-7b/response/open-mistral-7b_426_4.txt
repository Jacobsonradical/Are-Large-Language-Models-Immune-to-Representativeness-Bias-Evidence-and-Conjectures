To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence. The formula is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E | H), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have:

P(E | H) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H), which is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate this as:

P(H) = 0.15

Now, let's calculate P(E), which is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of whether they are actually black or white. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, we can calculate this as:

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)

Where P(E | not H) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are actually white, and P(not H) is the probability that the attacker is white. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we have:

P(E | not H) = 0.2
P(not H) = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now, we can calculate P(H | E), which is our estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
