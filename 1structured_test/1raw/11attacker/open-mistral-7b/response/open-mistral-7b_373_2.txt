Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's description of the attacker as black

We have two pieces of information:
1) The prior probability of H, P(H), which can be estimated from the population demographics: P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
2) The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), which is given as 0.8 by the witness's reliability: P(E|H) = 0.8
3) The likelihood of E given not H, P(E|not H), which is given as 0.2 by the witness's reliability: P(E|not H) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

P(not H) is the complement of P(H), so P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Plugging in the values we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the reliability of the witness, which is only 80% accurate under similar conditions. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not accounted for in this analysis.
