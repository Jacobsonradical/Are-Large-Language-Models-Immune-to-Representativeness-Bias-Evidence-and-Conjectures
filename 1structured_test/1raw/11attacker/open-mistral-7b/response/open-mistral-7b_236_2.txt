Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. The prior probability of A (the attacker being black) is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. The probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 80%.
3. The probability of B given not A (the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black) is 1 minus the probability of B given A, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. The witness's error rate in identifying race is 20%.
4. The probability of not A (the attacker being white) is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
5. The probability of not B given not A (the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black when he is white) is also 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us an estimate of 0.24, or 24%. This means that, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, there is a 24% probability that the attacker is black.
