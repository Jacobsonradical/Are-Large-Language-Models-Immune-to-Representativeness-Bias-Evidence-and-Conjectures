To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

a) The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified him as black.
b) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified him.

Let's calculate the probabilities for these two scenarios:

a) The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white is 20% (the error rate). Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of scenario a is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

b) The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 80% (the correct identification rate). Since only 15% of the population is black, the probability of scenario b is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness reported the attacker as black. This means that scenario b is a success, while scenario a is a failure. Therefore, we should subtract the probability of scenario a from 1 to get the probability of scenario b:

1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%

So, our final estimate, based on both the population distribution and the witness's reliability, is that the attacker is black with a probability of 83%.
