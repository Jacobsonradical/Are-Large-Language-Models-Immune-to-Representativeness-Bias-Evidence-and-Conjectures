To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness only identified the attacker as black, so their error rate does not apply here. This means that when the witness is correct, they are identifying a black person.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and the city's population is as described, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, the attacker is likely 12% black}

However, the witness also stated that they were correct 80% of the time. If we take this statement at face value, it suggests that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when they say a person is black. This contradicts the information that they correctly identified the attacker as black.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information. The witness's reliability is either overstated or the attacker was not correctly identified as black.
