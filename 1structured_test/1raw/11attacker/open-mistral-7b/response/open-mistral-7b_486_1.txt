To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The witness's accuracy in identifying races can be represented as a conditional probability P(witness said black | attacker is black) = 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the witness saying black when the attacker is white is P(witness said black | attacker is white) = 0.2.

According to the witness, the attacker was identified as black. However, we cannot directly use this information because of the possibility of the witness's error. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(black | witness said black) = [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(black)] / [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) * P(white)]

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we have P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(black | witness said black):

P(black | witness said black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12, or 12%.
