To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we should weigh the witness's identification by their accuracy.

If we assume that the witness's identification is correct, then the attacker is indeed black with a probability of 1. However, we know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect and the attacker is actually white is 0.2 (20%).

If the witness is incorrect, then the attacker must be white. Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white given an incorrect identification is 0.85.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = P(Witness is correct) * P(Attacker is black | Witness is correct) + P(Witness is incorrect) * P(Attacker is white | Witness is incorrect)

= 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.8 + 0.17
= 0.97

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant across all races, which may not be the case. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it's possible that their error rate for identifying black people is higher than 20%. If this is the case, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be lower.

{probability: 0.97, please note that this estimate assumes a constant error rate and might be too high if the witness's error rate for identifying black people is higher than 20%}
