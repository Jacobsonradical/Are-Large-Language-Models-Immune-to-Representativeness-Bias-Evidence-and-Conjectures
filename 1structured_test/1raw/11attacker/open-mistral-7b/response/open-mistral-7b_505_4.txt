To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, we can start by assuming that the attacker is more likely to be white. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black introduces uncertainty.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct and a 0.2 probability that the witness was incorrect.

Since the attacker is more likely to be white, if the witness was incorrect, the attacker is more likely to be white. Conversely, if the witness was correct, the attacker is more likely to be black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated by multiplying the probability that the witness was correct by the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness was correct, and then subtracting this product from 1, to account for the probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is white:

P(Attacker is black) = P(Witness was correct) * P(Attacker is black | Witness was correct) + P(Witness was incorrect) * P(Attacker is black | Witness was incorrect)

P(Witness was correct) = 0.8
P(Attacker is black | Witness was correct) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black)
P(Attacker is black | Witness was incorrect) = P(Attacker is black | Witness saw a white person) = 0 (since the attacker is assumed to be white if the witness was incorrect)
P(Attacker is white | Witness was incorrect) = 1 (since the attacker is assumed to be white if the witness was incorrect)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
