Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. E: The attacker is black.
2. O: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

The probability of event E (the attacker is black) is what we want to estimate, and the probability of event O (the witness identifies the attacker as black) is given by the witness's ability to judge race.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(E|O) = [P(O|E) * P(E)] / [P(O)]

1. P(O|E) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.80.
2. P(E) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
3. P(O) is the probability of the witness making the observation O, regardless of the truth of E. This can be calculated as the sum of P(O|E) * P(E) and P(O|not E) * P(not E), where P(O|not E) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black, and P(not E) is the probability that the attacker is not black.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(not E) = 0.85 and P(E) = 0.15.

The probability P(O|not E) can be calculated using the witness's error rate. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(O|not E) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(O):
P(O) = P(O|E) * P(E) + P(O|not E) * P(not E)
P(O) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(O) = 0.12 + 0.1725
P(O) = 0.2925

Now we can estimate P(E|O):
P(E|O) = [P(O|E) * P(E)] / P(O)
P(E|O) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2925
P(E|O) â‰ˆ 0.343

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.343 or 34.3%.
