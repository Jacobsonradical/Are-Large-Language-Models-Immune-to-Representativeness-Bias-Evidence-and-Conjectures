Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial demographics of the city (85% white and 15% black) and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

The witness's ability to identify race correctly is 80% and incorrectly is 20%. However, it's important to note that the witness identified the attacker as black, which means the witness made a correct identification in this case.

The witness's correct identification occurs 80% of the time when the person is actually black. Since we don't have any information suggesting that the witness is more likely to make a correct identification when the person is white, we can assume that the probability of a correct identification is 80% in both cases (white and black).

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, this event occurred when the attacker was actually black. So, the probability of this event (the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the probability of the attacker being black times the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified the attacker as black when the attacker was actually white. This event occurs with a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since we only have information about one event (the attacker being identified as black), we cannot directly compute the probability that the attacker is black based on this event alone. To do so, we would need additional information, such as the actual number of correct and incorrect identifications made by the witness.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. However, the witness's correct identification suggests that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, given the racial demographics of the city.
