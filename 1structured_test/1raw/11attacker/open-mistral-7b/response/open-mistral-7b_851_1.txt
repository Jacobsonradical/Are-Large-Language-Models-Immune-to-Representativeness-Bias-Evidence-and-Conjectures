Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The overall racial distribution of the city's population. According to information "a", 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

2. The reliability of the witness's race identification under poor light conditions. According to information "b", the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we don't have any information about whether the witness's identification of the attacker as black was correct or not. Given the witness's error rate, it's possible that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black.

Since we can't determine the attacker's race based on the witness's identification alone, we cannot provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The available information is not sufficient to make a probability calculation.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: undetermined, please provide a number between 0 and 1, but it cannot be provided based on the provided information}
