Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we do not have direct evidence of the witness's accuracy in this specific case. The witness identified the attacker as black, but we don't know if this was a correct identification or an error.

The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. This information can be used to make an educated guess, but it's not the same as having accurate identification from a reliable witness.

Given the lack of direct evidence and the uncertainty introduced by the witness's reliability, it would not be appropriate to provide a precise probability estimate. Instead, I would suggest that further investigation is needed to establish the attacker's race with more certainty.
