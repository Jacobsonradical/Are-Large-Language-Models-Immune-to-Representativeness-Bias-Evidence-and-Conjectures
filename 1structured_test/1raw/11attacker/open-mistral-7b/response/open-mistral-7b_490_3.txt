To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence,
- P(H | E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence,
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

Let's break down the given information to calculate these probabilities:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we have no prior information, we can assume it to be equal to the population proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

2. P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the evidence is the witness's testimony that the attacker is black. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. So, P(E | H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was actually black).

3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence, regardless of the hypothesis. Since there are two possible hypotheses (attacker is black or attacker is white), we need to consider both. Let's denote P(E | H1) as the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is white and P(E | H2) as the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is black. Since the witness's accuracy is the same regardless of the race, P(E | H1) = P(E | H2) = 0.8 (when the person is white, the witness incorrectly identifies the race 80% of the time, but this still counts as evidence that the attacker is not black).

The probability of the evidence P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis:

P(E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) + P(E | H2) * P(H2)

We can simplify this to:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)

P(H | E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15)

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, based on the given information and assuming the witness's testimony is accurate, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24%.
