To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)], where ~H denotes the complementary hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

From the information provided, we know:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(H) is what we want to find

We don't have a direct value for P(E|~H), but we can use the fact that the witness makes errors 20% of the time. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
