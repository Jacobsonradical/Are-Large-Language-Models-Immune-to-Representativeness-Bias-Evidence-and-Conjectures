To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two races (white and black), then we can calculate the probability of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) and the probability of a false negative (identifying a black person as white).

The probability of a false positive (P(FP)) is the probability of erring times the probability of the erring being a white person. Since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% of the population is white, the probability of erring and it being a white person is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of a false negative (P(FN)) is the probability of erring times the probability of erring being a black person. Since the witness errs 20% of the time and 15% of the population is black, the probability of erring and it being a black person is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (P(TP)) as 1 - P(FP) - P(FN) = 1 - 0.17 - 0.03 = 0.80.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the event we want to estimate the probability of is the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying him as black. This probability is equal to P(TP) = 0.80.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.80}. This means that, given the information provided, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is black. However, it is important to note that this estimate relies on several assumptions, and other factors not considered in this analysis could potentially influence the actual probability.
