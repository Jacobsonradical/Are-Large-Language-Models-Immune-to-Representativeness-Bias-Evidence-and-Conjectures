Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's description.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness described the attacker as black

The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is the witness's success rate in identifying black people, which is 0.8 (or 80%). The probability of the hypothesis given no evidence (P(H)) is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Here, ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is white, and P(E|~H) is the witness's error rate in identifying black people as white, which is 0.2 (or 20%). P(~H) is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Now, we can compute the probability that the attacker is black:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, based on the witness's description and the city's population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 16%.
