To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's description).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, we want to find P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description.

The evidence E is the witness's description of the attacker as black.

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black, given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)

We do not have direct information about P(E), the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black, but we can infer it based on P(E|H) and P(H). Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black when the attacker is white is 0.2 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.25. Therefore, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.25 * 0.85 = 0.22.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
         = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.22
         = 0.1818

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is 0.1818, or 18.18%. This means that, based on the information provided, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black, but the evidence is not strong enough to rule out the possibility that the attacker is black.
