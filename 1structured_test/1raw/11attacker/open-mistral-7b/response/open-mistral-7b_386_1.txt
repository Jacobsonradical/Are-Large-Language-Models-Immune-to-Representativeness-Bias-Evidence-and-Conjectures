Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- A is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- B is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying a black person when they are actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (proportion of black people in the population)
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence (overall accuracy of the witness in identifying race)

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was actually black)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.7 (overall accuracy of the witness in identifying race)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
         = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.7
         = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate is based on the witness's accuracy in this specific case, and it might not necessarily reflect the true probability of the attacker's race. It would be more accurate to conduct a more comprehensive investigation to obtain more reliable evidence.
