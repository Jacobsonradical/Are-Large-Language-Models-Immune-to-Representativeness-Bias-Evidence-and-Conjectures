To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the person (which is a simplifying assumption), then the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a black person as white is 20%.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of randomly selecting a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is therefore 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Given this, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12, or 12%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12}.
