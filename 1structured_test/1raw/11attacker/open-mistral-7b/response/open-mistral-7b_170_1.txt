The probability estimate would be based on the reliability of the witness's race identification and the city's demographic data.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can consider this as the true probability of an attacker being black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% (or 0.8) when looking at a half-half mix of white and black people.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error in identification. In this case, the attacker is likely white, given the city's demographic data.

Given the witness's error rate of 20% (or 0.2), there is a 0.2 probability that the witness made an error, meaning the attacker is likely white.

However, we should consider both scenarios and their probabilities to get a more accurate estimate. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race (scenario 1) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error (scenario 2) is 0.2.

The probability estimate of the attacker being black would be the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios, weighted by their respective outcomes:

0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 1 (outcome if correct) + 0.2 (probability of error) * 0 (outcome if error) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
