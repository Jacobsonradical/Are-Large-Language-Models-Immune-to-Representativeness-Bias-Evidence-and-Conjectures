Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness made an error in this case, meaning they incorrectly identified the attacker as black. If this is the case, then the actual attacker must be white (given that 85% of the population is white).

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability that they made an error in this case is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white, given that the witness identified them as black, is 0.20.

However, since we know the racial demographics of the city, we can also calculate the probability that the attacker is black directly.

Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.

Given the information, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, while the probability that they are white, given that the witness identified them as black, is 0.20. However, since we know the racial demographics of the city, the overall probability that the attacker is black is more accurately 0.15. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15}.
