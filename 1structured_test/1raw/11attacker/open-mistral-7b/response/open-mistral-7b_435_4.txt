To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have the following information:
- P(E | H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which can be calculated from the total population statistics and the witness's error rate.

First, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)

Since we don't know P(¬H) (the prior probability of the attacker not being black), we can't directly calculate P(E). However, we do know the total population statistics and the witness's error rate, so we can calculate the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black (P(E | ¬H)).

P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time)

Now we can write P(E) as:

P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H))

Since we don't have a specific value for P(H), we can't directly calculate P(H | E). However, we can solve for P(H) given a value for P(H | E).

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Solving for P(H), we get:

P(H) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(H) = [0.8 * P(H)] / [0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H))]

We can't solve this equation directly for a specific value of P(H), but we can use numerical methods or approximation to find a solution.

Using numerical methods, we find that the value of P(H) that makes P(H | E) equal to the witness's estimate of 0.8 is approximately 0.2.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
