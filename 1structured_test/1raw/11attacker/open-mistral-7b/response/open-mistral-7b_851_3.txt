Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The general population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider the possibilities:
- If the attacker was white, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify him as black.
- If the attacker was black, there's a 80% chance the witness would correctly identify him as black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider both possibilities and their corresponding probabilities:
- If the attacker was white: P(attacker is white) * P(witness identifies white as black) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03
- If the attacker was black: P(attacker is black) * P(witness identifies black correctly) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race, is the sum of both possibilities: 0.03 + 0.12 = 0.15

However, the witness identified the attacker as black, so the probability we are interested in is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified him as black. This can be calculated by the ratio of the probability of the attacker being black to the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.8}

The attacker's probability of being black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
