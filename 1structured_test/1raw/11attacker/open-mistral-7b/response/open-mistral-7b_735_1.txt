Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the probability that a black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness (1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability of a black person in the population (0.15)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the likelihood of the witness identifying a person as black (0.8)

Using the formula, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.2) * (0.15) / (0.8) = 0.01875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 1.875% or 0.01875. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical estimate based on the given information and assumptions. In real-world applications, there may be other factors to consider and more complex models to use.
