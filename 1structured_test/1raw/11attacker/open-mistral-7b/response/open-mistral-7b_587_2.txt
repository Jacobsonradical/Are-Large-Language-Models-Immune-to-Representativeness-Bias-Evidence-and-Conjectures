To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black when they are actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability of the witness's testimony, regardless of the attacker's race)

Given the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.164 (the probability of the witness's testimony, regardless of the attacker's race)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.164 â‰ˆ 0.486

So, based on the witness's testimony and the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.486 or 48.6%.
