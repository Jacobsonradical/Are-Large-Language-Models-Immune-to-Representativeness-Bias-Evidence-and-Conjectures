Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (probability that the witness makes this identification)

Given the information in the problem, we can substitute the values into the formula:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

We know that P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
We know that P(H) = 0.15 (85% of city population is white, so 15% is black)
We also know that P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (probability of this particular identification)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.5 or 50%. This means that there is an equal likelihood that the attacker is black or white, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city.

However, it's important to note that this estimation assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is unaffected by the dark conditions at night, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. If the witness's ability to judge race is less reliable in low light conditions, the probability of the attacker being black could be lower than 0.5.

Here's the answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.5}
