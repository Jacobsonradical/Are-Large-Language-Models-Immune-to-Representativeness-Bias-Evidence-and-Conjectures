To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen, there's a chance that the witness could have made an error in identifying the attacker as black.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is 0.20, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.80.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black (P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black)) can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = P(Witness correctly identifies Attacker as Black) / (P(Witness correctly identifies Attacker as Black) + P(Witness incorrectly identifies Attacker as Black))

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 0% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1.0.

Then, P(Witness correctly identifies Attacker as Black) = 0.80

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20, so P(Witness incorrectly identifies Attacker as Black) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.17) = 0.815

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.815 or 81.5%.
