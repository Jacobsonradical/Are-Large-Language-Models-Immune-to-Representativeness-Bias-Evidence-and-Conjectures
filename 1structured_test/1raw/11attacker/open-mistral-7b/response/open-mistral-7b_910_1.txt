Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker being black or white in this specific case, we can use the witness's error rate as our uncertainty.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, if the attacker was white, the witness would have a 85% chance of correctly identifying him or her as white and a 15% chance of incorrectly identifying him or her as black.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that when the witness is incorrect, they are more likely to mistake a white person as black than the other way around. This is because there are more white people in the population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, can be estimated as the error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%. However, this is an estimate based on the witness's past performance and not necessarily reflective of the actual case. It's important to note that this estimate does not take into account any other evidence or factors that might be relevant to the case.
