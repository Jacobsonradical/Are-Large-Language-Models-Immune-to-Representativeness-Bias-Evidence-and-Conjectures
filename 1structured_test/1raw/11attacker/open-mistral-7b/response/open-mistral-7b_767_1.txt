Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

1. The city's population demographics: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate (20%) is based on a different population ratio (50% white and 50% black), which is not representative of the city's actual population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we could consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The witness's error rate is directly applicable to the city's demographics. In this case, the attacker being identified as black by the witness would imply that the witness was correct, and the attacker is indeed black. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black would be equal to the witness's correct identification rate: 0.8 (or 80%).

Scenario 2: The witness's error rate is not directly applicable to the city's demographics. In this case, we would need more information to estimate the probability. For example, we would need to know the likelihood of the witness making an error in this specific situation (given the city's demographics). Without this information, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate.

Given the information provided and the limitations of the data, the most conservative estimate would be based on Scenario 1: {probability: 0.8, the attacker is black with 80% confidence based on the witness's correct identification rate}. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is directly applicable to the city's demographics, which may not be the case.
