To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white
- E as the error rate of the witness (1 - accuracy)

From the information given, we know that P(B) + P(W) = 1 and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B) + E * P(W) = 0.8.

We also know that 85% of the population is white, so P(W) = 0.85.

Substituting P(W) into the first equation, we get:

0.8 + E * 0.85 = 0.8

Simplifying the equation, we find that E = 0.15. This means the witness makes an error 15% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the error must have occurred when the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black. In this case, the probability of the witness making an error and identifying the attacker as black is E = 0.15.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is P(B) = 1 - E = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.85}
