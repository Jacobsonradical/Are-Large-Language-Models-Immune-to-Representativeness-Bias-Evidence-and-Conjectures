Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
2. 15% of the population in the city is black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the product of the witness's accuracy and the actual proportion of black people in the city.

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, so the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 12%}
