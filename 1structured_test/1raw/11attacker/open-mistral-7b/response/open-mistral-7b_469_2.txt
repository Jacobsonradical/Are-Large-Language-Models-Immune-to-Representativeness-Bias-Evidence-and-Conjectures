Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct information about whether the witness made an accurate identification or an error in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's racial bias does not affect their identification of the attacker (which is not necessarily true, but we'll assume it for simplicity), then the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

However, due to the witness's inaccuracy, our certainty about this probability is reduced. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 80% chance that they were correct and a 20% chance that they made an error. If they made an error, then the attacker is likely white (given the city's population demographics).

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be a weighted average of these two possibilities, taking into account the likelihood of each. This requires a more complex calculation that involves the probabilities of both the witness being correct (0.8) and being incorrect (0.2), and the consequences of each.

Unfortunately, without more information, it's not possible to provide a precise number. However, a rough estimate based on the current information would be 15% (the city's black population proportion), but with significant uncertainty due to the witness's inaccuracy.
