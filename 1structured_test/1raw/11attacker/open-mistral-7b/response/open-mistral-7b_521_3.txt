Based on the provided information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population (85% white, 15% black).
2. The reliability of the witness's race identification (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

However, there's an important detail missing: we don't know the error rate of the witness when identifying black people specifically. Without this information, we can't directly apply the witness's error rate to the attacker's race.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a strict numerical estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
