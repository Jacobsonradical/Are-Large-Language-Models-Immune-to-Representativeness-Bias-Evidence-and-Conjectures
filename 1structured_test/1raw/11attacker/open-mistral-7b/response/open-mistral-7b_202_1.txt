Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows for the updating of probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (85% white, 15% black, so P(A) = 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (from part b, P(B|A) = 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (from part b, P(B|~A) = 0.2)
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (from part a, P(A) = 0.15, so P(~A) = 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the result, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
