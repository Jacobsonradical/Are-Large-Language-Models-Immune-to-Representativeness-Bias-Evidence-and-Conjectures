Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(E|H) is the probability that a witness would identify a black person as black, given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H) is the probability that a witness would identify a non-black person as black, given that the attacker is not black
- P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (where ~H represents the attacker being non-black)

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown, which we want to estimate
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.15 (Since 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.12P(H) + 0.03

We can now use Bayes' theorem to solve for P(H):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

P(H|E) = [0.8 * P(H)] / [0.12P(H) + 0.03]

To find P(H|E), we can solve for P(H) by rearranging the equation:

P(H) = [0.8 * P(H|E)] / [0.12P(H|E) + 0.03]

Solving for P(H|E) requires an iterative approach, such as Newton's method or bisection method, as the equation is nonlinear.

Using numerical methods, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.48.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%. However, it's important to note that this estimate relies on several assumptions, such as the witness's ability to accurately judge race under dim lighting conditions, and the representativeness of the sample of people used to assess the witness's accuracy. Therefore, this estimate should be taken as an approximation and not as a definitive result.
