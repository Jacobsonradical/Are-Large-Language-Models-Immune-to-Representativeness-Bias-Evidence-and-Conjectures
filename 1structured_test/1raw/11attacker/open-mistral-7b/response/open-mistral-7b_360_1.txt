Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race.
2. In the given population, 85% are white and 15% are black.
3. If we assume that the attacker is white, the probability of the witness getting it wrong (given the attacker is white) is 20%.
4. In this case, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as black, which means the attacker is actually white.
5. The probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's mistake, is the probability of a false positive (the witness identifying a white person as black).
6. To calculate this, we multiply the probability of the attacker being white by the probability of the witness making a mistake when the attacker is white: 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.20 (probability of witness error when attacker is white) = 0.17
7. However, since the witness also has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying black people, there's a chance that the attacker is black and the witness got it right.
8. The probability of the attacker being black and the witness getting it right is the probability of a true positive (the witness correctly identifying a black person as black).
9. To calculate this, we multiply the probability of the attacker being black by the probability of the witness getting it right when the attacker is black: 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.80 (probability of witness accuracy when attacker is black) = 0.12
10. To find the overall probability of the attacker being black, we add the probability of a true positive (0.12) to the probability of a false positive (0.17): 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
