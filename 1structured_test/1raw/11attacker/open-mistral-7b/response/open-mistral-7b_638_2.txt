Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The event that the attacker is black
- E: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being black (85% from information A)
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person (80% from information B)
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20% from information B)
- P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker being white (15% from information A)

The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black can be calculated as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(H) * P(E|H)] / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = (0.85 * 0.8) / ((0.85 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2))

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) = 0.626 / 0.626 + 0.030 = 0.626 / 0.656 â‰ˆ 0.952

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.952 or 95.2%.
