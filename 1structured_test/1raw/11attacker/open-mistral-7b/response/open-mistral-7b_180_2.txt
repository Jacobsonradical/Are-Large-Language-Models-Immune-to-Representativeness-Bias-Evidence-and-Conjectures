To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. This means that when the actual attacker is white, the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. Similarly, when the actual attacker is black, the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as white 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race. In this case, the probability is P(black).
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness made an error. In this case, the probability is 0.2 * P(white).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black))

Now let's use the information about the racial composition of the city:

P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.15

Solving this equation for P(black) gives:

P(black) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
P(black) â‰ˆ 0.125

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12.5%.
