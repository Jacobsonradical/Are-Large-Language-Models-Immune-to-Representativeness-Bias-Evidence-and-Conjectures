Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have direct information about how accurate the witness was in this specific case. The witness identified the attacker as black, but we don't know if this was a correct identification or an error.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This information might be relevant if we had more context, such as if we knew the attacker was likely to be from the city or if the city's demographics were representative of the population from which the attacker could have come.

However, without this additional information, we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's statement and the city's demographics. The witness's statement provides some evidence that the attacker might be black, but without knowing if this was a correct identification or an error, we cannot use it to calculate a probability.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a probability estimate.
