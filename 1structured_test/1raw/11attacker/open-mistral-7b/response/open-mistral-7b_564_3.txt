Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate, and the error rate is 20%.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the attacker's race, especially since the victim could not see the attacker's race. The witness's identification could be influenced by factors such as bias, prejudice, or uncertainty.

So, while we can use the demographic data and the witness's accuracy rate to make an estimate, it's important to recognize the limitations of this approach.

Given these limitations, a strict probability estimate based on the provided data would be difficult. However, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification if the attacker was indeed black, and the probability of the witness making a mistake if the attacker was white.

The probability of a black person in the city (P(Black)) is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time (0.8), so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is P(Witness correct | Black attacker) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of a white person in the city (P(White)) is 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time (0.2), so the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white attacker as black is P(Witness incorrect | White attacker) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the likelihood of a black attacker over a white attacker, a more conservative approach would be to assume that both types of attacks are equally likely. In this case, the total probability of a witness mistake would be the sum of both probabilities: P(Witness incorrect) = P(Witness incorrect | White attacker) + P(Witness incorrect | Black attacker) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of a witness mistake, which is 0.29. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not accurately reflect the true probability. It's crucial to consider other factors and evidence in a real-world investigation.
