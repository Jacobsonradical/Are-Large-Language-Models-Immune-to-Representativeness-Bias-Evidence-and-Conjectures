Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote the prior probability of a person being black as P(B), and the prior probability of a person being white as P(W) = 1 - P(B). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is L(B|Witness), and the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is L(W|Witness).

From the information provided, we know that P(B) = 0.15, P(W) = 0.85, L(B|Witness) = 0.8, and L(W|Witness) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|Witness) = [L(B|Witness) * P(B)] / [L(B|Witness) * P(B) + L(W|Witness) * P(W)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|Witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|Witness) = 0.12

So, based on the witness's statement and the known population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. This is significantly lower than the 15% population estimate, suggesting that the witness's statement may not be reliable in this case.
