To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the likelihood that the witness's identification is correct (given that the attacker is black) and the likelihood that the witness's identification is incorrect (given that the attacker is black).

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as P(correct|black) = 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as P(incorrect|black) = 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

We want to find the probability P(black) such that:

P(witness's identification is correct | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) = P(witness's identification is black)

The left side of the equation represents the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, and the right side represents the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as black, regardless of the attacker's race.

Substituting our calculated probabilities:

0.8 * P(black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.125

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
