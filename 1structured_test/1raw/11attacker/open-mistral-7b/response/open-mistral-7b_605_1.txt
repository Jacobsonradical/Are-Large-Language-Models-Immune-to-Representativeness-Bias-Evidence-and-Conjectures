Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's observation, is the probability of the witness being correct.

The probability of being correct is the probability of being black times the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, plus the probability of being white times the witness's error rate in identifying black people.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is white is 0.

So the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's observation, is:

0.1 * 0 + 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.64}
