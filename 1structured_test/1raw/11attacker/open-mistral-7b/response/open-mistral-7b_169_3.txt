The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the provided information, can be calculated as follows:

1. The population ratio of blacks to whites is 15% to 85%.
2. The witness has an accuracy rate of identifying races as 80% and an error rate of 20%.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To calculate the probability, we take into account both the population ratio and the witness's error rate. The witness's error rate means that there is a 20% chance that the witness misidentified the attacker's race. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker is 1 - the error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the population ratio of blacks to whites is 15% to 85%, the probability of a randomly selected attacker being black is 15% or 0.15.

Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the product of the population ratio and the witness's accuracy rate.

So, the probability estimate {probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12} or 12%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate does not depend on the actual race of the person. If the witness is more likely to err when identifying a person of a different race, then the probability estimate might be different. Also, this analysis does not take into account any other information that might be relevant to the case.
