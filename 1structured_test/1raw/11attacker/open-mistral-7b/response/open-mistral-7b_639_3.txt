Given the information provided, we can't make a definitive estimate based solely on the racial identification of the attacker by the witness. However, we can use the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population as a rough estimate.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 and the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15. If the witness's identification is correct, then the attacker must be black. So, the probability that the witness's identification is correct is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the true race of the attacker, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be viewed as a rough approximation only.
