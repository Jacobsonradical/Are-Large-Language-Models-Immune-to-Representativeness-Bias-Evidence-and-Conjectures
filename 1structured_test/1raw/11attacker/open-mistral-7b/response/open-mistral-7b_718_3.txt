Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we know that in reality, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

The witness's testimony could be a true reflection of the attacker's race (80% chance), or it could be an error (20% chance). Since we don't have any additional information that would allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities, we can only consider the probabilities given.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's testimony, is 0.8 (80%). However, it's important to note that this does not account for the possibility of racial bias in the witness's identification, or other factors that might have influenced their perception. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as a rough approximation, and further investigation may be necessary to draw more reliable conclusions.
