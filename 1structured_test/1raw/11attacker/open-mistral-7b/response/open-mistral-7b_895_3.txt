To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (population proportion of blacks)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

Given the information provided, we can calculate the values for each term in the formula:

1. P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
   P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
   P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
   P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 ≈ 0.48 or 48%

So, based on the witness's identification and the population proportion of blacks in the city, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 48%.
