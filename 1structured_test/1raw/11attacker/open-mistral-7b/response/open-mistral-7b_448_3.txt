To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to take into account the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (where ~B represents not black)

Given the information, we have:
1. P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (total probability)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying a black person)
3. P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying a non-black person)

We also know the population distribution: P(B) = 0.15 and P(~B) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is P(W|B) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black is P(W|~B) = 0.2.

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is a Bayes' theorem problem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.163

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 16.3%. This is significantly lower than the city's black population percentage, which suggests that the witness's identification may not be reliable in this case.
