Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given the occurrence of event B is given by the product of the probability of event B given A (P(B|A)) and the prior probability of A (P(A)), divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated using the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white (1 - 0.8 = 0.2) and the prior probability of the attacker being white (0.85). So, P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.21.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) (the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.524

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 52.4%.
