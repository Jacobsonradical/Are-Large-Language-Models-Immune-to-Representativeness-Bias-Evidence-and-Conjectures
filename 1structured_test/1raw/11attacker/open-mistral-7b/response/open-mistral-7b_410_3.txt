Given the two pieces of information, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so there's a possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(black). The probability that the witness errs and identifies a white person as black is P(white) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the witness made no error, and the probability that the attacker is white and the witness errs:

P(black) = P(identified as black and black) + P(identified as black and white)

P(identified as black and black) = P(black) * 0.8
P(identified as black and white) = P(white) * (1 - 0.8)

Substituting the given values:

P(black) = (P(black) * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2)

Solving this equation gives us:

P(black) = 0.12 + 0.003 = 0.123

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the reliability of the witness and the racial demographics, is approximately 12.3%.
