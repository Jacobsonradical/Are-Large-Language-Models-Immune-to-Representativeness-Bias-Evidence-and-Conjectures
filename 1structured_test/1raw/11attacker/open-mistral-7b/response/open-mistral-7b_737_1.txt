To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen, there is a 20% chance that the witness's identification is an error.

However, we also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If the witness's identification is correct, then the attacker must be black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given a correct identification by the witness is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).

The probability that the witness's identification is correct is 1 minus the probability that it's an error, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black is:

Probability = Probability of correct identification * Probability of black person given correct identification
                     = 0.80 * 0.15
                     = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
