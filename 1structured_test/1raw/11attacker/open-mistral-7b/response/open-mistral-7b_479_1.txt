Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the information, we know two probabilities:
1) P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the city's population is white, so 15% is black)
2) P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
3) P(E|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting our known probabilities, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Performing the calculations:
P(A|E) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.06]
P(A|E) = 0.12 / 0.18
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
