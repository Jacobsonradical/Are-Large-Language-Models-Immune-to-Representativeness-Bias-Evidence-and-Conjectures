Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population demographics in the city are 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's statement and population demographics).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifying a black person as black, or incorrectly identifying a white person as black).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (combination of witness's ability to identify race and population demographics).

First, let's calculate P(E|H). The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, and given the population demographics, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 85%, so P(E|H) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 1 * 0.15 = 0.28.

Next, let's calculate P(E). Since the witness's ability to identify race is 80% accurate, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. Therefore, P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 + 0.28 = 0.57.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Substituting the values we calculated earlier, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.28 * 0.15] / 0.57 â‰ˆ 0.19

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and population demographics, is approximately 19%.
