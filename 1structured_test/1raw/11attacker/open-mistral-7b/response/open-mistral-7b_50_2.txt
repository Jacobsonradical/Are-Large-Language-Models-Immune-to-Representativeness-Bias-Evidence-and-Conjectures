To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We have two pieces of information: the prior probability of H (P(H)), which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony, and the likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)), which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black.

We also have the prior probability of not H (P(not H)), which is the probability of the attacker being white before considering the witness's testimony, and the likelihood of E given not H (P(E|not H)), which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black if the attacker is white.

According to the problem, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time (P(E|H) = 0.8) and errs in 20% of the cases (P(E|not H) = 0.2). The population composition is given as 85% white and 15% black. So, P(H) = 0.15 and P(not H) = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H))

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

The calculated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48, or 48%.
