Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, this suggests that they believe the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8 (80%). However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness made an error. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

So, the total probability of the attacker being black, given both the witness's identification and the population statistics, is the probability of the witness being correct (0.8) plus the probability of the witness being incorrect and guessing correctly (0.17).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.97, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This means there is a 97% chance, based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics, that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this estimation relies on several assumptions and might not represent the actual situation due to limitations in the witness's ability to accurately identify race and other potential factors.
