To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's race identification under the specific conditions of the night attack.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

However, the witness's ability to identify race is not perfect. In the given sample, the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in their identification.

We know that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so the probability of scenario 1 is 0.8 (the proportion of correct identifications). The probability of scenario 2 is therefore 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the proportion of incorrect identifications).

Given that the attacker could be either black or white, we can calculate the probability of each scenario by multiplying the probability of the scenario by the probability of the attacker being that race.

Scenario 1 probability = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying race
                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                       = 0.12

Scenario 2 probability = Probability of attacker being white * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying race
                                       = 0.85 * 0.2
                                       = 0.17

Since we are looking for the probability that the attacker is black, we add the probabilities of both scenarios where the attacker is black:

Total probability of attacker being black = Scenario 1 probability + Scenario 2 probability * False Positive Probability
                                                          = 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.2
                                                          = 0.12 + 0.034
                                                          = 0.154

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.154 or 15.4%.
