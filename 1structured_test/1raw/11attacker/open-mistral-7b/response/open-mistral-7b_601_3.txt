Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the attacker was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly use the witness's reliability to estimate the attacker's race. This is a case of Bayes' theorem, where we need to update our prior probability (in this case, the city's racial distribution) based on the evidence (the witness's statement).

Unfortunately, without more specific information about the witness's error distribution when the race is not visible (or when the person is attacked from behind), we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.
