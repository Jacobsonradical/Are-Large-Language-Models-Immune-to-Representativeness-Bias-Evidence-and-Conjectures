To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(black). The witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually white is then P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The probability that the witness gave an accurate identification is the product of the actual probability of the attacker being black and the reliability of the witness's identification: P(witness is correct) = P(black) * 0.8.

We also know that the probability that the witness gave an incorrect identification (that the attacker is actually white) is P(witness is incorrect) = P(white) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation for the probability of the witness being correct:

P(witness is correct) = P(black) * 0.8 = 0.9 (given by the court assessment)

Now, we can write an equation for the probability of the witness being incorrect:

P(witness is incorrect) = P(white) * 0.2

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we have:

P(black) = 0.15
P(white) = 0.85

We can rewrite the equation for P(witness is incorrect) as:

0.2 = 0.85 * P(white)

Solving for P(white), we get:

P(white) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353

Now we can find P(black) using P(white):

P(black) = 1 - P(white) ≈ 0.7647

Finally, we can find P(witness is correct) using P(black):

P(witness is correct) = P(black) * 0.8 ≈ 0.6118

Since we want the probability that the attacker is black, we can simply use the value of P(black):

{probability: 0.15}

However, since the witness's identification was taken into account, the actual probability of the attacker being black is likely higher than the city's racial demographic. The value of 0.15 is the minimum probability, but the actual probability could be closer to the value of P(witness is correct) = 0.6118.
