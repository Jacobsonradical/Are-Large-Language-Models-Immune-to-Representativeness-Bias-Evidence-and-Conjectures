Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct information about the attacker's race.

We can make an estimate based on the witness's track record and the racial composition of the city. The city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is black. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2. The attacker is white. In this case, the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black (given that the witness's error rate is 20%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the first scenario (the attacker is black) is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

The probability of the second scenario (the attacker is white) is equal to the probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since these scenarios are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8}.
