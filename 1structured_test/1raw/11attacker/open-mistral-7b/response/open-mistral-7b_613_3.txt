Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to identify race, which is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the population demographics and the witness's ability to identify race. The witness's accuracy rate applies to their ability to identify race in their observations, not to the actual demographic distribution in the city.

In this case, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, but we don't know if this was a mistake or if the attacker truly was black. Without more information, we can't definitively say whether the witness's error was due to misidentification or if the attacker actually belongs to the 15% black population of the city.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's not possible to provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. The witness's error could potentially skew our estimate, but without knowing if the error was indeed an error, we can't make a reliable calculation.
