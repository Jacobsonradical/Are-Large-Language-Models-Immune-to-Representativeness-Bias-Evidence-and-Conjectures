Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a rule that allows us to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% white population, so 15% black population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence without considering the hypothesis (this is calculated using the witness's accuracy in identifying people of any race)

The values for the probabilities are given in the problem:

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (witness's overall accuracy in identifying race)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.66667 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%. This is a higher probability than the initial 15% given the city's demographics, but it still leaves some uncertainty due to the witness's error rate.
