To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, P(A|B) is what we want to find (probability of attacker being black given witness's identification), P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification.

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black)
- P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)) (the witness makes a correct identification 80% of the time, and an error 20% of the time. The probability of an error depends on the prior probability of the attacker being black)

We can simplify P(B) as:
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.08 * (1 - 0.15)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.08 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.068
P(B) = 0.188

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.188
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.305

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.305 or 30.5%.
