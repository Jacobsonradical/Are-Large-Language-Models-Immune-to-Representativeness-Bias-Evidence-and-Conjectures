To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the demographics of the city.

The witness has an error rate of 20% when identifying race. This means that they incorrectly identify a person as black 20% of the time when the person is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness correctly identifies a person as black 80% of the time, the probability of encountering a black person and having the witness correctly identify them is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness misidentified a white person as black, and we need to account for this in our estimate. The probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black and being correct in their identification is 0.20 * 0.85 * 0.15 = 0.026 or 2.6%.

Adding the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person and being correct, we get an estimated probability of the attacker being black of 0.12 + 0.026 = 0.146 or 14.6%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 14.6%.
