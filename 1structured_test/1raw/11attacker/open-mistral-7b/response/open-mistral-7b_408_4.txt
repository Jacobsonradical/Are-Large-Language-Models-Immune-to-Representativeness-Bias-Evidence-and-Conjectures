To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the overall racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means that when the witness thinks they are seeing a black person, they are actually seeing a black person 80% of the time.

The witness in this case identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information because we do not know whether the witness was correct or not. To account for this uncertainty, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the attacker's race based on the witness's identification. The theorem states that the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(black|identified as black)) is equal to the probability of the witness identifying someone as black if they are black (the prior probability, P(black)) times the likelihood of the witness being correct given that the attacker is black (P(identified as black|black)), divided by the total probability of the witness's identification (P(identified as black)).

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. P(black) = Proportion of black people in the city, which is 15% (from information b).
2. P(identified as black|black) = Witness's reliability when identifying black people, which is 0.8 (from information a).
3. P(identified as black) = P(black) * P(identified as black|black) + P(not black) * P(identified as black|not black)
   P(not black) = 1 - P(black) = 0.85
   P(identified as black|not black) = 0.2 (from information a)
   P(identified as black) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.27

Now we can calculate the probability P(black|identified as black):

P(black|identified as black) = P(black) * P(identified as black|black) / P(identified as black)
P(black|identified as black) = (0.15) * (0.8) / 0.27 â‰ˆ 0.4815

So our estimate, based on the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.4815 or 48.15%.
