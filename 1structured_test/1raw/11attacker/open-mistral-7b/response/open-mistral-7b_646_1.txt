The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker is actually white) is 20%.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random attack being committed by a white person is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of a white attacker being mistakenly identified as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of a black attacker being mistakenly identified as white is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probability of a black attacker and the probability of a white attacker being mistakenly identified as black:

0.15 (probability of a black attacker) + 0.03 (probability of a white attacker being mistakenly identified as black) = 0.18 (18%)

However, since the witness's error rate is not independent of the actual race of the attacker (as implied by the statement that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time), this calculation may not be accurate. The real probability could be higher or lower.

{probability: 0.18, please note that this is an approximation and the actual probability may be different due to the witness's error rate not being independent of the attacker's race}
