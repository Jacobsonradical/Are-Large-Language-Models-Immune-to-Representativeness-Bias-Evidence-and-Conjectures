To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given that the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person (given that the attacker is not black)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(B) as the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
- P(~A) = 0.85
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time)
- P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Using the given values, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.2925 â‰ˆ 0.269

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.269 or 26.9%.
