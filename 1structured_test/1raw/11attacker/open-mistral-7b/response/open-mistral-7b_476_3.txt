Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define our hypothesis H as "the attacker is black," and R as "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Prior probability of H: p(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
2. Likelihood of R given H: p(R|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
3. Likelihood of R given not-H: p(R|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)
4. Prior probability of not-H: p(~H) = 1 - p(H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

p(H|R) = [p(R|H) * p(H)] / [p(R|H) * p(H) + p(R|~H) * p(~H)]

Substituting the values we have:

p(H|R) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

p(H|R) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. Real-world situations can be more complex and may require additional considerations.
