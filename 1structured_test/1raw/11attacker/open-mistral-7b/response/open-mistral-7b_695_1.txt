To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness identifies races correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial distribution in the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is actually white (Type I error) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is actually black (correct identification).

Type I error probability (P(witness errs | attacker is white)):

P(witness errs | attacker is white) = Probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black * Probability of the attacker being white
P(witness errs | attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Correct identification probability (P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is black)):

P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is black) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person * Probability of the attacker being black
P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is black) / (P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is black) + P(witness errs | attacker is white))
P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
