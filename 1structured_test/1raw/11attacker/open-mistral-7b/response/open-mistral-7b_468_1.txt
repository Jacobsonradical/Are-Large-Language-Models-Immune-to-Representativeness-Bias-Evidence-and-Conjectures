Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The probability of a random person in the city being black is 15% (from point "a").
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is higher than the city's racial distribution. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
3. Point "b" suggests that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the witness is not perfect, there is a chance that the witness could have made an error and identified a white person as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to account for the witness's error rate. Let's assume the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black. In this case, the actual attacker would be white, and the witness's error would increase the perceived racial distribution of black attackers.

Given the witness's 20% error rate, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error and perceiving a white person as black:

Probability of error = Witness's error rate = 20%

Now, let's assume that the witness made this error. The actual attacker is white, but the witness incorrectly perceives the attacker as black, which increases the perceived racial distribution of black attackers. In this scenario, the perceived racial distribution of attackers would shift towards a 50-50 split between whites and blacks.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as black, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black based on the 50-50 split:

Probability of attacker being black given error = 50%

However, we know that the actual racial distribution of people in the city is not 50-50, but 85% white and 15% black. To account for this, we need to adjust the probability of the attacker being black given the error.

Given the witness's error rate, the actual racial distribution of the city, and the witnessed attack being perceived as black, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of error * Probability of attacker being black given error + Probability of no error * Probability of attacker being black in the city

Probability of error = 0.2
Probability of attacker being black given error = 0.5
Probability of no error = 1 - Probability of error = 0.8
Probability of attacker being black in the city = 0.15

Probability of attacker being black = 0.2 * 0.5 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.18

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18%.
