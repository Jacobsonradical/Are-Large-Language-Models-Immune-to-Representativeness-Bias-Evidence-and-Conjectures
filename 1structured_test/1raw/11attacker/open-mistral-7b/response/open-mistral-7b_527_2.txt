Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black in this case, we can consider this as an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's error, is 20%.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. Since the witness made an error, it's more likely that the witness erroneously identified a white person as black rather than mistakenly identifying a black person as white. This is because the probability of a white person being in the city is higher than that of a black person.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, can be estimated as the ratio of the probability of a black person being in the city to the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B err) be the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black. We know P(B) = 0.15, and P(W|B err) = 0.20. We also know that P(W) = 0.85, the probability of a white person being in the city.

Since the witness made an error, we can assume that the attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. So, the probability of this happening is P(W|B err) = P(B) * P(W|B) + P(W^2) * P(W|W), where P(W|B) is the probability of a white person being correctly identified as white if the attacker is black, and P(W^2) is the probability of two white people being present.

Since the witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time, P(W|B) = 0.8. Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, P(W^2) = 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595.

Therefore, we can write the equation: P(B) = P(W|B err) / (P(W|B err) + P(W^2) * P(W|B)) = 0.20 / (0.20 + 0.595 * 0.8) ≈ 0.15

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both races. Since we don't have enough information to support this assumption, a more conservative estimate would be to use the overall error rate of 20%. In this case, P(B) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176, which is slightly higher than the estimated error rate but still below 50%.

In summary, based on the information provided, the most conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.6%, while a less conservative estimate that assumes the witness's error rate is the same for both races is approximately 15%.
