To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80%, meaning they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. However, we only have information about their performance in controlled conditions. In real-life situations, such as a dark night, their accuracy might be lower.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can't make a definitive estimate of the attacker's race based solely on the witness's description. However, if we assume that the witness's accuracy in real-life situations is similar to their controlled conditions accuracy of 80%, we can make a rough estimate.

To do this, we can imagine the witness encountering a black person and a white person in the dark and guessing their races. Since there are more white people in the city, the witness is more likely to encounter a white person. Therefore, their 80% accuracy would lead them to incorrectly identify a black person as white more often than they would incorrectly identify a white person as black.

To account for this, we can adjust the witness's accuracy in real-life situations. A common method to do this is to use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the event (in this case, the attacker being black or white). However, without more specific information about the witness's accuracy in real-life situations, we can't provide a precise number.

Therefore, our answer in the dictionary format would look like this:
{probability: a rough estimate, depending on the witness's real-life accuracy, which we cannot determine with the given information}
