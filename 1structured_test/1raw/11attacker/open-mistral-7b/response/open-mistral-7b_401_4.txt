To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black, it's important to consider these proportions as well.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is actually white. In this scenario, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 20%. The probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, is then 1 - 20% = 80%.

However, we know that only 15% of the city's population is black. This means that if the attacker is actually white, the probability that we would observe a witness who incorrectly identifies the attacker as black (given that the attacker is white) is 20% times the probability that the attacker is white.

So, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is:

80% * (1 - 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.656 or 65.6%

Since we are trying to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can find this by subtracting the probability that the attacker is white from 1:

1 - 0.656 = 0.344 or 34.4%

However, the witness actually identified the attacker as black. Given this identification, the probability that the attacker is black is 100% since we are assuming that the witness's identification is correct in this case.

There seems to be a discrepancy between the probability estimate based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics (34.4%) and the probability estimate based on the witness's identification being correct (100%). This discrepancy arises because the witness's identification is not perfectly reliable, and the city's demographics do not fully capture the uncertainty in the witness's identification.

Given the information provided, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 100%, but this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's identification is perfectly reliable, which we know is not the case. A more nuanced estimate would take into account the uncertainty in the witness's identification and the city's demographics.
