To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time.
2. Given the racial distribution of the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black is P(black) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is P(not black) * 0.2, where P(not black) = 1 - P(black).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation:
P(black) * 0.8 = 0.2 * P(not black)

Now we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.2 / 0.8 * P(not black)
P(black) = 0.25 * P(not black)

Since P(black) + P(not black) = 1, we can write another equation:
P(black) + P(not black) = 1
P(black) = 1 - P(not black)

Substitute the expression for P(black) from the first equation:
P(black) = 1 - (0.25 * P(not black))

Now we have a single equation with one unknown:

0.25 * P(not black) = 0.75
P(not black) = 3

Since P(not black) should be a probability between 0 and 1, there is an error in the original information or the witness's ability to judge race under these conditions is not accurate enough to make a reliable estimate. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate for the attacker's race.
