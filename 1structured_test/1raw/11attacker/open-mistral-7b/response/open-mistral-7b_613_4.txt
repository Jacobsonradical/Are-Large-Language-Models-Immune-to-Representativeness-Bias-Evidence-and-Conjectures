Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

The witness's identifying the attacker as black might be due to two reasons:

- The attacker is indeed black.
- The witness made an error and mistakenly identified the attacker as black (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both scenarios and their probabilities.

The probability that the attacker is black in the general population is 15%, as stated in the first piece of information.

The probability that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified the attacker as black is 20%, as stated in the second piece of information.

Since we cannot distinguish between the two scenarios based on the given information, we must consider them equally likely and add their probabilities:

Probability of attacker being black in the witness's report = Probability of attacker being black in the population + Probability of witness error
                                                                         = 0.15 + 0.20
                                                                         = 0.35

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification might not be accurate due to the poor lighting and other conditions at night. The actual probability might be lower than 0.35.
