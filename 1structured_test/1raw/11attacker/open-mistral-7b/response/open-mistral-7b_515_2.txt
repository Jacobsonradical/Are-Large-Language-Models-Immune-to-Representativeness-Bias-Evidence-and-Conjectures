Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correcting the race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the city (which is not necessarily the case, but we don't have enough information to adjust for this), then we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black by multiplying the probability of the attacker being white (85%) by the error rate (20%):

Probability of misidentifying a white person as black = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a black person as black is also 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.8}
