Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:
1. We know that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
3. If the witness sees a white person, the probability of incorrectly identifying them as black is 0.2 (20%).
4. If the witness sees a black person, the probability of incorrectly identifying them as white is also 0.2 (20%).
5. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a white person is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person is also 0.8 (80%).
6. The witness has identified the attacker as black, so we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually black given this witness's identification.
7. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).
8. The total probability of the witness identifying a person as black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person) + 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black) = 0.8 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97
9. However, since the witness has already identified the attacker as black, we only need to consider the probability of a black person being misidentified as white by the witness. This probability is 0.2 (20%).
10. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the inverse of the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white: 1 / 0.2 = 5

Based on the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 5 times higher than the probability of the attacker being white. Since the probability of a white person is 0.85 and the probability of a black person is 0.15, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 5 * 0.15 = 0.75}
