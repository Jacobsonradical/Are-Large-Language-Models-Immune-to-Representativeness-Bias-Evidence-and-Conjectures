To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness made a mistake and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black in the general population is 0.15.

The witness's incorrect identification increases the probability that the attacker is white. So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is the probability of the attacker being black in the general population (0.15) minus the probability that the witness made a mistake (0.20).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is 0.15 - 0.20 = -0.05.

However, it's important to note that probabilities cannot be negative. This might indicate that there's an inconsistency in the information provided or that the reasoning used to estimate the probability is not correct. It would be ideal to have more information or to reconsider the assumptions made in the calculation.
