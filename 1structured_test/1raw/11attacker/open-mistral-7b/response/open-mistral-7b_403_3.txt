Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Event B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the prior probability of event A (P(A)) and the conditional probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)). We also have the prior probability of event B (P(B)) and the conditional probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)).

From the information provided, we can calculate P(A) as 15% (since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black), P(B|A) as 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black), P(B) as the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|A^c), where A^c is the complementary event of A (the attacker is not black), and P(A|B) is the probability we are trying to estimate.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B|A^c) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.833.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 83.3%. This means that, based on the information provided, there is an 83.3% chance that the attacker is black.
