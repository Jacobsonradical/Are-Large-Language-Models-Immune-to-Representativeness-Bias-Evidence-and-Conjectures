Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% of the time, and an error rate of 20%.

However, the second piece of information is not directly applicable to the attacker's race because the attacker was not seen by the witness. The witness's statement only introduces some level of potential bias or uncertainty into the racial profile of the attacker.

Since the victim did not see the attacker's race, the most accurate estimate of the attacker's race would be based on the city's racial demographics. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%. This is based on the fact that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
