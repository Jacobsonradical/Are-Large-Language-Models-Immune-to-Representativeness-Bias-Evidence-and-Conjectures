To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can estimate based on the demographics of the city. From the information given, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. From the information given, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

4. P(A) + P(not A) is the total probability of the attacker being either black or not black, which is 1.

5. Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

   P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

   P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 25%. This is significantly lower than the 80% accuracy the witness has in identifying race under ideal conditions, indicating that the witness's identification may not be reliable in this situation. However, it is still higher than the 15% proportion of black people in the city's population.
