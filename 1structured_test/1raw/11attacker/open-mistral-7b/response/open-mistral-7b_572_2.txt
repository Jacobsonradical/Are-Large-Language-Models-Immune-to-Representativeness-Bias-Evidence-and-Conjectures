To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. Reliability of the witness: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. Racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person as Q = 0.2 (20% error rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually black.
B) The witness mistakenly identified a white person as black.

The probability of scenario A is P(black), and the probability of scenario B is Q * P(white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation to represent the total probability:

P(black) + P(white) * Q = 1

Substitute the values for Q and P(white):

P(black) + 0.85 * 0.2 = 1

P(black) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83 (83%).
