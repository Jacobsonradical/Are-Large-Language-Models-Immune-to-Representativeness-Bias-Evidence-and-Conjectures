To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in statistics and probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given two pieces of information:
1) P(A) = probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (from information b)
2) P(B|A) = probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 (from information a)
3) P(B|~A) = probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (from information a)

We do not have enough information to calculate P(~A) directly, but we can use the fact that P(A) + P(~A) = 1, so P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where P(B) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black, which is the sum of the probabilities of her being correct (when the attacker is black) and being incorrect (when the attacker is not black):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Plugging the values in, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
