Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in determining race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct evidence that the witness's identification is correct in this specific case.

We do know the racial composition of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black. Without knowing whether the witness's mistake in this case was incorrectly identifying a black person as white or vice versa, we can't make a definitive probability estimate.

But if we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two races (which might not be the case), then the probability of the witness being incorrect given that they identified the attacker as black would be 20%.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of the witness being correct times the probability of the attacker being black in the population, plus the probability of the witness being incorrect times the probability of the attacker being white in the population.

This can be written as:

P(Attacker is black) = P(Witness is correct and Attacker is black) + P(Witness is incorrect and Attacker is white)

P(Witness is correct and Attacker is black) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness is correct given Attacker is black)
P(Witness is incorrect and Attacker is white) = P(Witness is incorrect) * P(Attacker is white)

Substituting the values given:

P(Attacker is black) = (P(Witness is correct and Attacker is black)) / (P(Witness is correct and Attacker is black) + P(Witness is incorrect and Attacker is white))

= (P(Attacker is black) * 0.8) / ((P(Attacker is black) * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Solving this equation for P(Attacker is black) is a complex task that requires knowledge of the exact values of P(Attacker is black) and P(Witness is correct given Attacker is black). Without this information, it's not possible to provide a numerical estimate.

Therefore, the strict answer to your question would be: {probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1}
