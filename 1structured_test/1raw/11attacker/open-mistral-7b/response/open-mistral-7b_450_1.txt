To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness's testimony

We are given the following information:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify race 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = unknown, but we can estimate it based on the city's population
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We are also given that P(E|not H) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to incorrectly identify race 20% of the time), and P(not H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Now we can compute P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now estimate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
