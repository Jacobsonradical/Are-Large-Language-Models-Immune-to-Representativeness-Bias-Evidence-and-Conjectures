Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(~B) as the probability that the attacker is not black

We are given P(B) = 0.15 (15%), P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.2. We are also given that the total probability of the witness making a correct identification is P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B).

We can rearrange this equation to find P(B) given P(W):

P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

Plugging in the known values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B) â‰ˆ 0.252

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 25.2%.
