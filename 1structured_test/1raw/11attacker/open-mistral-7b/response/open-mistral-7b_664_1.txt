Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is either black or white. If the witness identifies the attacker correctly, it means the attacker is indeed black. If the witness makes an error, it means the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (the attacker is black) is 0.8 (from the witness's ability). The probability of the witness making an error (the attacker is white) is 0.2.

However, we also know that the attacker is more likely to be white, given that 85% of the population is white. We can calculate the probability of the attacker being white given a correct identification by the witness as follows:

P(Attacker is white | Witness's correct identification) = P(Witness's correct identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white) / (P(Witness's correct identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness's correct identification | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white))

We can calculate this probability using the given numbers:

P(Attacker is white | Witness's correct identification) = 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.25 = 0.62

This means that, given a correct identification by the witness, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.62.

However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, not the probability that the attacker is white given a correct identification. We can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Attacker is black) = P(Attacker is black and Witness's correct identification) / P(Witness's correct identification) + P(Attacker is black and Witness's error) / P(Witness's error)

P(Attacker is black and Witness's correct identification) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness's correct identification | Attacker is black) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

P(Attacker is black and Witness's error) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness's error | Attacker is black) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

P(Witness's correct identification) = P(Attacker is black and Witness's correct identification) + P(Attacker is black and Witness's error) + P(Attacker is white and Witness's correct identification) + P(Attacker is white and Witness's error) = 0.12 + 0.03 + 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.34

P(Witness's error) = 1 - P(Witness's correct identification) = 1 - 0.34 = 0.66

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.12 / 0.34 + 0.03 / 0.66 = 0.35 / 1.00 = 0.35

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.35.
