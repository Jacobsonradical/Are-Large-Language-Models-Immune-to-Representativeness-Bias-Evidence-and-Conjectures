Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we are interested in is that the attacker is black. The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (85% or 0.85 in this case)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (given in the problem as 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (given in the problem as 0.2)
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (100% - 85% or 0.15 in this case)

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.85 / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15] = 0.682 / 0.682 + 0.03 = 0.682 / 0.71 = 0.968

However, it seems there is a mistake in the given information, as the sum of the probabilities for P(B|A) and P(B|~A) is lower than 1, which is not possible in this context. The given probabilities should add up to 1.

Assuming that the given probabilities are correct and they add up to 1, the estimated probability that the attacker is black would be 0.682, not 0.968.
