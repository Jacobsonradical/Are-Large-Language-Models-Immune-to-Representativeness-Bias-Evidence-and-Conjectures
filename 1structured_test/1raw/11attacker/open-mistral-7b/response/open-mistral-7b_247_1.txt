Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't have exact data for, but we can estimate using the city's population statistics)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the witness's statement (that the attacker is black)
- P(A|B) is the probability we're trying to find, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black

The witness's statement has a 20% error rate, so P(B|not A) is also 20%. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, given the city's population statistics, can be estimated as:
P(A) = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
          = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12, or 12%. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes several simplifications, such as that the witness's ability to identify race is perfectly accurate in the absence of error, and that the attacker's race is a completely random event. In reality, these assumptions may not hold, and the actual probability could be different.
