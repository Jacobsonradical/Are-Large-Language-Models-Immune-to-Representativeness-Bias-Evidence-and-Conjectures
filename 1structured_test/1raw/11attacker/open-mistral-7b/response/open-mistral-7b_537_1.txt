To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating probabilities in light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black if they are actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is black)

Given the information, we can calculate the following:

1. P(B|A) is the witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 0.8 (80%)
2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker's race. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume it to be 0.5 (50%) as there's no reason to believe one race is more likely than the other.
3. P(B) can be calculated using the city's population distribution: 0.15 (15%) is the probability of the attacker being black, and 0.85 (85%) is the probability of the attacker being white.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.5 / (0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.5)
â‰ˆ 0.526

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 52.6%.
