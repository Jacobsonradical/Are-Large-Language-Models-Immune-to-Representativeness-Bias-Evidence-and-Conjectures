To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's statement).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the evidence (the probability of the witness making the statement)

We are given the following information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = Unknown (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(B) = P(the witness identifies the attacker as black)

To find P(B), we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so:

P(B) = 1 - P(not-B) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.8 = P(A)

Since P(A|B) = P(A), we can say that the witness's statement does not change our belief about the probability of the attacker being black. However, we are given additional information about the racial composition of the city, which can be used to update our prior probability P(A).

Given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, we can update our prior probability P(A) to reflect this. This means that before the witness's statement, we would have believed that the attacker was white with a probability of 0.85, and black with a probability of 0.15.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial composition of the city, is 0.15. This means that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black, and an 85% chance that the attacker is white.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.15}
