Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who is not necessarily an expert or unbiased, correctly identified a person's race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
2. The racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's observation of the attacker was made in poor lighting conditions, which might affect their ability to accurately judge a person's race. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate could be higher in this specific case.

Without further information about the witness's performance in similar low-visibility conditions, it's difficult to provide a precise probability. However, we can make an educated guess based on the general error rate and the racial distribution of the city.

Since the witness's error rate is 20% in good lighting conditions, it's plausible that the error rate could be higher in poor lighting conditions. Let's assume that the error rate in this specific case is 30%. This means that the witness might have mistakenly identified a white person as black 30% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white, a 30% error rate would mean that 25.5% of the identified black population would actually be white people mistakenly identified as black. This leaves us with a true black population of 14.5%.

Therefore, based on this assumption, I would estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is around 14.5% (or 0.145). This is a rough estimate and should be interpreted with caution, as it relies on several assumptions about the witness's performance in poor lighting conditions.
