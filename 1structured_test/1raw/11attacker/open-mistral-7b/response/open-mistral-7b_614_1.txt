Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means in this specific case, the witness erred. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's error, is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 20%.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. The probability of the attacker being black is therefore 1 minus the probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, we should consider the witness's error in this case. Since the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black, it is more likely that the actual attacker is white, given the witness's error, and less likely that the attacker is black. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's error, is the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.8, multiplied by the population probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, which is less than the population probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, taking into account the witness's error, is 0.12.
