Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
B) The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identification.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

A) Probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race = 15% (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's success rate) = 0.12 or 12%

B) Probability of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race = 85% (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17 or 17%

Since the witness has identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the sum of the probabilities of scenario A and its complement (scenario B).

The complementary probability of scenario A is the probability of scenario B, so the final calculation would be:

0.12 (probability of attacker being black and correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of attacker being white and incorrect identification) = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 29%.
