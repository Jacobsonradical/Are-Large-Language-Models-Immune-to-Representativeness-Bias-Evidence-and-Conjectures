To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% (correct identifications) and the error rate is 20% (incorrect identifications). Since the racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the majority of people the witness encounters are white.

Given this, it's plausible that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black due to the higher frequency of white people in the city. However, we also know that 85% of the population is white, so it's less likely that the attacker is white than one might initially think based on the witness's description.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is P(white) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is P(black) * 0.8 = x.

Given the witness's description, the likelihood of the attacker being black is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, divided by the total probability:

P(attacker is black) = (x + 0.03) / (x + 0.03 + 0.15 * 0.2)

We cannot solve for x directly, but we can make an educated guess based on the information provided. Since the witness is more likely to err when identifying a black person as white, it's reasonable to assume that x > 0.03.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black lies between 0.06 and 1, with a best estimate of around 0.5 (50%) if we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying black and white people.
