To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that there is a higher probability that the attacker is white. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time even when the person was actually white.

Given that the witness couldn't see the attacker's race, we can treat the witness's identification as a false positive occurrence. The probability of a false positive is 20%.

On the other hand, the probability of a true positive (correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the product of the actual probability of the attacker being black and the witness's accuracy in identifying black people. This can be calculated as follows:

Probability of true positive = Probability of attacker being black * Witness's accuracy

Since we don't have the exact probability of the attacker being black, we can't calculate the true positive directly. However, we can set up an equation using the probabilities of false positives and true positives, assuming that the sum of both probabilities equals 1:

False positive + True positive = 1

To solve for the probability of true positive, we can substitute the false positive value (0.2) in the equation:

0.2 + True positive = 1

0.2 = 1 - True positive

True positive = 1 - 0.2

True positive = 0.8

The witness's accuracy in identifying black people (0.8) can be considered as the probability of a true positive given that the attacker is actually black. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black can be found by dividing the probability of a true positive by the witness's accuracy:

Probability of attacker being black = True positive / Witness's accuracy

Probability of attacker being black = 0.8 / 0.8

Probability of attacker being black = 1

However, this result is not reasonable, as it assumes that the witness is 100% accurate in identifying races, which contradicts the given information. It's more likely that the probability of the attacker being black is less than 1, even though the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's difficult to give an exact probability of the attacker being black. However, we can infer that the probability is likely to be less than 1, taking into account the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.
