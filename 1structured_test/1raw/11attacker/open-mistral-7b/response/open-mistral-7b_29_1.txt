Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be:

{probability: 0.84}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a correct identification (attacker is actually black) is 0.80.
4. However, since the attacker's race was not definitively determined from the victim's account, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification.
5. The probability of the witness making an error (attacker is actually white) is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.
6. Since there is no additional information about the likelihood of a white attacker or the reliability of the witness's identification under these specific circumstances, we cannot assign a higher probability to one race over the other.
7. Therefore, the overall probability estimate for the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of the correct identification and the error, weighted by their likelihoods: 0.80 * (probability of attacker being black given correct identification) + 0.20 * (probability of attacker being white given error)
8. The probability of attacker being black given correct identification is 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black), and the probability of attacker being white given error is 0 (since we have no information about the probability of a white attacker in this specific scenario).
9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: 0.80 * 1 + 0.20 * 0 = 0.80
10. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 80%.
