To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means that when the actual race is different from what the witness perceives, the witness is more likely to mistake a white person for a black person than the other way around, given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is P(white) * 0.2, where P(white) is the probability of the attacker being white.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we can set up the following conditional probability equation:

P(black | identified as black) = P(black) / (P(black) + P(white) * 0.2)

The witness's statement that they correctly identified the race 80% of the time can be interpreted as their judgment being unbiased in this respect, i.e., P(correct) = 0.8. The probability of making an error, P(error), is then 0.2.

We can set up another conditional probability equation:

P(correct) = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 * 0.8

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) P(black | identified as black) = P(black) / (P(black) + P(white) * 0.2)
2) 0.8 = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 * 0.8

Unfortunately, we cannot solve this system of equations analytically due to the nonlinear form of the first equation. However, we can make an approximation by linearizing the first equation around the point where P(black) = P(white) = 0.5. This gives us:

P(black | identified as black) ≈ 0.5 + 0.1 * (P(black) - 0.5)

Now we can solve the linearized equation:

0.8 ≈ 0.5 + 0.1 * P(black)

P(black) ≈ 0.8

However, this approximation is not fully accurate due to the nonlinearity of the original equation. A more precise estimate would require numerical methods or simulation-based modeling.

In conclusion, based on the given information and the linear approximation, we estimate the probability of the attacker being black to be 0.8, or 80%. However, this estimate should be considered an approximation and may not be fully accurate due to the nonlinearity of the original equation.
