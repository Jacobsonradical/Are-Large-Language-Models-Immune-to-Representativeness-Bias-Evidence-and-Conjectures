To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (making an error). Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness made an error in this specific case, we'll assume an equal distribution of errors between identifying whites and blacks. This means that the witness errs in identifying blacks as whites 10% of the time and errs in identifying whites as blacks 10% of the time.

Given the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black), the probability of a random attack being committed by a white person is 0.85, and the probability of a random attack being committed by a black person is 0.15.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. If we assume that the witness's error in this case was an error in identifying a white person as black, then the probability that the actual attacker is white is the probability of the witness making that specific error, which is 10%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.1, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different if more information about the case and the witness's error distribution is available.
