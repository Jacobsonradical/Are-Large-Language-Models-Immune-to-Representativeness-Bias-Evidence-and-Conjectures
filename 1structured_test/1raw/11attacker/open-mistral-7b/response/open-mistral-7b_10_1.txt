Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to calculate conditional probability in probability theory. In our case, we want to find P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Report), so we can use the following formula:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Report) = (P(Witness's Report | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)) / P(Witness's Report)

Where:
- P(Attacker is Black) is the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's report. This is given by the population distribution: P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15
- P(Witness's Report | Attacker is Black) is the likelihood, which is the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given by the witness's accuracy rate: P(Witness's Report | Attacker is Black) = 0.8
- P(Attacker is White | Witness's Report) is the alternative likelihood, which is the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This can be calculated as P(Attacker is White) * P(Witness's Report | Attacker is White) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
- P(Witness's Report) is the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as black, which is the sum of the likelihood and the alternative likelihood: P(Witness's Report) = P(Witness's Report | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's Report | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Report) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66.7%.
