Given the information provided, we have a witness who is somewhat reliable at identifying race, with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%. However, we do not have information about how accurate the witness was in this specific case.

The second piece of information is the racial composition of the city, with 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the racial composition of the city, which would make the attacker more likely to be white based on demographic data.

Since we do not have specific information about the witness's accuracy in this case, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate. A conservative approach would be to use the demographic data, but this would not take into account the witness's unreliability in this specific situation. Therefore, I would suggest further investigation or additional information to make a more accurate estimate.
