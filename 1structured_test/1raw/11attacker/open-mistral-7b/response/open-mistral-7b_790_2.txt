Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the population demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is stated as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that when the witness was wrong, they were more likely to identify someone as black rather than white, given the city's demographics (85% white and 15% black).

So, the probability that the witness was wrong and the attacker is black is actually higher than the 20% error rate. We can calculate this probability as follows:

1. The probability of the witness being wrong and identifying a white person as black is 20%.
2. However, since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness being wrong and identifying an attacker who is actually white as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being white is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).
4. Since the attacker is not white, the probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness being wrong and identifying an attacker as black, which is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%).

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the race of the person they are trying to identify. Given the racial bias in society, it's likely that the witness's error rate is higher when they are trying to identify a black person as white, rather than the other way around. This would make the probability of the attacker being black even lower.

Therefore, while it's impossible to give a definitive probability without more information, based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics, it's unlikely that the attacker is black.

{probability: 0.03, please note that this is an estimate based on the provided information and assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the race of the person they are trying to identify, which may not be the case.}
