Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's observations are independent events, the probability of them correctly identifying the attacker as black is the same as their success rate.

However, the witness stated that they saw the attacker from behind, which might affect their ability to accurately identify the race. Without more information about how the witness's ability to identify race is affected by viewing someone from behind, it's difficult to make a precise estimate.

Given that we do not have enough information to adjust the witness's success rate, we can only use the 80% probability provided by the witness. So, based on the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker is black is roughly 0.8 (or 80%).
