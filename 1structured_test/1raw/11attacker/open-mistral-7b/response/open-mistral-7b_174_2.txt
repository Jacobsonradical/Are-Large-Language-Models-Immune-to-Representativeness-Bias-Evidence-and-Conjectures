To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

Let's calculate the probabilities for these two scenarios:

1. Probability of being correct when the attacker is black: 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate)
2. Probability of being incorrect when the attacker is black: 0.2 (witness's error rate)

Since the attacker's race is either black or white, and the witness's identification can be either correct or incorrect, we can write the probability of the witness's identification given the attacker's race as follows:

P(witness's identification | attacker's race) = P(correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(incorrect identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is white)

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)
P(attacker is white) = 0.85

P(correct identification | attacker is black) = 0.8
P(incorrect identification | attacker is black) = 0.2
P(attacker is white) = 0.85
P(incorrect identification | attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can plug these probabilities into the equation:

P(witness's identification | attacker's race) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.13 + 0.15 ≈ 0.28

The witness's identification suggests that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.28. However, we should consider that the witness's identification might not always be accurate, and the actual probability of the attacker being black could be different from this estimate. It would be important to gather more information and evidence to arrive at a more accurate probability.
