Given the two pieces of information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographic distribution.

First, let's note that the witness incorrectly identified a race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identified the race 80% of the time.

Second, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Given this, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as follows:

1. The probability of randomly picking a black person from the population is 0.15 (15%).
2. Given that the witness is 80% reliable, the probability that they correctly identify a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (85%) * 0.2 (20% error rate) = 0.17 (17%).

Given these two probabilities, the witness's testimony increases the overall probability that the attacker is black by 0.12 - 0.17 = -0.05, which is not a valid probability. This means that the witness's testimony actually decreases the probability that the attacker is black, given their reliability and the city's demographics.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black. However, this conclusion is not based on solid statistical evidence and should be treated with caution. It would be important to consider other evidence or factors to make a more informed decision.

{probability: -0.05, please note that this value is not a valid probability and the estimate is inconclusive based on the provided information.}
