To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (probability that the witness would describe the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (probability that the witness described the attacker as black)

Let's break it down:

1. P(B|A) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black).
2. P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is what we're trying to find.
3. P(B) can be calculated using the information about the city's population: 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * P(A) / 0.15

Solving for P(A):

P(A) = (0.15 * P(A|B)) / 0.8

P(A) = 0.1875 * 0.8 / 1

P(A) = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.15 or 15%.
