The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as the product of the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) and the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given as 15% in the first piece of information. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%.

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(B|not A)) is the witness's error rate, which is 20%. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is:

P(B|not A) = (0.85 * 0.2) / (0.85 + 0.15) = 0.17

The probability of the witness identifying a random person as black is then the sum of these two probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.25

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25 = 0.6

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.6 or 60%.
