Given the information provided, we can't make a definitive estimate based solely on the attack description and the witness's racial identification accuracy. However, we can use the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city to make an approximate estimation.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is random (which might not be the case, but we don't have enough information to make a different assumption), then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is the same as the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of selecting a white person at random is 0.85, and the probability of selecting a black person is 0.15. The probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (the witness's error rate), and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white is also 0.2.

Since the probabilities of incorrect identification are equal, we can assume that the witness made an error in 20% of their identifications of either race. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the same as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, which is 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12 (12%).

However, it's important to note that this is a simplified interpretation based on several assumptions (equal error rates, randomness of attacker's race, etc.). The actual probability could be different, and more information would be needed to make a more accurate estimate.
