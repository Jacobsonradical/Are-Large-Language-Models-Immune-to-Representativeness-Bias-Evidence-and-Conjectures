To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's error rate.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white given that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the population is 85% white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the complement of the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness's testimony suggests that the attacker is black. Therefore, we should adjust our estimate to account for the witness's accuracy. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black is 0.80.

Therefore, our final estimate is the probability that the witness is correct times the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness is correct, which is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
