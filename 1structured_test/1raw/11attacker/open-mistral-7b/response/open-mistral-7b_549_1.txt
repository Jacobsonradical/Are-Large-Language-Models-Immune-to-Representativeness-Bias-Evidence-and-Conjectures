To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
- A as the event that the attacker is black.
- ⌐A as the event that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white).

From the information given, we know three probabilities:

1. P(E|A) = 0.8: The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black.
2. P(E|⌐A) = 0.2: The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white).
3. P(A) = 0.15: The prior probability that the attacker is black, given the city's demographics.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|⌐A) * P(⌐A)]

Substituting our known values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probabilities, we find:

P(A|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|E) ≈ 0.41 (41%)

So, based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41%.
