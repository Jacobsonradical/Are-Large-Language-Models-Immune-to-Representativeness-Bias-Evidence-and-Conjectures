To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information about how often the witness was presented with a black person versus a white person to accurately account for this in our calculation.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black without considering the witness's reliability:

{probability: 0.15}

However, since we know the witness's identification is not always reliable, we should adjust our calculation to account for this. Without more specific information about the witness's performance with black and white individuals, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate.

Therefore, I cannot strictly provide a number between 0 and 1 as the probability that the attacker is black. But given the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city, we can say that the probability is likely to be higher than 0.15 but lower than 0.85.
