Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

The hypothesis here is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) * P(~H) = 1 - (0.8) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.12) * (0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.144

Therefore, based on the provided information and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14.4%.
