Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's identification of the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black, given in the first piece of information (85%)
- P(E|H): probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given in the second piece of information (80%)
- P(E|~H): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white, given in the second piece of information (1 - 0.80 = 0.20)
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker being white, given in the first piece of information (1 - P(H) = 15%)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of H given E is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.80 * 0.85] / [0.80 * 0.85 + 0.20 * 0.15]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.707

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 70.7%. This means that given the witness's identification, we believe that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, but there is still some uncertainty.
