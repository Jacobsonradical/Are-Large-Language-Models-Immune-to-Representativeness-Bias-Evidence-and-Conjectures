To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis).

We are given the following:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  Where:
  - P(E|~H) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
  - P(~H) is the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)

Since we are not given the value of P(E|~H) or P(~H), we cannot directly calculate P(E). However, we can use the given values to calculate P(H|E) as an approximation.

P(H|E) ≈ P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Since we do not have P(E|~H) and P(~H), we cannot calculate an exact probability. However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race (ignoring potential racial bias in the witness). In this case, the probability of the witness making a mistake (identifying a white person as black or a black person as white) would be equal to the probability of making a correct identification. This assumption simplifies the equation to:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(H|E) ≈ 0.12

So, based on the given information and the assumption of independent race identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%. This estimate is sensitive to the assumption, and the actual probability could be different.
