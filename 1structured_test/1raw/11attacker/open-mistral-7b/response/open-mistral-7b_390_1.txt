Given the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider: the demographic distribution of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. Demographic distribution: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. Witness's ability to identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate is not specified for identifying black individuals specifically. We only know the overall error rate. Without this information, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to the demographic distribution to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

So, based on the information provided, it is not possible to provide a numeric estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. It would require additional information about the witness's error rate for identifying black individuals to make a more accurate estimation.
