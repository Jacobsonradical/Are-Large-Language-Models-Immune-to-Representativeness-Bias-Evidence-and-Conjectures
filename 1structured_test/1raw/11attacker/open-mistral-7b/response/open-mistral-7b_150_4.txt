Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

We cannot directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as the witness's observation was biased and not based on objective facts. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's observation and the city's demographics.

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, stating that the probability of an event A given evidence B is proportional to the probability of B given A, multiplied by the prior probability of A.

In this case, let:
- A = Attacker is black
- B = Witness identifies attacker as black

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black and P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

P(B|A) is equal to 1, as the witness always identifies a black attacker as black.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This is the sum of the probabilities of the attacker being black and the attacker being white, each multiplied by the corresponding probability of the witness correctly identifying the race.

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
          = P(A) * 1 + P(not A) * (1 - 0.8)
          = P(A) + P(not A) * 0.2

P(B) can be calculated using the city's demographics:
P(B) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 1 * P(A) / 0.17

Since we don't have the prior probability P(A), we cannot provide a specific number for P(A|B). However, we can express the result in terms of P(A):

P(A|B) = 1 / 0.17 * P(A)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation and the city's demographics, is proportional to the prior probability of the attacker being black, and the constant of proportionality is 1 / 0.17. Without knowing the prior probability P(A), we cannot provide a specific number for P(A|B).
