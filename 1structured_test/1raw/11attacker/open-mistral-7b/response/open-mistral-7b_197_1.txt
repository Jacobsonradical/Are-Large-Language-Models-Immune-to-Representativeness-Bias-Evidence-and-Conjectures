To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

1. P(E|H): The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is 0.8.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the hypothesis that the attacker is black is the proportion of black people in the city. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): The probability of the evidence is the probability of a random person being identified as black by the witness. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
          = 0.66667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.67, or 67%.
