Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

1. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person, then the probability that they incorrectly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker is actually white) is the same as the error rate of 20%.
2. On the other hand, the probability that they correctly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker is actually black) is their success rate of 80%.
3. Given the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black is 15%.
4. However, we must consider the possibility that the witness might have erred in their identification. The probability that they err in identifying the attacker as black is 20%.
5. Since they have erroneously identified a black person as an attacker, we must subtract this probability from the actual probability of a black attacker: 15% - 20% * (probability of the attacker being white).

Let x be the probability of the attacker being white. Then, the equation becomes:

15% - 20% * x = probability of attacker being black

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 15% / (1 - 0.2 * 0.85)

x â‰ˆ 0.23

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.23, or 23%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and might not necessarily reflect the true situation due to factors such as lighting conditions, witness's perception, etc.
