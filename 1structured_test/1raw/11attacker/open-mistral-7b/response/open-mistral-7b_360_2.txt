Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error.

The probability of the first scenario (the attacker is black) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the proportion of black people in the city.

The probability of the second scenario (the attacker is white) is the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person times the proportion of white people in the city.

So, we have:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black) * P(attacker is black | witness correctly identifies black)
                               = 0.8 * P(attacker is black | witness correctly identifies black)

And:

P(attacker is white) = P(witness erroneously identifies white) * P(attacker is white | witness erroneously identifies white)
                                 = 0.2 * P(attacker is white | witness erroneously identifies white)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can assume that when the witness errs, they are more likely to mistake a black person for white than the other way around, given the racial composition of the city. Let's assume that the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a black person as white is 0.9 (90% chance, as they are more likely to misjudge a rare minority).

Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person when they err is 0.1 (10% chance).

So, we have:

P(attacker is black | witness incorrectly identifies black) = 1 / 0.9 ≈ 0.11 (11% chance)
P(attacker is white | witness incorrectly identifies white) = 1 / 0.1 ≈ 10 (100% chance)

Now, we can calculate the probabilities:

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.11 ≈ 0.088 (8.8%)
P(attacker is white) = 0.2 * 10 = 2 (20%)

However, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we should not consider the second scenario (attacker is white) in this calculation. So, the final estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city, is:

{probability: 0.088, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

In this case, the probability estimate is approximately 0.088 or 8.8%. This means that, given the information provided, the attacker has an estimated 8.8% chance of being black.
