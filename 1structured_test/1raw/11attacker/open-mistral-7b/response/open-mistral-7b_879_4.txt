Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's demographics and the witness's reliability.

1. City demographics: The city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. Witness reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate applies to a balanced population (half white and half black). In the actual city's demographics, the witness might have more opportunities to see and correctly identify whites due to their numerical superiority.

Assuming that the witness's error rate remains the same in the real-world scenario, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black. Since the attacker's race is not white, the witness's chance of being wrong when seeing a black person is 20%.

But due to the city's demographics, there's a higher probability that the attacker is white (85%). So, if the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, they must have mistaken a white person for a black one. This error would happen 20% of the time when the witness sees a white person. Since the city is 85% white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness making an error by identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate isn't affected by the city's demographics, which might not be the case in reality.

Strictly speaking, without more information, it's difficult to provide a precise probability estimate. But based on the given information, it seems that the attacker might be more likely to be white than black, despite the witness's identification.
