To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct identification and 20% error. Since we don't have any information about the racial composition of the group of people the witness was observing, we'll assume an equal distribution of white and black people (50% each) for simplicity.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (from the witness reliability), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of an attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is therefore 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness is more likely to miss identifying white people).

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white, which would be necessary to complete the calculation. Therefore, we can only provide an estimate based on the information given about the witness's reliability and the city's racial composition.

Given the witness's 80% correct identification rate and the city's racial composition, it seems likely that the attacker is black. However, without more information, we can't provide a precise probability.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, but the witness's reliability and the city's racial composition suggest a high probability that the attacker is black}
