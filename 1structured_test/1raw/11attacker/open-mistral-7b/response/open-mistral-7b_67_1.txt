To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be attributable to misidentifying whites as blacks or vice versa, then the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (80%) and the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, which is 0.8.

However, we also need to take into account the racial composition of the city's population. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that a random person in the city is black is 0.15.

If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that A is true given that B is true
- P(B|A) is the probability that B is true given that A is true
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. We have calculated P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B), we can use the fact that the probability of a single event (in this case, the witness's identification) is the sum of the probabilities of its possible outcomes (correct identification or error):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \* P(\neg A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.333

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 33.3%. This means that there is a slightly higher than one-third chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be a valid assumption in practice.
