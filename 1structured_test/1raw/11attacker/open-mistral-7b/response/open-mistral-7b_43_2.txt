Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the city's population.

First, let's consider the racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.

Next, let's consider the witness's reliability: the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black by considering both the racial distribution of the city and the witness's reliability.

If the attacker was indeed black, the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%). If the attacker was white, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (15% white population times 20% error rate).

Therefore, the total probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.03 (the second term is 0 because a correct identification of a white person as white does not contribute to the error rate).

So, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of a correct identification of a black person divided by the sum of the probabilities of a correct identification of a black person and the probability of an error in identifying a white person:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03) = 0.12 / 0.18 = 0.67 (approximately)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.67 (67%).
