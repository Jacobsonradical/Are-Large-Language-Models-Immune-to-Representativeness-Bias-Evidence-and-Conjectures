To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is the error rate mentioned in the first piece of information: 0.2 (or 20%).

Since 85% of the population is white, P(white) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black, is 1 - error rate = 0.8.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as white, given that the attacker is actually black. Let's denote this probability as P(white|black).

Given the information that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this happening if the attacker is black is P(black) * P(black|black) + P(white|black) * P(white).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this probability should equal 1. Therefore, we can write the equation:

P(black) * P(black|black) + P(white|black) * P(white) = 1

We know P(black|black) = 0.8 and P(white) = 0.85. We can solve for P(black) by rearranging the equation:

P(black) = (1 - P(white|black)) / 0.8

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine P(white|black). Therefore, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for P(black).

However, we can make an educated guess based on the error rate and the racial composition of the city. Since the error rate is relatively high (20%), it suggests that the witness may not be very reliable at identifying race, especially in low light conditions. Given that 85% of the population is white, it might be more likely that the attacker is white, even if the witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, our guess would be lower than 0.8, but we cannot provide a specific number without more information.
