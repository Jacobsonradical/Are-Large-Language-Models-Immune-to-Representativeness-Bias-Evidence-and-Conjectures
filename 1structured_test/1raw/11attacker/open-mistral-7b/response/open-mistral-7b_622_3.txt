To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. We know that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the witness witnessed an attack by a person of either race (black or white) with equal probability. In this case, the probability of the witness making a correct identification is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying blacks, plus the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying whites.

Given that the total population is 100% white + black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%), and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability of the witness making a correct identification is (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8.

However, we know that the witness actually made a correct identification. Therefore, the observed probability of a correct identification is equal to the probability of the attacker being black. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8.

Therefore, {probability: 0.8} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
