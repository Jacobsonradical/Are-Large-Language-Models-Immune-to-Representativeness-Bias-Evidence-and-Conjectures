Based on the information provided, there are two sources of evidence regarding the attacker's race: the demographics of the city and the witness's testimony.

1. Demographics of the city: The city is 85% white and 15% black. This means the probability that a randomly selected attacker is black is 0.15.

2. Witness testimony: The witness identified the attacker as black, but has an error rate of 20% in such identifications. This means that when the witness thinks they are seeing a black person, they are actually mistaken 20% of the time. In other words, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability that the witness's identification is correct in this specific case. We know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, but we don't know whether this error rate applies to times when the witness correctly identifies the race or when the witness makes a mistake.

Therefore, while the demographic information gives us a baseline probability of 0.15, we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony alone, as we cannot account for potential biases or errors in the witness's identification.
