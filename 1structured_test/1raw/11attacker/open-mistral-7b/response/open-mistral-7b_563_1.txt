Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time, so we can assume that they correctly identified race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, we can expect the witness to correctly identify a white attacker 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68% of the time. Similarly, they should correctly identify a black attacker 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% of the time.

However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means they should have incorrectly identified a white attacker 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, this means the actual probability of a black attacker is higher than 12%.

The total probability of the witness's incorrect identification (both incorrectly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker) is 0.2 + 0.12 = 0.32 or 32%.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is the ratio of the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker to the total probability of the witness's incorrect identification: 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375 or 37.5%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.375} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.
