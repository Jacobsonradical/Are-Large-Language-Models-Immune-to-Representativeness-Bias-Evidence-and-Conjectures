To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random (i.e., they are just as likely to mistake a white person for black as they are to mistake a black person for white), then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, and P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black.

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(~A) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.234 or 23.4%.
