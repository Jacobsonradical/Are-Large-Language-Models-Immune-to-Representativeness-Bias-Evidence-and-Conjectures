Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, i.e., the proportion of black people in the city (given in b as 0.15 or 15%)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is black (given in a as 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is not black (given in a as 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black, i.e., the proportion of white people in the city (given in b as 0.85 or 85%)
- P(W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Simplifying the expression, we find:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.235

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.5%.
