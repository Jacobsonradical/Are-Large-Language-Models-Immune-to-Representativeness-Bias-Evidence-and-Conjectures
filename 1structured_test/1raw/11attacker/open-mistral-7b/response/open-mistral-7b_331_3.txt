Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the city's demographics in point b: 15% black and 85% white.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is the witness's accuracy rate in point a: 80%. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is the false positive rate in point a: 20%.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the event given the evidence is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event (attacker is black), B is the evidence (witness identification), P(A) is the prior probability of A, P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A, and P(B) is the probability of B.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.
