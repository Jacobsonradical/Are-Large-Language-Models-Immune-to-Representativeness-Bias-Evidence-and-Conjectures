To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly by the victim, we can assume that the witness's testimony is the only available information. Therefore, we can use the witness's reliability as a probability.

However, the witness's testimony is not perfect. If we assume that the witness errs randomly, then there is a 20% chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black in the city is 0.15 (15%). However, considering the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 12%. This means that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, and there is a 88% chance that the attacker is white. This estimate is lower than the actual racial composition of the city due to the witness's error rate.
