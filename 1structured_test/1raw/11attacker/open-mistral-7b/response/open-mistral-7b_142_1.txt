To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's racial identification in this particular case.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. However, we do not have specific information about the witness's performance in this specific scenario, which could have been influenced by factors such as lighting, distance, or stress.

Given that we cannot make a definitive assumption about the witness's accuracy in this specific case, we can only consider the general probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics:

{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This probability is based on the fact that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. It's important to note that this is a simplistic interpretation and does not take into account the witness's statement or any other potential evidence. For a more accurate assessment, further investigation and analysis would be required.
