Given the information provided, we can approach this problem by considering the reliability of the witness and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now let's calculate the probabilities:

- If the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%).
- If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.2 / (0.85 + 0.15 * 0.2) = 0.027 (approximately 2.7%).

The total probability of the witness's statement being true (either the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him, or the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him) is the sum of these probabilities: 0.8 + 0.027 â‰ˆ 0.827 (approximately 82.7%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.827, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
