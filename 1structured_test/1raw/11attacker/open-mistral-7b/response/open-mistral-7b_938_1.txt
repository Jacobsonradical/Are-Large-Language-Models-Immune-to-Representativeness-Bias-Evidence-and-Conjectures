Based on the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, P(A|B) is the probability we are trying to find, P(B|A) is the reliability of the witness's identification (0.8), P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15), and P(B) is the prior probability of the witness's identification being correct (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.21) = 0.5714

So our estimate, based on the witness's identification and the population statistics, is that there is a 57.14% probability that the attacker is black.
