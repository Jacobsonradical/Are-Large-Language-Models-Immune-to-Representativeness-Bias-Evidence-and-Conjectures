Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The racial distribution of the city's population, where 85% are white and 15% are black.
2. The witness's ability to identify race, which is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The Bayes' theorem formula is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this context:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know P(A) (the prior probability) is 0.15 (15% of the population is black). We also know P(B|A) (the likelihood) is 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case).

We are given P(B) (the marginal likelihood), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of whether the person is actually black or not. This is calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Using the given information, P(B|not A) (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black when the person is not black) is 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Therefore, P(B) is:

P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1-0.15)) = 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.18

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = (1 * 0.15) / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.8333

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83 (or 83%). This means that, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, it's important to remember that this is just an estimate and other factors could influence the actual probability.
