Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, in a controlled environment, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

When applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event of the attacker being black, and B is the event of the witness stating the attacker is black.

1. P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which is 15%.
2. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 80%.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness stating the attacker is black, given that the attacker could be either black or white. We can calculate this by considering both possibilities:
   a. If the attacker is black, the probability is 1 (since the witness stated so) * P(A) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15
   b. If the attacker is white, the probability is 0 (since the witness did not state so) * P(not A) = 0 * 0.85 = 0
   c. Therefore, P(B) = 0.15 (probability of witness stating black attacker if attacker is black) + 0 (probability of witness stating black attacker if attacker is white) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80) * (0.15) / (0.15) = 0.80

However, we're interested in the probability of the attacker being black, so we'll convert this back to a percentage:

{probability: 0.80 * 100 = 80%}
