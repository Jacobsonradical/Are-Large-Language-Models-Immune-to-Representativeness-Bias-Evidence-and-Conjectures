To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black and attributing the crime to a black person.

Let's denote P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black and P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white. Since the total probability of all outcomes must sum to 1, we have:

P(black) + P(white) = 1

We know that 85% of the city's population is white, so:

P(white) = 0.85

The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen white person is mistakenly identified as black is 0.20.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as black, and there is a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying a white person as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black as follows:

P(black) = 1 - P(white given black identified) * P(white) + P(white given black identified) * P(black)

Using the Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(black | identified as black) = P(identified as black | black) * P(black) / P(identified as black)

We know that P(identified as black | black) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).

We also know that P(black) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the city's population is black).

The probability of being identified as black, P(identified as black), is the sum of the probabilities of being a black person and being mistakenly identified as black:

P(identified as black) = P(black) * P(identified as black | black) + P(white) * P(identified as black | white)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, P(identified as black | white) = 0.20.

Using the given data, we have:

P(identified as black) = 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(black) = P(identified as black | black) * P(black) / P(identified as black)

P(black) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
