Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's identification accuracy for black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% white population, so 15% black population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness's identification accuracy in general)

We are given the following values:
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness's identification accuracy for black people)
- P(E) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.6 (the overall identification accuracy of the witness)

Using these values, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.6
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.233

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.3%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black and the witness's identification accuracy.
