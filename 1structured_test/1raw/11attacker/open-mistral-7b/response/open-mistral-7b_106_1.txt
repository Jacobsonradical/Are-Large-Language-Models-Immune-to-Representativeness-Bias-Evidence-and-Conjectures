To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identifies black) given the hypothesis (attacker is black).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness makes identification).

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black).
2. P(H) is not given, but we can estimate it using the population statistics. Given that 85% of the population is white, and the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% - 20% = 60% of the time. Since the witness's total accuracy is 80%, this means that the proportion of black people in the population must be 0.6 / 0.8 = 0.75. However, since the population is not necessarily exactly 75% black, a safer estimate for P(H) would be the actual proportion of black people in the population, which is given as 0.15.
3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the witness making any identification. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.83
          = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12, or 12%. However, we should keep in mind that this estimate is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability may be different.
