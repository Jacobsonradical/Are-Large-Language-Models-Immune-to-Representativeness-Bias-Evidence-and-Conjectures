To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's identification was incorrect 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

On the other hand, if the attacker was indeed black, there is a 80% chance that the witness would correctly identify them.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.20, which we can write as 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.80, which we can write as 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29}

So, our estimate is that there is a 29% chance that the attacker is black.
