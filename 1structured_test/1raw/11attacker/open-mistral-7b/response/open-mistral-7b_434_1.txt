To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying races and a 20% error rate. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as black, which means they made an error in this particular case.

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the probability of a random attacker being black is 0.15.

The witness's error rate of 20% means that in 20% of their identifications, they will incorrectly identify a white person as black. This means that if the attacker was actually white, there's a 20% chance the witness would still identify them as black.

Since the city is 85% white, there's a 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%) chance that a random white person will be misidentified as black by the witness.

The total probability of the witness misidentifying a white person and the attacker actually being white is 0.17 + 0.15 = 0.32 (or 32%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means the actual attacker cannot be one of the 0.32 of the time the witness would make such an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 (or 68%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68}.
