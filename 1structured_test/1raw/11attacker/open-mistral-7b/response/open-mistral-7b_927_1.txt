To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is not black given the witness's statement

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B) = probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's identification accuracy for black people)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness's identification error rate for non-black people)
- P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (total population probability)
- P(B) = 0.15 (from the city's demographic information) (this is our prior probability)

We need to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, given the witness's statement and the city's demographic information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
