To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the events as follows:

- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the race of a person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.2.
2. The prior probability of the attacker being black is P(A). We don't know this probability yet, but we will calculate it using Bayes' theorem.

We are also given the population distribution:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the first piece of information)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (given in the first piece of information, where ~A denotes the attacker is not black)
- P(A) = ? (the probability we are trying to find)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We are given P(B|A), P(B|~A), and the city's population distribution. To find P(A), we can use the second piece of information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.53

So, based on the given information, the witness's testimony, and the city's population distribution, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.53 or 53%.
