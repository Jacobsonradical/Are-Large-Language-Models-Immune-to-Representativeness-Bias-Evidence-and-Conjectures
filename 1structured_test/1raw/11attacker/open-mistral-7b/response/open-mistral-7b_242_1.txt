Based on the information provided, the witness has a 80% probability of correctly identifying a person's race, and a 20% probability of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this as a correct identification in 80% of the cases.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This means that even if the witness is correct in their identification, there is a higher probability that the attacker is white.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (which we know is 0.8). Let P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (which we know is 0.2). Let P(B|W) be the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person (which we are trying to find).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Since we know P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|~B) = 0.2, and P(B) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white), we can calculate P(B|W).

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, based on the evidence provided by the witness, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be different in reality.
