Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the city's racial demographics.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race directly, we need to consider both the city's demographics and the witness's error rate.
4. If we assume that the attacker is actually white, then the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black is 20%.
5. On the other hand, if the attacker is black, then the probability that the witness would correctly identify them is 80%.
6. To estimate the overall probability that the attacker is black, we need to take into account the city's demographics and the witness's error rate.
7. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B). Then, the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as black is P(B) * 0.8 (given that the attacker is black).
8. The probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white attacker as black is (1 - P(B)) * 0.2 (given that the attacker is white).
9. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation based on the probabilities of these two scenarios: 0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * (1 - P(B)) = 0.8 (given that the witness's identification is accurate).
10. Solving for P(B), we get: P(B) = 0.75

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.75 or 75%.
