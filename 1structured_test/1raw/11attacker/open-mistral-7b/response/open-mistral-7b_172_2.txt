Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy in identifying race is only 80% under similar conditions.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, this means they mistakenly identified a white person as black 20% of the time when they saw a half white and half black sample. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a chance they could have made this error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we need to account for this possibility. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is P(white) = 0.85.

The witness correctly identified the attacker as black with a probability of P(correctly identified | black) = 0.8.

However, there's also a chance the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black with a probability of P(incorrectly identified | white) = 0.2.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact proportion of times the witness made this error in this specific situation, let's assume it's the same 20% error rate as in the sample. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black when they saw the attacker is P(incorrectly identified | black) = 0.

Now, we can set up a Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(black) = P(correctly identified | black) * P(black) / [P(correctly identified | black) * P(black) + P(incorrectly identified | white) * P(white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(black) = 0.12 / 0.22

P(black) = 0.545

So, based on the given information and assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.55 or 55%.
