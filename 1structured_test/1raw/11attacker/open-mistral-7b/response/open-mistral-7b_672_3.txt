Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker's race (black or white). The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let P(B) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we can estimate from the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15).

Let P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the problem: P(W|B) = 0.8).

Let P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is white, this probability can be estimated as P(W|~B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).

Let P(~B) be the probability of the attacker being white (which can be calculated as P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (the likelihood), can be calculated as P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white (the error probability), can be calculated as P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1465.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.12 + 0.1465 = 0.2665.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem: P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W) = (0.12) / 0.2665 â‰ˆ 0.452.

So, based on the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.452 or 45.2%.
