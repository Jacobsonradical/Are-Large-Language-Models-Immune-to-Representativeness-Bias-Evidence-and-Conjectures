Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote W as the event "witness correctly identifies attacker's race" and E as the event "attacker is black."

We know that P(W|E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black person 80% of the time) and P(W|~E) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies black person 20% of the time).

Let P(E) be the probability that the attacker is black. We want to find P(E).

The witness's overall accuracy in identifying race is P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|~E) * P(~E) = 0.8 * P(E) + 0.2 * (1 - P(E)).

We have another equation based on the population statistics: P(E) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Substitute this into the first equation: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2.

However, this result seems inconsistent with the witness's accuracy rate. The discrepancy might be due to the simplifying assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is the same for all races. Given the limited information, it's unclear how to reconcile this discrepancy.

Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
