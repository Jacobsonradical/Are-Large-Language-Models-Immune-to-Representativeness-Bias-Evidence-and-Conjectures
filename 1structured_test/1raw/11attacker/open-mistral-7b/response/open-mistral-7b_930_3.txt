Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, because we do not know if the witness's identification was correct or not.

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% based on the city's population)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (80%)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (20%)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (1-P(B) = 85%)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a non-black person (1-P(W|~B) = 20%)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. According to Bayes' theorem, this is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.27

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 27%.
