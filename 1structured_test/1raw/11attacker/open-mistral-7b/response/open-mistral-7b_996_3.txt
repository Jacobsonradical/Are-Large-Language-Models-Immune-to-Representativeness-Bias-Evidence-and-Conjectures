To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In our case:
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness's testimony that the attacker is black.

We are given:
1. P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time)
2. P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness testified that the attacker is black, and if the attacker is indeed black, this testimony is true)
3. P(A) = The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we need to estimate.
4. P(B) = The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is black, which can be calculated using the information about the racial composition of the city.

Given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, the probability of an arbitrary person being white is 0.85, and the probability of an arbitrary person being black is 0.15.

So, P(B) = P(the witness testifies that the attacker is black | the attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) + P(the witness testifies that the attacker is black | the attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

P(B) = (witness's error rate * probability of attacker being white) + (1 * probability of attacker being black)
P(B) = (0.2 * 0.85) + (1 * 0.15)
P(B) = 0.17 + 0.15
P(B) = 0.32

Now, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (1 * P(A)) / 0.32

To find the value of P(A), we can solve the equation for P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B)
P(A) = (1 * 0.32) / 0.8
P(A) = 0.16 / 0.8
P(A) = 0.2

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 or 20%.
