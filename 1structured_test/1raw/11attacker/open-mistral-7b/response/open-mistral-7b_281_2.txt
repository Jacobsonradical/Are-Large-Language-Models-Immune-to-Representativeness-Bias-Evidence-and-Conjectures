To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If the witness says that the attacker is black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability that the witness is correct plus the probability that the witness is wrong and the attacker is still black (due to the racial demographics of the city).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W). From the given information, we know that P(B) + P(W) = 1.

The probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is black is P(B), and the probability that the witness is incorrect (and still identifies the attacker as black) is 1 - P(B) times the probability of the attacker being black given the city's demographics.

The probability of the attacker being black given the city's demographics is P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Therefore, the probability that the witness is incorrect and still identifies the attacker as black is (1 - P(B)) * P(B) = (1 - 0.15) * 0.15 = 0.135.

The probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is black is 0.80 (the witness's reliability in such situations).

So, the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black and the attacker is actually black is 0.80 + 0.135 = 0.935.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is P(B) = 0.935 / (0.935 + 0.065) = 0.935 / 1 = 1.

However, the probability must be between 0 and 1. This shows that the witness's statement is not sufficient to determine the attacker's race with certainty, even given the racial demographics of the city. The most reasonable estimate would be the probability that the witness is correct, which is 0.80.
