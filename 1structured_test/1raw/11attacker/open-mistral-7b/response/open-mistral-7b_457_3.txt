Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental formula in probability theory that relates observed events to their probabilities. In this case, we have two events: the event "Attacker is black" (A) and the event "Witness identifies attacker as black" (B).

The Bayes' theorem formula is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Let's break it down:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15%. So, P(A) = 0.15.
2. P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is given as 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
3. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
4. P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.33

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 33%.
