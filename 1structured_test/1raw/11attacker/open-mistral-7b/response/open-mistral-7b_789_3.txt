Based on the information provided, the population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't ignore this information. The witness's incorrect identification rate of 20% suggests that they may have mistakenly identified a white person as black. But since we don't have any information about the number of white and black people in the specific area where the attack occurred, we can't directly calculate the probability of a misidentification.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the population breakdown and the witness's identification accuracy. If we assume that the attack happened in an area with a similar racial distribution to the city as a whole, then there would be a higher probability of a white person being present. In this case, the witness's 20% error rate could imply a higher likelihood of a white person being misidentified as black.

But without more information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability. Therefore, I would suggest a cautious estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, to be around 80% (the witness's identified probability), but with a significant caveat that this is a rough estimate based on the given information.

{probability: 0.8, caveat: "This estimate is based on the assumption that the attack occurred in an area with a similar racial distribution to the city as a whole, and that the witness's error rate mainly affects the identification of white people as black."}
