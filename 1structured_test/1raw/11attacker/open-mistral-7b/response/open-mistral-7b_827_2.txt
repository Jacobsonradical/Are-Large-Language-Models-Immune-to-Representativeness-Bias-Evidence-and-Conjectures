To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

First, let's define our variables:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence, which is the witness's identification
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which can be estimated from the city's demographics given in part b
- P(E|H): The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black
- P(E|~H): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black
- P(~H): The probability of the attacker not being black

From part a, we know that P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2. From part b, we know that P(H) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white) and P(~H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3571, or 35.71%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 35.71%.
