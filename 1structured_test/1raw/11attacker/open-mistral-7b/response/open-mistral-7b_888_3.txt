Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying race, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(B). Since the witness is not perfect, we know that P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time), and P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time).

Given that the witness said the attacker was black, we can write the following Bayes' theorem equation:

P(B | Witness says black) = P(Witness says black | B) * P(B) / [P(Witness says black | B) * P(B) + P(Witness says black | not B) * P(not B)]

Substitute the given probabilities:

P(B | Witness says black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.168 = 0.7142857143

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.71 or 71%.
