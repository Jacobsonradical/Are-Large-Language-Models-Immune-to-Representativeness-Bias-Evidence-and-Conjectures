Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's demographics.
2. The likelihood of the witness's mistake, which could lead to incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being black:
   Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 15/100 = 0.15 or 15%.

2. The likelihood of the witness's mistake:
   If the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time, that means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Let's assume that the attacker's race is actually white. Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as white is 0.8. However, we're interested in the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white. This is the complement of the probability of correctly identifying the attacker as white:
   P(witness mistakes) = 1 - P(witness does not mistake) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Since we cannot know whether the witness's mistake actually occurred or not, we should consider both possibilities equally likely:

1. If the witness did not mistake, the attacker is indeed black, with a probability of 0.15.
2. If the witness did mistake, the attacker is actually white, but the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, with a probability of 0.2.

The total probability of the attacker being black, taking into account the possibility of the witness's mistake, is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(attacker is black) = 0.15 * P(no mistake) + 0.2 * P(mistake) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.15 + 0.04 = 0.19 or 19%.

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 19%. However, it's important to note that this is a Bayesian estimate and relies on certain assumptions, including the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant and independent of the actual race of the person. In reality, these assumptions may not hold, and there could be other factors at play that are not accounted for in this analysis.
