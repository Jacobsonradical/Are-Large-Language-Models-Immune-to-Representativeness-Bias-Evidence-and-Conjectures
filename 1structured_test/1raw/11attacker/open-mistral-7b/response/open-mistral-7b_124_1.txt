Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

This means that when the witness identifies a person as black, there's a 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97 = 97% chance that the person is actually black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 0.97.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.97}
