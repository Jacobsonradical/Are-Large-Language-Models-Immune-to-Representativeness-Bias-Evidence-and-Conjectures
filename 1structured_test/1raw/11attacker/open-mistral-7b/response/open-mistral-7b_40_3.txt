Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is approximately 80% accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is independent of the racial composition of the city. This means that the probability of the attacker being black is the same as the proportion of black people in the city.

However, we also need to account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, but there is a 20% chance of error, there might be a 20% chance that the attacker is actually white, even though the witness identified them as black.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies attacker's race | attacker is black)

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (from the racial composition of the city).

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, as we mentioned earlier, this is based on the assumption that the attacker's race is independent of the racial composition of the city. If there is a relationship between the two, the probability could be different.
