Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it means they erred in their judgment.

The probability that the witness made an error given a white person is 20% (error rate). However, we need to adjust this probability to account for the fact that the attacker is more likely to be white due to the city's demographics.

The probability of picking a white person at random in the city is 0.85, and the probability of picking a black person is 0.15. The probability of the witness making an error given a white person is 0.2 (20%), so the probability of the witness making an error given a black person is:

0.2 * (1 / 0.85) = 0.2353

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of picking a black person multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error given a black person:

0.15 * 0.2353 = 0.0353

So, the probability estimate that the attacker is black is approximately 0.0353 or 3.53%. This means that it is significantly less likely that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, than would be expected based on the city's demographics.
