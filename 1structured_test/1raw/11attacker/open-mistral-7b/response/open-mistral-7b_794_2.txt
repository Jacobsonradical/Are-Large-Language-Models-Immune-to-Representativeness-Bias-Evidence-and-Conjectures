Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's race, we can't directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this situation. But we can use the city's population statistics as a proxy for the attacker's likely race, assuming the attacker is a random member of the city's population.

Given that 15% of the city's population is black, this would be our best estimate for the attacker's race, assuming no other information is available.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
