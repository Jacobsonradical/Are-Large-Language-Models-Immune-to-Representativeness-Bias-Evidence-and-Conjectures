The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed among the population, then the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is equal to the probability of misidentifying a black person as white. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of misidentifying a white person as black as follows:

Probability of misidentifying white person as black = Probability of choosing a white person * Probability of misidentifying white person as black | white person
                                                                 = 0.85 * 0.20
                                                                 = 0.17

Now, since the probability of misidentifying a black person as white is also 0.20, the overall error rate in the witness's racial identification is 0.17 + 0.20 = 0.37.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black, which means they made an accurate identification in this case. The probability of this happening if the attacker is actually black is 1 (since they correctly identified the attacker's race).

On the other hand, if the attacker is white, there is a 0.37 probability that the witness will misidentify them as black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the total probability of either correctly identifying a black person or mistakenly identifying a white person as black:

{probability: 1 / (1 + 0.37), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The answer is approximately 0.21 or 21%.
