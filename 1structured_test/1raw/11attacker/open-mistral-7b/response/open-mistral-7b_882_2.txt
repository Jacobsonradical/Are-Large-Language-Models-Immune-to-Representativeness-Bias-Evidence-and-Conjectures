Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not known to be particularly reliable in identifying race, correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

Let's assume that the witness's errors are random and not biased toward any race. This means that when the witness makes a mistake, they are just as likely to misidentify a white person as a black person (or vice versa).

When the witness correctly identifies a black person, it's likely that the person is actually black, given the racial demographics of the city. However, when the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, it's actually a false positive.

Given that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, in 20% of the cases, they will incorrectly identify a white person as black. In these cases, the attacker is actually white, but the witness misperceived them as black.

So, to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the true black population proportion (15%) and the proportion of black individuals that the witness correctly identifies (80% of their correct identifications).

However, we also need to subtract the proportion of false positives (white individuals misidentified as black), which is the error rate (20%) multiplied by the proportion of whites in the population (85%): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.277 or 27.7%}

This estimate suggests that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, given the witness's identification, but the actual probability is still below the black population proportion. This could indicate that the witness's reliability in identifying race is lower than suggested by their correct identification rate.
