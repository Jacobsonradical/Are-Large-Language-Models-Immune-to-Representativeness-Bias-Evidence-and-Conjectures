To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black even if the attacker was white. This probability is equal to the witness's error rate (20%) times the probability of the attacker being white (85%).

Error rate * Probability of attacker being white = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, subtract this calculated probability from 1 to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

1 - Error rate * Probability of attacker being white = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83 or 83%.
