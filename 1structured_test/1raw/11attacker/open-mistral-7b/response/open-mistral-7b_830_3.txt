To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness testimony). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identifies a black person as black) given the hypothesis. This is given in the information as 0.8 (80%).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (attacker being black). This is what we want to update based on the new evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identifies a black person as black or white as black). This is given by the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H denotes not black (attacker being white). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

So, we have:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
         = (0.8 * P(H)) / (0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)))

We don't know the exact value of P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. However, we can use the given information about the population to make an educated guess. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that P(H) is approximately 0.15 (15%).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(H|E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
        ≈ 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.06)
        ≈ 0.12 / 0.18
        ≈ 0.67

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.67, or 67%. This means that, based on the witness's testimony and the given information about the population, we believe there is a 67% chance that the attacker is black.
