Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of a correct identification by the witness.

The probability of a correct identification is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%). Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
