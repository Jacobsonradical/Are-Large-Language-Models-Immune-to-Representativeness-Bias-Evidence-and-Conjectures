To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W).

Given the witness's reliability, we can say that when the attacker is black (B), the witness will correctly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8. Conversely, when the attacker is white (W), the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 0.2.

We have two pieces of information from the witness:
1. If the attacker is black, the witness says the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8.
2. If the attacker is white, the witness says the attacker is black with a probability of 0.2.

The probability that the witness says the attacker is black can be expressed as a weighted sum of these two cases:

P(Witness says black) = P(B) * 0.8 + P(W) * 0.2

However, we know that the witness said the attacker is black. So, we can set the probability that the witness says the attacker is black equal to 1:

1 = P(B) * 0.8 + P(W) * 0.2

Now, we can solve for P(B) by isolating it:

P(B) = (1 - P(W) * 0.2) / 0.8

Since P(W) is the probability of the attacker being white, we can find it by subtracting P(B) from 1:

P(W) = 1 - P(B)

Given the racial composition of the city, P(W) should be approximately 0.15, and P(B) should be approximately 0.85. However, we need to use the witness's racial identification reliability to find the actual values.

Substituting P(W) = 0.15 into the equation above, we get:

P(B) = (1 - 0.15 * 0.2) / 0.8

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.73125

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 73.13%.
