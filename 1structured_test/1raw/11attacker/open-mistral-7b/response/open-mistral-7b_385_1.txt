Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is black"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as black"
- W as the event "the population is white" (complement of A)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem)
- P(W) = 0.85 (given in the problem)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person)
- P(B|W) = 0.2 (the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a white person as black)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|W) * P(W)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41.
