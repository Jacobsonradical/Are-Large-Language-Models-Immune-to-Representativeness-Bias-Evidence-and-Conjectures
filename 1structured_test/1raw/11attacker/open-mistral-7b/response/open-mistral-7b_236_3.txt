Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is estimated as follows:

1. From information "a", we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. From information "b", we know that the witness accurately identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to occur when identifying black people as white or white people as black.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, due to the lack of information about the witness's error rate when identifying black people specifically, we cannot accurately adjust the initial city population percentages.
4. Therefore, based on the information given, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is the initial population percentage, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
