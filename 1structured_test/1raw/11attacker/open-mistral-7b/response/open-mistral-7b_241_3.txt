Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 0.8 or 80%)
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (since the witness identifies people correctly 80% of the time, this must be 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2 or 20%)

The witness identified the attacker as black, so we are interested in the probability P(B|W), which is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, this probability can be calculated as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)] = 0.12 or 12%

So, based on the available information and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
