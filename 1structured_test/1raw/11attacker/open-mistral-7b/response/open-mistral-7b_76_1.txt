To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

First, let's denote the events:
- A: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information given, we know two probabilities:
- P(A): the prior probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: 15% = 0.15)
- P(E|A): the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (given by the witness's accuracy: 0.8)

We also know that:
- P(E|not A): the probability of the witness erroneously identifying an attacker as black if the attacker is not black (given by the witness's error rate: 0.2)

Now, we want to find P(A|E), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(E|A) and P(A), so we can find P(A|E).

P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this, we find P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.412, or 41.2%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, there is about a 41.2% chance that the attacker is black.
