Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with a 20% error rate. Since the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Let P(B|not A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is the same as the probability that the attacker is white).

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since half the time the witness correctly identifies the race, P(B|A) = 0.5.

The probability of the witness making the observation B is the sum of the probability of event A (attacker is black) and the probability of event not A (attacker is not black) times the corresponding probability of the witness making the observation:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B) from the witness's statement, so we can rearrange the equation to find P(A):

P(A) = P(B) / (P(B|A) + P(B|not A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A) = 0.8 / (0.5 + 0.2)

P(A) = 0.8 / 0.7

P(A) â‰ˆ 0.57143

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.57 or 57%.
