Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's statement about the attacker's race is an observation with a certain probability of being correct or incorrect. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the true race of the attacker, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Similarly, let P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

By Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) \* P(B) / (P(W|B) \* P(B) + P(W|~B) \* P(~B))

We are given P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|~B) = 0.2. We can calculate P(B) and P(~B) using the city's population statistics. P(B) = 0.15 (15%), and P(~B) = 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B|W), we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is significantly lower than the witness's statement, suggesting that the witness may have made an error in their identification. This illustrates the challenges and limitations of relying on eyewitness testimony.
