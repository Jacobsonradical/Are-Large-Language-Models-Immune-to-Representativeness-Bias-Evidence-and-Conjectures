Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's description of the attacker

The prior probability of H (P(H)) is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. We are given this information in part b: P(H) = 15%.

The likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)) is the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given in part a as 80%.

The likelihood of E given not-H (P(E|not-H)) is the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is not black with probability 1 - P(H) = 0.85, and the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The posterior probability of H given E (P(H|E)) is what we are interested in. It is calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H))

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is 12%.
