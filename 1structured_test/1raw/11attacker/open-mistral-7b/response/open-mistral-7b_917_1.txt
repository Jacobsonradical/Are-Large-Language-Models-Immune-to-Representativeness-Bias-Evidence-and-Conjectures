To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence,
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which is what we want to find,
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

In this case, H = "The attacker is black", E = "The witness identified the attacker as black".

From the information given, we have:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
2. P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
3. P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)
   P(E | not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time)
   P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

   So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.611

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.611 or 61.1%.
