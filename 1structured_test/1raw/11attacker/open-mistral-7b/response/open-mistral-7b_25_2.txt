Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so the probability of the attacker being black is 15%)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(H|E) is what we want to find
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  Where ~H is the complementary hypothesis (attacker is white)
  P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time when the person is white)
  P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being white, given that 85% of the population is white)

Calculating P(E):
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.34 or 34%.
