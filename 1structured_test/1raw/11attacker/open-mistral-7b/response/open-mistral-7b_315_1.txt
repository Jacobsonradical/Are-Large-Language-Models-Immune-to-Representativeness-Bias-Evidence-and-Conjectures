Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event and the witness's observation is also a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event of the attacker being black, and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We know P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black) is 0.8 (from the first piece of information). We also know P(A) (the probability of the attacker being black) which we are trying to find. And we know P(B) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black), which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black).

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B|not A) as 0.2.

We also know the population distribution, P(not A) = 0.85 (from the second piece of information).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(A): P(A) = (P(B) - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

Substituting the values for P(B) from the witness's ability to identify race, we get: P(A) = (0.8 - 0.17) / 0.8 = 0.6875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.6875 or 68.75%.
