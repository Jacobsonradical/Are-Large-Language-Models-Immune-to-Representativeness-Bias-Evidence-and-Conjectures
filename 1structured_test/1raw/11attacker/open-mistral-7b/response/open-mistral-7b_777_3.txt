Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the statistics provided, 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, whose accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the population (which is not necessarily the case, but we don't have enough information to account for any potential biases), then the attacker should be white with a probability of 0.85 and black with a probability of 0.15.

However, the witness provided an identification that deviates from these probabilities. Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time, we need to adjust our estimate to account for this error rate.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (the error rate).

Given the witness's identification of the attacker as black, the probability of this event occurring if the attacker is actually white is P(white) * 0.2 = 0.17 (since 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).

On the other hand, the probability of this event occurring if the attacker is actually black is P(black) * 0.2 = 0.03 (since 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set the likelihood of the event given each hypothesis equal to the probability of the event occurring if the hypothesis is true:

P(witness's identification | attacker is white) = 0.17
P(witness's identification | attacker is black) = 0.03

Given these probabilities, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(witness's identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness's identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) + P(witness's identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = (0.03 * 0.15) / [(0.17 * 0.85) + (0.03 * 0.15)] = 0.0225 / (0.1455 + 0.0225) = 0.0225 / 0.168 = 0.133

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is about 13.3%. This suggests that the witness's identification may not be reliable, as it is significantly lower than the actual population statistics. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis and may not fully capture the complexities of the situation.
