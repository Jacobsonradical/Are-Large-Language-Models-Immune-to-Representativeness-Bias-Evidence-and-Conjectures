Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black without considering the witness's error rate. Since we do not know if the witness made an error or not, we need to account for both possibilities.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker is black
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race
- ~W as the event that the witness makes an error in identifying the attacker's race

We are given that P(W|E) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black) and P(~W|E) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as something other than black).

We are also given that the population is 85% white and 15% black. Let's denote:
- P(E) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(~E) as the probability that the attacker is not black (white)

We are given that P(E) + P(~E) = 1, and P(~E) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

Now we can set up a probability equation based on the information given:

P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|~E) * P(~E)

We are not given any information about P(W|~E), but since P(W|E) = 0.8, it is reasonable to assume that P(W|~E) is lower than 0.8, since the witness is less likely to correctly identify a white person as black than a black person as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

Where P(W) is calculated as above, and P(E) is the probability we are trying to estimate.

However, without more information about P(W|~E), it is not possible to provide a specific number for P(E|W). We can only say that based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.2 (since P(W|E) = 0.8), but less than 1 (since P(W|~E) < 0.8).

Therefore, the best estimate we can provide is:
{probability: some value between 0.2 and 1, but without more information, we cannot provide a specific number}
