Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the probability before new evidence) with the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

The prior probability (P(H)) is the probability that the attacker is black, given the racial distribution of the city. Since 15% of the population is black, the prior probability would be 0.15.

The likelihood (P(E|H)) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black. In this case, since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the likelihood of this error is 0.20 (1 - 0.80).

The posterior probability (P(H|E)) is the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

However, we do not have the value of P(E), the probability of the witness's identification independent of the race of the attacker. To account for this uncertainty, Bayes' theorem can still be used in a simplified form by assuming that the prior probability and the likelihood are equally likely, which means that P(E) = P(H) + P(~H), where ~H is the complement of H (not black).

Since we only know the prior probability P(H) and the likelihood P(E|H), we can simplify Bayes' theorem and get an estimate of the posterior probability:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Since we do not have the value of P(E|~H), the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, we cannot calculate the exact probability. However, this simplified Bayes' theorem estimate would still favor the prior probability, which is 0.15, indicating that the attacker is more likely to be white based on the racial distribution of the city.

In conclusion, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in the required format. The simplified Bayes' theorem estimate suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white, but it does not completely rule out the possibility that the attacker is black.
