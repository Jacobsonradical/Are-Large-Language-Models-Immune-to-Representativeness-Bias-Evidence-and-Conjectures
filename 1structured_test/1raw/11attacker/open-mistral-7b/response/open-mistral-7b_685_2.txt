To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as P_witness_correct, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as P_witness_error.

From the information given, we know that P_witness_correct + P_witness_error = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time).

The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is P_witness_error * 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is P_witness_correct * 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

We are interested in the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Let's denote this probability as P(attacker is black | witness's identification).

Given the witness's identification, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race, in which case the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this scenario is P_witness_correct * 0.15.

2. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race, in which case the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black. The probability of this scenario is P_witness_error * 0.85.

The total probability of these two scenarios is P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P_witness_correct * 0.15 + P_witness_error * 0.85.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P_witness_correct and P_witness_error directly. We can only make an estimate based on the given information.

Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and there are twice as many white people as black people, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness is more likely to correctly identify a white person (due to their higher prevalence in the population). Therefore, we might expect that P_witness_error is higher than 0.2, and P_witness_correct is lower than 0.8.

However, without more specific information, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for P(attacker is black | witness's identification).

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, but an estimate could be in the range between 0.3 and 0.5, depending on the values of P_witness_correct and P_witness_error.}
