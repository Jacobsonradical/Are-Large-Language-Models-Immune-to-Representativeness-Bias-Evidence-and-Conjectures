To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness misidentifies race 20% of the time. So, when the witness says the attacker is black, there's a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. So, when the witness says the attacker is black, there's an 80% chance that the witness is correct and the attacker is actually black.

Now, let's consider the racial demographics of the city. The city is 85% white and 15% black. If the attacker is actually white, then the witness is incorrect 100% of the time (since the witness identified the attacker as black). However, if the attacker is black, then the witness is correct 80% of the time.

The key point is that the probability of the witness being correct is higher when the attacker is black than when the attacker is white. This is because the witness is more likely to correctly identify a black person than a white person.

So, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is black, divided by the sum of the probabilities that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is black, and the probability that the witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is white.

The probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8. The probability that the witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is white, is 1 (since the witness is always incorrect when the attacker is white).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 / (0.8 + 1) = 0.4.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4, or 40%.
