Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the population statistics and the witness's observations. The population statistics tell us the likelihood of an attacker being black or white in the city as a whole. The witness's accuracy tells us how often the witness correctly identifies black and white individuals in specific situations.

The witness's error rate is not directly relevant to the probability of the attacker's race because we don't know whether the witness erred in this instance or not. The witness could have correctly identified the attacker as black, or the witness could have erroneously identified the attacker as black.

Therefore, we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black using the given information. The witness's ability to identify race under specific conditions does not provide enough information to adjust the population statistics for this specific case.

In summary, {probability: unable to provide a number, as the information given does not allow for a reliable estimate}
