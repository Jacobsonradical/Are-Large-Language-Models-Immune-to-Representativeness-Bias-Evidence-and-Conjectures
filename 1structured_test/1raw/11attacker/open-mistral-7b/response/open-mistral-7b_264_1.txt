Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black conflicts with the victim's inability to see the attacker's race. To maintain consistency, we should use the racial composition of the city as our primary source of information.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15}

This estimate is based on the racial demographics of the city, which suggests that 15% of the population is black. It's important to note that if we were to use the witness's identification, the probability would be higher, but it conflicts with the information that the victim could not see the attacker's race.
