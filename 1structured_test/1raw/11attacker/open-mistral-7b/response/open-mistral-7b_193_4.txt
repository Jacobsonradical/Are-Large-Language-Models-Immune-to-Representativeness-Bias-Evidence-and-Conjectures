The probability estimate would be based on the reliability of the witness's race identification and the demographics of the city. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and considering that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Since we don't have sufficient information to distinguish between these two scenarios (witness erring or witness being correct), we can consider them as two equally likely events. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:

P(black) = P(witness is correct) + P(witness is wrong)
P(black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 29%.
