To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) when given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification and population data)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying race)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (combined probability of witness's identification and population data)

Given the information, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
  P(E | ¬H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying race for a white person)
  P(¬H) is the probability of the negation of the hypothesis (85% of the population is white)

Since we do not have the specific values for P(E | ¬H) and P(¬H), we cannot calculate the exact value of P(E). However, we can still make an approximate estimation by assuming that the witness's accuracy in identifying race is the same for white and black people (which is not necessarily true, but we are making an approximation to simplify the calculation).

Under this approximation, P(E | H) = P(E | ¬H) = 0.8. Then, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.84 ≈ 0.18

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18%. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and a more accurate calculation would require the specific values for P(E | ¬H) and P(¬H).
