Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not very reliable in identifying race (correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time), identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the probability that the attacker is black in the population and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We know that P(black) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is P(err|white) = 0.2 (20%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is truly black is the conditional probability P(black|identified as black).

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(black|identified as black) = P(identified as black|black) * P(black) / [P(identified as black|black) * P(black) + P(identified as black|not black) * P(not black)]

However, we don't have enough information about P(identified as black|not black) (the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black). Since we cannot calculate P(black|identified as black) with the given information, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate.

However, it's important to note that the witness's incorrect identification bias could potentially decrease the actual probability of the attacker being black. If the witness's bias is significant, then the probability that the attacker is truly black could be less than 15%. If the witness's bias is not significant, then the probability that the attacker is truly black could be close to 15%.

In conclusion, without more information, we cannot provide a specific probability estimate that the attacker is black.
