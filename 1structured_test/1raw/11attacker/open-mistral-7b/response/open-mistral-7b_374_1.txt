To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information to suggest that the witness is more likely to make an error in identifying a black person, we can assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two races.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the expected number of correctly identified black people and incorrectly identified black people based on the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the total number of people in the sample as S. The expected number of black people in the sample is 0.15 * S. The number of white people is 0.85 * S.

The witness correctly identifies black people 0.8 * 0.15 * S (80% of the time) and incorrectly identifies white people as black 0.2 * 0.85 * S (20% of the time).

The witness's identification of a black person as an attacker corresponds to either a correct identification or an incorrect identification of a black person. So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is the sum of the correct identifications and the incorrect identifications divided by the total number of people in the sample:

(0.8 * 0.15 * S + 0.2 * 0.85 * S) / S = 0.18 * S / S = 0.18

Since we don't have the exact number of people in the sample, we can only provide an estimate based on the given population statistics. The expected number of black people in the sample is 0.15 * S â‰ˆ 0.15 * 1000 = 150. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.18 or 18%.
