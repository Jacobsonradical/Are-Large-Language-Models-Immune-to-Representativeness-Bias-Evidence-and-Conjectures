Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's break this down:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know the following:
- Prior probability of A (P(A)): 15% (since 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black).
- Probability of B given A (P(B|A)): The witness is correct 80% of the time.
- Probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)): The witness is incorrect 20% of the time.

To find P(not A), we subtract P(A) from 1, so P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, we find that P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.27

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 27%.
