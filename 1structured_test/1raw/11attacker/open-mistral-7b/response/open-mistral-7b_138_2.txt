To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

Let's denote:
- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(incorrect) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white

We are given that P(black) + P(white) = 1, and that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8, and incorrectly identifies a black person as white with a probability of 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up the following conditional probabilities:

P(witness said "black" | attacker is black) = P(correct) = 0.8
P(witness said "black" | attacker is white) = P(incorrect) * P(white) = 0.2 * P(white)

Since the witness said "black", we can set up the following equation:

0.8 = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white)

Now we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 - 0.2 * P(white)) / 0.8

We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1, so we can rewrite P(white) in terms of P(black):

P(white) = 1 - P(black)

Now we can substitute P(white) into the equation for P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 - 0.2 * (1 - P(black))) / 0.8

Solving this equation gives us:

P(black) = 0.64

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.64, or 64%.
