The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the witness's ability to judge race and the racial distribution in the city, can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.
2. Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03.
4. Conversely, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.
5. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.97.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.97}.
