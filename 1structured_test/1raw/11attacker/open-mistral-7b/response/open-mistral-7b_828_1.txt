Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, with a slight bias towards identifying people as black.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the case at hand. The witness's accuracy rate applies to situations where the race is clear, but in this case, the victim could not see the attacker's race.

If we were to make an assumption that the witness's accuracy rate would still apply even in cases where the race is not clear, then we could estimate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

0.15 (probability of attacker being black in the city) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12 (estimated probability)

However, this assumption is not likely to be accurate, as the witness's accuracy rate is based on situations where the race is clear. In this case, the attack happened at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, it's unlikely that the witness's accuracy rate would apply to this situation.

Given this, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the information provided. It would require additional information or assumptions to make such an estimate.
