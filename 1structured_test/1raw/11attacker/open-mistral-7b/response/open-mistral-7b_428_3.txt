To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black. From the information, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H means not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2. So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
