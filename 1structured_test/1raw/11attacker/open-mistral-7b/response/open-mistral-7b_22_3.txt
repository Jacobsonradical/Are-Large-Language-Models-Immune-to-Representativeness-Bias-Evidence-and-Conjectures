To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, or the attacker is not black and the witness made an error.

1. The attacker is black: The probability of this event is the proportion of black people in the city, which we know is 15%.
2. The attacker is not black (witness made an error): The probability of this event is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 85%. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of erring when the attacker is actually white is 0.2.

Since we don't know which of these two events occurred, we should consider their probabilities and combine them using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Observation) = [P(Witness Observation | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Observation | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Observation | Attacker is Not Black) * P(Attacker is Not Black)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Observation) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation and the city's racial demographics, is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
