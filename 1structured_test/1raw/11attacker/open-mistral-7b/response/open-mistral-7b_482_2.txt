Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct.

The probability of being correct is the probability of the attacker being black divided by the total probability of the attacker being either black or white. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of being black and white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the total probability is 0.85 (white) + 0.15 (black) = 1.

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (given by the data in "b"). The probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (given by the data in "a").

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the attacker being black times the probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is black: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, this estimate seems to contradict the witness's identification and the error rate provided in the information. The witness identified the attacker as black, but the error rate was 20%. This means that if the attacker was actually white, the witness would be incorrect 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black should be higher than 12%.

There seems to be a contradiction in the information provided. The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, should be higher than 12%, but the information provided does not allow for a definitive calculation.

{probability: 0.12, please note that this estimate seems to contradict the information provided and may not be accurate.}
