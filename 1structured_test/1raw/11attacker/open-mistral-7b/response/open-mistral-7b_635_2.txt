To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness misidentifies race 20% of the time. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can represent the population as a vector:

[0.85, 0.15]

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of this happening when the attacker is actually black.

The probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white is 0.20. Since the population is [0.85, 0.15], the probability of selecting a black person from the population is 0.15. Multiplying these two probabilities gives us the probability of both events happening:

0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03

Now, we need to account for the fact that the witness also mistakes white people as black 20% of the time. Since the population is [0.85, 0.15], the probability of selecting a white person from the population is 0.85. Multiplying this probability by the probability of misidentification gives us the probability of mistaking a white person for black:

0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the actual attacker must be from the underrepresented group, which is black. The probability of this happening when the attacker is actually black is 1, and when the attacker is white is 0.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, which is 0.97.
