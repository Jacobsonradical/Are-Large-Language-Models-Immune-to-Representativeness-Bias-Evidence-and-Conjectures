To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability of a black attacker as P(B) and the probability of a white attacker as P(W).

Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can write the total probability as P(B) + P(W) = 1.

The witness's ability to correctly identify a black person is 80%, so we can say that P(B | witness_said_black) = 0.8.

However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time. If the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, then the actual attacker was white. Let's denote the probability of this error as P(W | witness_said_black) = 0.2.

Since the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1, we can write an equation for this case:

P(B) * 0 + P(W) * 0.2 = 0.2
P(W) = 0.2 / 0.2 = 1

This equation shows that if the witness erroneously identifies a white attacker as black, then the actual attacker has to be white. Since we know that the population is 85% white, this scenario is not plausible. Therefore, the witness must have correctly identified the attacker as black, and P(B) = 1.

However, the information provided about the witness's reliability does not allow for such a high probability. Therefore, it seems that there is a contradiction in the information provided, and the question cannot be answered with the given data.
