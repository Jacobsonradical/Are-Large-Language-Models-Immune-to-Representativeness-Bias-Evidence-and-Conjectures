To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence: the witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given the prior probability of H, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. This is given by the proportion of black people in the population, which we know is 15%. So, P(H) = 0.15.

We are also given the likelihood of E given H, which is the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black. This is given by the witness's accuracy rate, which we know is 0.8. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

We are also given the likelihood of E given not-H, which is the probability that the witness would identify a non-black person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is given by 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(E|not-H) = 0.17.

Finally, we are given the prior probability of not-H, which is the probability of the attacker not being black. This is given by the proportion of white people in the population, which we know is 0.85. So, P(not-H) = 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of H, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.147 = 0.82

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.82 or 82%.
