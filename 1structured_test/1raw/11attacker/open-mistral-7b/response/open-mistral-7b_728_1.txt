Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, which is an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's mistake, is the error rate of 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white. Therefore, {probability: 1 - 0.2, probability: 0.8} is the estimate for the probability that the attacker is black.
