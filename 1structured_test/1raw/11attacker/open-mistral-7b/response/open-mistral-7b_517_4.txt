Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% = 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given that half of the population is white and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of an attacker not being black (given in the first piece of information: 0.85)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given that half of the population is white and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1)

Bayes' theorem states that P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Substituting the values:
P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.084) â‰ˆ 0.138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 13.8%.
