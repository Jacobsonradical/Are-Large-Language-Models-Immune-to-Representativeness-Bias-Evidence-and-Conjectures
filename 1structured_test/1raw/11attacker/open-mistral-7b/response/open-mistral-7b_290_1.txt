Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population distribution, and our new evidence is the witness's observation.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's observation.

First, we need to calculate P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness would observe "black" given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate this as:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (correct identification) + 0 * (mistaken identification) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate P(A), which is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given to us as 15% or 0.15.

Then, we need to calculate P(B), which is the probability of the witness observing "black" regardless of the attacker's race. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness observing a black person is 0.15 (the probability of picking a black person). However, since the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying race, and a 20% chance of erring, the actual probability of the witness observing "black" given any person is:

P(B) = 0.15 (probability of picking a black person) * 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying) + 0.85 (probability of picking a white person) * 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying as black) = 0.12

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), which is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 87.5%. This means that, given the witness's observation and the population distribution, we would expect the attacker to be black around 87.5% of the time. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given data, and actual probabilities can vary based on a variety of factors.
