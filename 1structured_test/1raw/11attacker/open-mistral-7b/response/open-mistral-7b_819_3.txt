Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
3. If the attacker was white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black is 20%.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the actual attacker is either black or the witness made an error in identification.
5. The probability of the witness making an error while identifying a white person (P(error|white)) is 0.20.
6. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white (P(white)) is 0.85.
7. Therefore, the probability of the witness making an error while identifying the attacker (P(error)) is P(error|white) * P(white) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.
8. The probability of the attacker being black (P(black)) is then 1 - P(error) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}
