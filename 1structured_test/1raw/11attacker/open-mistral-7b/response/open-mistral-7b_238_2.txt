To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where P(H|E) is the probability we are interested in, P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

Given the information provided, we have:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black, since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making the observation given either the attacker being black or not)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
