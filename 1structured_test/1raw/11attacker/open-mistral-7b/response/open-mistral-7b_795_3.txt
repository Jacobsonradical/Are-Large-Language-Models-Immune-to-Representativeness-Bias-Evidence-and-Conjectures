To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given the witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying race, and the city's population being 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability as follows:

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is the inverse of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person. In other words, 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white, is the proportion of black people in the population, which is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness incorrectly identifies them as white is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since the witness actually identified the attacker as black, this means that the attacker is either actually black or the witness made a correct identification. The probability of the witness making a correct identification is the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them as black, and the probability that the attacker is black and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83.
