The information given consists of two parts:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness's ability to identify race, which is 80% accurate when identifying between whites and blacks, and 20% inaccurate. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Since we cannot directly observe the attacker's race, we rely on the witness's account and their accuracy rate. However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness being incorrect due to the low lighting and other conditions.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they were correct can be calculated by multiplying the witness's accuracy rate by the proportion of black people in the city:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, the attacker is likely black with a probability of 12%}

It should be noted that the witness's incorrect identifications could also indicate that the attacker was white, which would lead to an underestimation of the probability that the attacker is black. However, without more information, we cannot accurately calculate this probability.

In conclusion, based on the available data, there is a 12% probability that the attacker is black.
