To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the city has an 85% white population and a 15% black population, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification of a black person as follows:

1. The probability of the attacker being black is 15%, or 0.15.
2. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.

However, we must also consider the possibility that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black. The probability of this occurring is the product of the witness's error rate and the probability of the attacker being white:

1. The probability of the attacker being white is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, or 85%.
2. Given that the witness errs in 20% of her identifications, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that this identification was correct by subtracting the probability of the witness's error from 1:

1. The probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that it was black, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83, or 83%.
2. Since the probability of the attacker being black is 0.12, and the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that it was black, is 0.83, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, as follows: P(black | identified as black) = 0.12 * 0.83 = 0.10, or 10%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is estimated that the attacker has a 10% probability of being black. This estimate is lower than the actual 15% probability of a black attacker in the city, indicating that the witness's identification is less reliable than the actual racial composition of the city.
