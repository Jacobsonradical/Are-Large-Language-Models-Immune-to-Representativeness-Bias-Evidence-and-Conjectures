To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's define our events as follows:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following information:
- Prior probability of A (P(A)): The proportion of the population that is black, which is 15% (from information b).
- Conditional probability of B given A (P(B|A)): The witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time (from information a).
- Conditional probability of B given not-A (P(B|not-A)): The witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time (since they correctly identify half the time, so they incorrectly identify the other half).

Now, we can calculate the probability of B:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
