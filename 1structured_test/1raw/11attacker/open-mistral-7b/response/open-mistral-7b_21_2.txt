To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness makes an error when identifying the race of an individual. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Next, let's consider the racial distribution of the city's population. The attacker could be either white (with a probability of 0.85) or black (with a probability of 0.15).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness made a correct identification, and the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error, and the attacker is actually white.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness making a correct identification. This is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

The probability of the second scenario is the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error. This is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness's identification is the only information we have, we should consider both scenarios equally likely. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios. This is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person. In reality, this might not be the case, and the error rate might be different for black and white individuals. This could lead to a different probability estimate.

In summary, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%. This estimate should be interpreted with caution, as it assumes several simplifying assumptions that may not hold in reality.
