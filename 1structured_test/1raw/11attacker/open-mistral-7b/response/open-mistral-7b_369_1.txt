To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of attacker being black given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (0.8 from the given information)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we need to estimate)
- P(B) is the likelihood of the witness's identification (which we can calculate from the population statistics)

The likelihood of the witness's identification, P(B), is calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

From the given information, we know that the witness identifies correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 and P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) = 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075.

We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, P(attacker is black) = 0.15 and P(attacker is white) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.075 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.064 = 0.184

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.184 â‰ˆ 0.363

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.363 or 36.3%.
