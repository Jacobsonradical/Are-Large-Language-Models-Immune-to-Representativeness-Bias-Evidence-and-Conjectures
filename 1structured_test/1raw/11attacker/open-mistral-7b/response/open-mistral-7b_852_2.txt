Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the attacker being black and E is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time when the person is black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time when the person is not black)

We are not given the probability of the evidence P(E), but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Substituting the given values, P(E) = 0.12

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12
        â‰ˆ 0.667

So, given the witness's identification, we estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 66.7%.
