To provide an estimate, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and there is an 85% chance that the attacker is white (from information b), we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

1. The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (from information a).
2. The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (from information a, since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).
3. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.
4. The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from steps 2 and 3).
5. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
6. The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black is the sum of the probabilities from steps 4 and 5: 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29.

Based on this analysis, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29, or 29%.
