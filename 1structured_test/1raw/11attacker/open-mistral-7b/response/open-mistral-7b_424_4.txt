Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness who is typically correct 80% of the time identified the attacker as black.

However, we cannot directly use the witness's identification as evidence that the attacker is black, because there's a chance that the witness made an error. The probability of making an error is given as 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification times the actual probability of the attacker being black, plus the probability of the witness making an error times the actual probability of the attacker being white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Then, the equation becomes:

P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness's success rate)

We know that P(white) = 1 - P(black). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2 = 0.8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.8P(black) + 0.2 = 0.8

Subtracting 0.2 from both sides, we get:

0.8P(black) = 0.6

Dividing both sides by 0.8, we get:

P(black) = 0.75

So, based on the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.75 or 75%.
