To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification of a black person as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is the proportion of black people in the population multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person given their racial characteristics.
   Probability_correct_black = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

2. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white is the probability of the witness erring multiplied by the proportion of white people in the population.
   Probability_err_black = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

3. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification and erring and identifying a white person as black.
   Probability_attacker_black = Probability_correct_black + Probability_err_black
   Probability_attacker_black = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
