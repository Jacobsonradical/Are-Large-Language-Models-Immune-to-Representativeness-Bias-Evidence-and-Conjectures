To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case,
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following information:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which is a mixture of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person as black 20% of the time (from the first piece of information), P(B|not A) = 0.2.
- P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(A)

We are also given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, so P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
