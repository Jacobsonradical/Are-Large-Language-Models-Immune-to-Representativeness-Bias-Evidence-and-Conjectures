Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The reliability of the witness in identifying race, which is 80% accurate and 20% erroneous.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black increases the probability that the attacker is indeed black. However, we must also consider the possibility of the witness making an error.

Let's break it down:

- If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness would mistake him for black is 20%.
- If the attacker is black, the probability that the witness would correctly identify him as such is 80%.

Given the racial demographics, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (85%) and the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%).

We can calculate the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white and given that the attacker is black:

P(witness statement | attacker is white) = 0.20 (probability of error)
P(witness statement | attacker is black) = 0.80 (probability of correct identification)

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness's statement given the total set of possibilities. This can be done by calculating the weighted sum of the two probabilities above:

P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) + P(witness statement | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

Plugging in the values:

P(witness statement) = (0.20 * 0.85) + (0.80 * 0.15)
P(witness statement) ≈ 0.17 + 0.12
P(witness statement) ≈ 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial demographics, is approximately 0.29 (29%). This is lower than the actual proportion of black people in the city, but it's significantly higher than the probability of the witness making a mistake. This suggests that the witness's statement might be reliable, but it's still important to consider other evidence in the case.
