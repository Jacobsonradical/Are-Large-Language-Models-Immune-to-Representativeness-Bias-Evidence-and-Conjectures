Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% of the time.
2. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of a black person.

Let:
P(A) = probability of the attacker being black
P(B|A) = probability of the witness identifying a black person given that the attacker is black
P(B) = probability of the witness identifying a black person (regardless of the attacker's race)
P(A|B) = probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified a black person

From the information provided, we know:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
3. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (1 - P(B|not A)) * (1 - 0.15)
   P(B) = 0.12 + P(B|not A) * 0.85
   Since the witness's accuracy in identifying any race is not given, we cannot determine P(B|not A). However, we can assume that P(B|not A) is less than 0.8 (since the witness is more likely to correctly identify white people than black people), and we can make a rough estimate for P(B) based on this assumption.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since we cannot calculate P(B) exactly, we cannot calculate P(A|B) directly. However, we can make an approximation by assuming a value for P(B|not A). For example, if we assume that P(B|not A) = 0.7, then P(B) = 0.12 + 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.67, and P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.67 â‰ˆ 0.22 (22%).

Therefore, based on the given information and assuming a value for P(B|not A), it can be estimated that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.22 (22%). This estimate is sensitive to the assumption about P(B|not A), and a more accurate estimate would require more information about the witness's ability to identify any race.
