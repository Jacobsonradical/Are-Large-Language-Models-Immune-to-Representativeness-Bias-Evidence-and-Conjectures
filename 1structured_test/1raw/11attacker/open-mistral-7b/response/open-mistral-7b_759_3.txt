To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% in correctly identifying a person's race. However, the witness wrongly identified the attacker as black, which means they erred 20% of the time. This means that when the witness correctly identifies a person's race, they are actually identifying a person who is indeed of that race 80% of the time.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This means that the probability of a randomly chosen person being white is 0.85 and the probability of a randomly chosen person being black is 0.15.

Given that the witness's identification is unreliable and that we don't know if they correctly identified the attacker's race or not, we cannot directly use the witness's reliability to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event B).

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person. Let P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies a person as black, which is equal to the sum of P(B|A) times the probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) and P(B|not A) times the probability of the attacker not being black (P(not A)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know the values of P(B|A) (80%), P(A) (0.15), and P(B) (which we need to find).

To find P(B), we can use the formula P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). We know the values of P(B|A) and P(not A) (20%), and we can find P(A) and P(not A) from the information that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

So, P(not A) = 0.15 and P(A) = 0.85. We can then calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2925 â‰ˆ 0.272

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.272, or 27.2%. This estimate takes into account both the racial makeup of the city and the reliability of the witness's identification.
