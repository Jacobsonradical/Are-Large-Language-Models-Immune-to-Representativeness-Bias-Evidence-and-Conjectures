Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black.

From the information given, we know that P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black), and P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

The value of P(E) is a bit more complex to calculate. It represents the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of whether they are actually black or not. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the product of the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the probability of the attacker being black, and the product of the probability of the witness making an error and the probability of the attacker not being black.

Given that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is not black is 0.2 (since the probability of the attacker being white is 0.8). Therefore, P(E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.22.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.22 = 0.545

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.545 or 54.5%.
