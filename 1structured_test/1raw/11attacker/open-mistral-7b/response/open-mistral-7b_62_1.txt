Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population demographics in the city are 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's statement)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (sum of the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis)

Let's calculate the probabilities:
- P(H) = 15% (probability of a random person in the city being black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 85% (probability of a random person in the city being white)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2025

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2025 â‰ˆ 0.648

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 64.8%.
