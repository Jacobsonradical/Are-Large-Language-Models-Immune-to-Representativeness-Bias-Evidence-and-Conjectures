To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the likelihood of a random person in the city being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's identification, is 1 - the probability that the witness is correct when they identify someone as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (or 20%).

However, we know that the actual probability of a random person in the city being white is 0.85 (or 85%). Since the witness's identification is likely an error, we should adjust this probability to account for the witness's error rate.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (the error rate), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the correct rate).

Therefore, the adjusted probability of a random person in the city being white, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.68 (or 68%).

Finally, to find the probability that the attacker is black, we subtract the adjusted probability of the attacker being white from 1:

Probability that the attacker is black = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 (or 32%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.32 (or 32%).
