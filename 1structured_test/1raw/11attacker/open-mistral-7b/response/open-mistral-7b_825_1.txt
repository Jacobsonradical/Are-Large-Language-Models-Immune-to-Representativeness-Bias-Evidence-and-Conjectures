Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (correct identification) and 20% (incorrect identification).
2. The population composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Since we don't have any additional information about the witness's accuracy in identifying the attacker specifically or any biases they may have, we can only use the general statistics given.

The witness incorrectly identified a race 20% of the time. This means that, when the actual race was different from their guess, they incorrectly identified a black person as white 20% * 0.15 = 0.03 times. In other words, they incorrectly identified a black person as white only 3% of the time.

On the other hand, when the witness correctly identified a person's race, they correctly identified a black person as black 80% * 0.15 = 0.12 times.

Therefore, the total number of times the witness correctly identified a black person is the sum of these two values: 0.03 (incorrectly identifying a white person as black) + 0.12 (correctly identifying a black person as black).

The total number of times the witness made a guess about a black person is the number of black people in the sample times the number of guesses. The number of guesses is the sum of correct and incorrect guesses. So, the total number of guesses is (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 guesses per black person.

There are 100 people in the sample, so there are 15 black people, and the witness made 15 * 0.4 = 6 guesses about black people.

Therefore, the total number of correct identifications of a black person is 0.12 * 6 = 0.072.

The probability that the attacker is black is the ratio of correct identifications of a black person to the total number of guesses about black people, which is 0.072 / 0.06 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black, which means that their guess was correct. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1, as the witness's observation is the only data we have.

To reconcile this contradiction, we can assume that there is additional information or context missing from the data, which affects the validity of the witness's identification. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given data.

In conclusion, based on the given data, the probability that the attacker is black is either 1 (if we trust the witness's identification) or 0.12 (if we only rely on the witness's general accuracy). However, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. {probability: 0.12 or 1, depending on the interpretation of the data}
