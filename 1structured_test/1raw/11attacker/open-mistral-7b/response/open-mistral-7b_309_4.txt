To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying race when the attacker is black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

The probabilities we have are:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying race when the attacker is black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black, given the city's demographics)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (probability of the witness's testimony, regardless of the attacker's race)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12 = 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.75 or 75%.
