To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, times the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person as the attacker.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15.

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker given that the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy in such cases, which is 0.8 (from the second piece of information).

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker given that the attacker is white is the witness's error rate in such cases, which is 0.2 (from the second piece of information).

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker is the sum of these two probabilities, weighted by the respective prior probabilities. This can be calculated as follows:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.182 = 0.302

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is 0.302.

However, we are asked for the probability of the attacker being black, not given the witness's identification. To find this, we can use Bayes' theorem again, this time with A as the attacker being black and B as the witness not seeing the attacker's race.

The prior probability of A is 0.15, as calculated above. The probability of B given A is 1 (since the witness not seeing the race cannot affect whether the attacker is black or not). The probability of B given not-A (the attacker being white) is 0.9, since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.

The probability of B is then the sum of these two probabilities, weighted by the respective prior probabilities:

0.1 * 1 + 0.9 * 0.85 = 0.1 + 0.765 = 0.865

So, the probability of the witness not seeing the attacker's race is 0.865.

The probability of A given B is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness did not see the attacker's race. This is the same as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as the attacker given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8.

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black as follows:

0.15 * 0.8 / 0.865 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This is lower than the prior probability of 15%, because the witness's identification of a black person as the attacker is less reliable than the prior probability would suggest.
