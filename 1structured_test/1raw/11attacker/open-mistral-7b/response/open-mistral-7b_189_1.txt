To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information),
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information),
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (since the witness's error rate is given as 20%, this is equal to 0.2),
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is white given that the witness identified a black person (this is what we want to find),
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(B)),
- P(W) as the probability that the witness makes the identification they did (which is a combination of P(W|B) and P(W|~B), since the witness could have identified either a black person as black or a white person as black).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(~B|W) = P(W|~B) * P(~B) / P(W)

We know P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

We also know that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|~B) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we have P(B) = 0.15 and P(~B) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
P(~B|W) = 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives:
P(~B|W) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.18 or 18%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.
