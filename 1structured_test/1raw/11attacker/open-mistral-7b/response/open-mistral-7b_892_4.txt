To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (erring in identification). However, we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness made a correct or an incorrect identification in this specific case.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness made an unbiased identification, the probability that the attacker is black would be the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).

However, if we consider the witness's error rate, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is 0.20 (20%). This means that out of the 15% of black people in the city, the witness might have mistakenly identified 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03 (3%) as black.

Subtracting this potential error from the original 15%, we get an estimate of 0.15 - 0.03 = 0.12 (12%) as the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification.

But since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness made a correct or an incorrect identification, we cannot strictly provide a single probability between 0 and 1. Therefore, it is best to consider a range of probabilities based on the given information.
