Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts: the probability that the attacker is black in the general population, and the probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race.

1. The probability that the attacker is black in the general population is:
   {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

2. The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race is 0.2, as stated in the information.

However, the information does not provide enough detail to calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. We only know the error rate, which is 0.2. Without knowing the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, we cannot calculate the probability that the witness's identification is correct in this specific case.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. It would require additional information about the witness's accuracy in identifying black people to make such an estimation.
