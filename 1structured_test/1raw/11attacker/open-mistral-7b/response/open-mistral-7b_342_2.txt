To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white and when the attacker is black.

The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17, and the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black is 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race when the attacker is black is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race when the attacker is black divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race (both when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white) and the probabilities of the witness erring (both when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white):

probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17 + 0.03) = 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.375 or 37.5%.
