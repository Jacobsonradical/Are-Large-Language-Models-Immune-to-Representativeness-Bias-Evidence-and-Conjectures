To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any specific information about the race of the actual attacker, we can assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistakes in identifying a black person as a white person and vice versa.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. The probability that a randomly chosen person is black is therefore 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and these errors are equally likely to be mistakes in either direction, the probability that the witness's mistake was to identify a black person as white is 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness's mistake was to identify a white person as black is also 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, the probability that the actual attacker is black, given the witness's report, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness's mistake being a false identification of a white person as black.

That is, P(attacker is black) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.19 + 0.017 = 0.207.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.207 or 20.7%.
