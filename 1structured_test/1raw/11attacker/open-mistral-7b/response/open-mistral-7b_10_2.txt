To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, we can assume that their identification was correct 80% of the time, or that the actual attacker was black 80% of the time.

However, we need to account for the racial composition of the city's population. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 0.15 (or 15%).

To find the probability that a person the witness correctly identified as black is actually black, we need to multiply the witness's correct identification rate (0.8) by the actual probability of a person being black in the population (0.15).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness's identification was based on limited information and may have been influenced by bias. In this case, it's important to consider the possibility that the witness's identification may not be a reliable indicator of the attacker's race. Therefore, while the probability estimate based on the witness's identification is 12%, it should be treated as a rough estimate and subject to further investigation.

Answer: {probability: 0.12, please note that this is a rough estimate}
