Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

The prior probability P(H) can be estimated from the population demographics:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population)

The likelihood P(E|H) is given by the witness's ability to correctly identify race:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% correct identification)

The probability of the witness identifying someone as black when they are not (P(E|not H)) is given by the error rate:

P(E|not H) = 0.2 (20% incorrect identification)

The prior probability of the witness identifying someone as black, P(E), can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of them correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which can be calculated as:

P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% white population)

Now we have all the necessary components to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
