The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's demographics: P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given by the witness's ability: P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B|~A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B|~A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a white person, which is given by the witness's ability: P(B|~A) = 0.8

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can then be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the city's demographic proportion of black people, suggesting that the witness's identification may not be reliable. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis and real-world situations can be more complex.
