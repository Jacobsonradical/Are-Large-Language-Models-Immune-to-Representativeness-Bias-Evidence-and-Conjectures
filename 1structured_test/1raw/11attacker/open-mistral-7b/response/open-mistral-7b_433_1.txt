Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, and the witness's observations are independent events, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event of the attacker being black, and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given P(A) = 15% (the population is 15% black), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker is black), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race 20% of the time when the attacker is not black).

To find P(not A), we can use the fact that P(not A) + P(A) = 1, so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.204

So, given the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 20.4%.
