Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the probability before we have new evidence) with the new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

1. P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is the probability we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given in the information as 0.8 (80%).
3. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't know this, we can use the population statistics: P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
4. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the witness's error rate (1 - their success rate): P(B) = 0.2 (1 - 0.8).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2
P(A|B) = 0.6

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.6 or 60%.
