To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, which means that when the actual race is black, the witness mistakenly identifies it as white 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white:

Probability of witness misidentifying a black person as white = Probability of drawing a white person (0.85) * Witness's error rate (0.2) + Probability of drawing a black person (0.15) * 1
                                                                          = 0.17 + 0.0
                                                                          = 0.17

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is truly black is the complement of the probability of the witness's mistake:

Probability of attacker being black = 1 - Probability of witness misidentifying a black person as white
                                                      = 1 - 0.17
                                                      = 0.83

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
