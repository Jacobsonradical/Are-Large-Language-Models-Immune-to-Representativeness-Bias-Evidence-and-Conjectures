Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without any consideration of the hypothesis)

Let's break down the information:
1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% in the city. So, P(H) = 0.15
2. P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is black. From the witness's ability, we know that this probability is 0.8. So, P(E|H) = 0.8
3. P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness misidentifying them as black is 0.2. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2
4. P(H|E) is the probability we are trying to find.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(E) ≈ 0.164

Now, we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) ≈ [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.164]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.67

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
