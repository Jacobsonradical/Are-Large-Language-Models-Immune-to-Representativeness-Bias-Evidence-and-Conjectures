Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental formula in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the racial demographics of the city, and our new evidence is the witness's report.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's report.

First, let's calculate P(B|A): This is the probability of the witness reporting a black attacker given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need P(A|B): This is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness reports a black attacker. We don't have this probability directly, but we can calculate it using Bayes' theorem again with the witness's error rate. Let's call the probability of the witness reporting a white attacker when the attacker is black "q", and the probability of the witness reporting a black attacker when the attacker is white "p". Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, p + q = 0.8. However, we also know that the witness makes an error 20% of the time, so q = 0.2. Therefore, p = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6.

Now we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

We don't know the exact value of P(A), but we can substitute the values we have for P(B|A) and P(B) from the information provided. P(B) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person being white) and 1 - P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person being black). Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.12P(A) + 0.03)

However, we still don't have enough information to determine the exact value of P(A), so we cannot provide a numerical probability estimate. Instead, we can say that the probability that the attacker is black is some value between 0 and 1, which can be calculated using the above equation and the actual value of P(A).
