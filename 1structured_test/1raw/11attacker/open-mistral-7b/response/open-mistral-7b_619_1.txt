To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is equal to the error rate, which is 20%.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - the error rate, which is 80%.

Since we know that 15% of the city's population is black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of correctly identifying a black person times the proportion of black people in the population.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12 or 12%.

{probability: 0.12}
