Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's break it down:
1. The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 15%.
2. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%).
3. The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black given that the person is black is 1 (since a black person is always identified as black by a perfect observer, which we assume the witness is not).
4. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.02 (2%), and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black given that the person is white is 0 (since a white person is never identified as black by a perfect observer, which we assume the witness is not).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [(1 * 0.15)] / [((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.02 * 0.85))]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.35

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 35%.
