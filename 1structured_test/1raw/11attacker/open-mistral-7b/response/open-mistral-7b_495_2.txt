Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfectly accurate in identifying races, identified the attacker as black.

Assuming that the attack occurred randomly in the city, the probability of the attacker being black is 15% (0.15) based on the racial distribution of the city.

However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. Let's calculate the probability of this error occurring.

1. The chance of the witness erring when seeing a white person is 20%.
2. Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the witness saw a white person and erroneously identified them as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness did not identify the attacker as white, we can assume that they saw a non-white person. In this case, since 15% of the population is black, and the witness was correct 80% of the time when identifying blacks, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (12%).

Since the witness did not make an error when identifying the attacker, and they saw a non-white person, it's reasonable to conclude that they correctly identified a black person. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 12%.

However, it's important to note that this probability is an estimate based on the given information. If new information becomes available, the probability may need to be re-evaluated.
