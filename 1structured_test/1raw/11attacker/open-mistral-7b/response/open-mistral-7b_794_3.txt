Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the total probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the attacker's race)

Given the information, we can calculate:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(E | ∼H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, and since the population is 85% white, the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time as well)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ∼H) * P(∼H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.18 ≈ 0.56

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.56 or 56%.
