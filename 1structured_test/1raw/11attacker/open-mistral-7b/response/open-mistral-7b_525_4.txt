Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means the actual probability of the attacker being black is lower than the witness's error rate of 20%.

However, the question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, not the probability of the witness's error. The witness's error rate is based on a different sample and does not directly apply to this specific incident.

Given that the victim could not see the attacker's race and a witness with less than perfect accuracy identified the attacker as black, it seems reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being black is closer to the overall black population percentage in the city, which is 15%.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.15}
