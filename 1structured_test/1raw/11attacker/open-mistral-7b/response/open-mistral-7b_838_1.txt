Given the information provided, we can calculate the probabilities of the attacker being black or white and then use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is also 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2.
3. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, so the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio:

* Likelihood ratio of the witness identifying a black attacker as black: 0.8 (probability of correct identification) / 0.2 (probability of error) = 4
* Likelihood ratio of the witness identifying a white attacker as black: 0.2 (probability of error) / 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.25

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black is:

{probability: 0.183, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, given the witness's testimony and the demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.183 or 18.3%.
