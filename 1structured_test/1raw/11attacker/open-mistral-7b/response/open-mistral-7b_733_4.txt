Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not always accurate in determining race, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this could be a correct identification or an error. The probability of an error is 20%, so the probability of a correct identification is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.

Since we know that 85% of the population is white, and the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is white given the witness's statement is the probability of an error, which is 0.2 or 20%.

However, we are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Since the total probability of all possible outcomes must equal 1, and we know that the probability of the attacker being white is 0.2, the probability of the attacker being black must be 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8} or 80%.
