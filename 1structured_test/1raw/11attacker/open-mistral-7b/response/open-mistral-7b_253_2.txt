Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on two factors: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The reliability of the witness's race identification: the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we cannot use their observation as definitive evidence. Instead, we should consider the likelihood of the witness making an error in this case given the racial composition of the city.

Let's assume that the attacker is white. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case:

Probability of error = Probability of attacker being white * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying attacker as black
                                   = 0.85 * 0.2
                                   = 0.17

Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we should consider both possibilities: the witness made an error (the attacker is white) and the witness did not make an error (the attacker is black).

The probability of the witness not making an error is 1 - Probability of error = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness, is the probability of the witness not making an error:

{probability: 0.83}

However, we must consider the witness's observation. The witness identified the attacker as black. Since we cannot assume that the witness is always wrong, we should adjust our estimate to account for this observation.

Given the witness's observation, the probability of the attacker being black should be higher than our initial estimate. Since we cannot know the exact probability, the best we can do is to combine our initial estimate with the observation:

{probability: maximum of 0.83 and the probability of the witness making an error given the racial composition of the city (which is not provided in the information given)}

Without more information, we cannot determine the exact probability of the attacker being black, but we can conclude that the probability is greater than 0.83.
