Given the information provided, we can analyze the situation as follows:
1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%.
2. However, we don't have information about the witness's potential bias or error in this specific case.
3. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
4. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race, given the information, we should use the population composition as our best estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.15}
