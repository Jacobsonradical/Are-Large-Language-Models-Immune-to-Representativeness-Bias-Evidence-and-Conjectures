To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know whether the witness's mistake was misidentifying a white person as black or a black person as white.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, if the witness's mistake was more likely to be misidentifying a white person as black, then the actual probability of the attacker being black might be lower than 80%. On the other hand, if the witness's mistake was more likely to be misidentifying a black person as white, then the actual probability of the attacker being black might be higher than 80%.

Without more information about the witness's specific error patterns, we cannot make a definitive estimate. However, we can provide a range of possible estimates based on the given information.

If the witness's mistake was more likely to be misidentifying a white person as black, then the probability of the attacker being black could be lower than 80%. In this case, looking at the racial composition of the city, we can see that the probability of choosing a black person at random is 15%. If the witness's mistake rate is 20%, then the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification could be lower than 80%. This would mean that the actual probability of the attacker being black is less than 0.68 (80%).

On the other hand, if the witness's mistake was more likely to be misidentifying a black person as white, then the probability of the attacker being black could be higher than 80%. In this case, the probability of choosing a black person at random is 15%, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 20%. If we assume that the witness's mistake rate is independent of the actual race of the person, then the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification would be higher than 80%. This would mean that the actual probability of the attacker being black is greater than 0.80.

Without more information, we cannot provide a single definitive estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. However, based on the given information, we can say that the probability is likely to be between 0.68 and 1.00. {probability: between 0.68 and 1.00}
