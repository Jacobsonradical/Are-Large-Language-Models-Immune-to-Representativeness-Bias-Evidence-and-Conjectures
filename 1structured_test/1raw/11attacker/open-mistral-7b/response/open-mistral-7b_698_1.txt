Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any information about the witness's identification of the attacker in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, it could mean that they correctly identified the attacker's race or that they made an error.

Without knowing the witness's error in this specific case, we cannot provide a precise probability. However, we can make an approximate estimation based on the witness's error rate in general. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, it suggests that they are likely to be correct 80% of the time. Given that the city's population is heavily white, it's unlikely that the witness would mistake a white person for a black person unless there were strong indicators to the contrary.

Therefore, we can tentatively estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is around 80%. This is a rough estimate and should not be used in a court of law without further investigation or evidence.
