To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know the specific error rate for misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa. Let's assume that the error rate is equal for both types of errors (which is not necessarily the case, but it simplifies the calculation).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as p. Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 * p, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * p.

Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * (1 - p), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is 0.8 * (1 - p).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Mathematically, this can be written as:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p) = the witness's statement

However, we don't have enough information to solve for p directly. We can only say that the probability of the attacker being black is between 0 and 1, based on the racial composition of the city.

In the given information, the witness's statement is equal to the proportion of black people in the city (which is 0.15 or 15%). But without knowing the exact error rate for misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa, we cannot provide a more specific probability estimate.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: between 0 and 0.15, but without more information, we cannot provide a more precise number}
