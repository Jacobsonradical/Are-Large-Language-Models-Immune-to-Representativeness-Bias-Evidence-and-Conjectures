Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% probability of correctly identifying a person's race, and a 20% probability of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that they were correct, and a 0.2 probability that they made an error.

However, we don't have enough information to determine what this error means in terms of the actual race of the attacker. It could mean that the attacker is white but was mistakenly identified as black, or it could mean that a black person was misidentified as another race. Without this information, we can't accurately compute the probability that the attacker is black given the error rate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format. The information about the city's population demographics is interesting but not directly relevant to the witness's ability to identify a person's race in this specific situation.
