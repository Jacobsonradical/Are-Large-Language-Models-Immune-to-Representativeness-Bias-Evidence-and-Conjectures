To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to revise the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (Attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (Witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We know the following:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  - P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness making a mistake when the attacker is white
  - P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

However, we do not have the value of P(E|not H). To estimate it, we can use the complementary probability:

P(E|not H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.233

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.233 or 23.3%.
