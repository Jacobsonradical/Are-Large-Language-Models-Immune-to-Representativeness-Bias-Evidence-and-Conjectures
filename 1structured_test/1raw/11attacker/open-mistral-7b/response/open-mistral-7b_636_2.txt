Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black, which means they either correctly identified the attacker's race or made an error.

The probability that the witness made an error is 20%. If the attacker is white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black. Given that the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a white attacker as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since we don't have any information suggesting that the witness's error rate is different when identifying white people, we can assume that the 17% chance of an error is the same for both races. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is 100% - 17% = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
