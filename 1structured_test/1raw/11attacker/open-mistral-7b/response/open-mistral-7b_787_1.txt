Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city, with 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, with an 80% accuracy rate and a 20% error rate.

However, the second piece of information is not directly applicable to the original incident because it's based on a different sample, where the attacker's race was not known. The witness's performance is only informative about their general ability to make race judgments, not about the specific incident where they incorrectly identified the attacker as black.

Therefore, the most appropriate estimate of the attacker's race based on the available information would be to rely on the city's demographics, which suggests a 15% chance that the attacker is black.
