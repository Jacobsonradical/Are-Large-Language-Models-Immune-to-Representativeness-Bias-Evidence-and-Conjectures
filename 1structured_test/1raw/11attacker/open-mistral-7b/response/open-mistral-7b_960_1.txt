To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence, and in this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is unknown but can be estimated based on the city's demographics (given in "b"): P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Given in "a": P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Given in "a": P(B|~A) = 0.2 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.25.
- P(A|B) is what we want to find, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.25 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.222

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 22.2%.
