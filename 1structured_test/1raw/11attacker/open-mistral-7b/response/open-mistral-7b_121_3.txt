Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness could have made an error in their identification.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the witness's error rate and the city's population distribution. If we assume that the attacker is white, then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black is the error rate of 20%. On the other hand, if the attacker is black, then there is no error in the witness's identification.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that they are correct (the attacker is actually black) as follows:

Probability(Attacker is black) = Probability(Witness correctly identifies black attacker)
                                                 = 1 - Probability(Witness mistakenly identifies white attacker as black)
                                                 = 1 - 0.20
                                                 = 0.80

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 or 80%.
