Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume the attacker is either black or white. If we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement and the population statistics, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Statement, Population Statistics) = [P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Statement | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (the witness's success rate)
P(Witness Statement | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)
P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (the population percentage of blacks)
P(Attacker is White) = 0.85 (the population percentage of whites)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement and the population statistics, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability could be different in real-world situations.
