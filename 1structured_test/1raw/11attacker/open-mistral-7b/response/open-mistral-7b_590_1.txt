To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the overall racial distribution in the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

1. The overall racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black, as stated in the first piece of information.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means the witness is more likely to correctly identify a white person than a black person, given their error rate.

Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, we need to account for this error in our estimate. The likelihood that the witness made an error in this case is their error rate, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the error rate multiplied by the overall racial distribution of blacks in the city.

So, the probability {probability: 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03} that the attacker is black, considering the witness's identification and the overall racial distribution in the city. This estimate is lower than the overall racial distribution of blacks in the city, indicating that the witness's identification may be an error.
