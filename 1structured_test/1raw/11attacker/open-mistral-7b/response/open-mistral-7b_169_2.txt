Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

Let's break down the variables:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the information given, we have:
- P(H): The proportion of black people in the city. This is given as 15%. So, P(H) = 0.15
- P(E|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80%. So, P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|~H): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this is given as 0.2. However, we don't have the proportion of white people in the city who look similar to the attacker. To simplify the calculation, let's assume that white people are equally likely to be misidentified as black as black people are to be misidentified as white. This means P(E|~H) = 0.2.
- P(~H): The probability that the attacker is not black. Since P(H) = 0.15, P(~H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.376

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.376 or 37.6%.
