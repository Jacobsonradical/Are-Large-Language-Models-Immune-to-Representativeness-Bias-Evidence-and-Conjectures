To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we should weight their interpretation by the actual proportions of black and white people in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black). We can write an equation that balances the probability of being identified as black and the actual proportion of black people in the city:

P(Black) * 0.8 + P(Not Black) * 0.2 = 0.15 (since the population is 15% black)

Since the witness never identifies a white person as black, we can assume that P(Not Black) = 1 - P(Black).

Let's solve for P(Black):

P(Black) * 0.8 = 0.15
P(Black) = 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875 (or 18.75%)

However, the witness's error rate is not accounted for in this simple calculation. To account for the possibility of the witness erring and mistakenly identifying the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Black | Witness's statement) = [P(Witness's statement | Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness's statement | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness's statement | Not Black) * P(Not Black)]

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(Witness's statement | Not Black) = 0.2

But we don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness's statement | Black). To get around this, we can assume that the witness is equally likely to err when identifying either race (a conservative assumption). Then, P(Witness's statement | Black) = P(Witness's statement | Not Black) = 0.2

With this assumption, we can calculate the adjusted probability:

P(Black | Witness's statement) = [(0.2) * (0.15)] / [(0.2) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)] = 0.1176 (or 11.76%)

Therefore, given the witness's statement and the racial distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 11.76%. However, we should note that this estimate is sensitive to the assumption that the witness is equally likely to err when identifying either race. A more accurate estimate would require more information about the witness's errors when identifying black and white people separately.
