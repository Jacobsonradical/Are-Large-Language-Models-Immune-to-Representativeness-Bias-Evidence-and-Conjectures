Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply these percentages to each other to get an estimate of the attacker's race. The witness's error rate could potentially bias the estimate, but without more specific information on how that error rate applies to this situation, we can't make a definitive calculation.

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. It would require more context or additional data to make a more accurate assessment.
