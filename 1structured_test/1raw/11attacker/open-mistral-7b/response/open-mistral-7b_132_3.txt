Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated by considering the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, this information is only useful if we know the actual race of the people the witness is identifying. Since we don't have that information, we can't directly apply the witness's error rate to the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black contradicts the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's race. This creates a conflict in the information, which makes it difficult to estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on this evidence alone.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in this case. However, if we assume that the witness's statement is reliable and disregard the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's race, then the probability that the attacker is black would be 15% (the percentage of the city's population that is black). But this assumption may not reflect the true situation.
