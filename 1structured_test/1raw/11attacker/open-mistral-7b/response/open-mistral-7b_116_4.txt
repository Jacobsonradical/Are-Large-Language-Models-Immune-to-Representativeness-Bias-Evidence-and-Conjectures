Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot assume that the witness's identification is 100% accurate because they err in 20% of their racial identifications.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (the attacker is black) and multiply it by the probability that the attacker is black in the population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black). We know that P(Black) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black is P(Witness correct | Black) = 0.8 (80%).

The probability of the witness making a mistake (identifying a white person as black) is P(Witness incorrect | Not Black) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%). The probability of the attacker being white is then P(Not Black) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85%).

The probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is white is the inverse of the probability of making a correct identification when the attacker is white: P(Witness incorrect | Not Black) = 1 - P(Witness correct | Not Black) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (80%).

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (the attacker is black): P(Witness correct) = P(Witness correct | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness correct | Not Black) * P(Not Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

However, we are only interested in the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black: P(Black | Witness correct) = P(Witness correct | Black) * P(Black) / P(Witness correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.38 (38%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 38%.
