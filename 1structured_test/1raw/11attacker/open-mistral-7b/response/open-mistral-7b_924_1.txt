To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since 15% of the city's population is black, the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 0.15.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, the probability that they correctly identified the attacker as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness also identified the attacker as black, which is an event that occurs with a probability of 0.12. Since the witness is not infallible and can make mistakes, it is also possible that they made an error in this case and the attacker is actually white.

The probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since we want to find the probability that the attacker is black, we can subtract the probability that the attacker is white and the witness correctly identified it as such from the total probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race: 0.8 * 0.15 - 0.17 = 0.05 or 5%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.05 or 5%. However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual probability may be different due to various factors, such as the lighting conditions, the distance between the witness and the attacker, and the witness's overall ability to make accurate judgments about race.
