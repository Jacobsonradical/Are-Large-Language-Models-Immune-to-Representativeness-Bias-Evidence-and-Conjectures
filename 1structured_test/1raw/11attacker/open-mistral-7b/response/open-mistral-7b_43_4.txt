Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is "the attacker is black," and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15%),
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 80%),
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (1 - P(B|A) = 20%),
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(A) = 85%).

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 12%.
