Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 0.8 probability (or 80%) that the actual attacker is black, given the witness's statement.

However, we also know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. If we want to estimate the probability of the attacker being black without considering the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(WB) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black,
- P(WW) as the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black (an error),
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified a black person (the event we want to estimate),
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person, given that the attacker is black (which we know is 0.8),
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person, given that the attacker is not black (which is P(WW), since the witness can only make errors by identifying whites as blacks).

By Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

We know P(W|B) = 0.8, P(W|not B) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black), and P(not B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.165

So, if we only consider the population distribution and ignore the witness's statement, we would estimate that there is a 16.5% chance that the attacker is black.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should give more weight to their statement. Therefore, we prefer the estimate from the first part of the answer, which is P(B|W) = 0.8 or 80%. This is a higher probability, and it seems reasonable to favor it over the estimate based on the population distribution alone.

In summary, considering both the witness's statement and the city's population distribution, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 (80%).
