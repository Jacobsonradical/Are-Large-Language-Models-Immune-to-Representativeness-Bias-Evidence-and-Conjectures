To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information indicating that the witness was more likely or less likely to make an error in this particular case, we can assume that the probability of an error is 20% in all cases.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 15%. However, due to the witness's error rate, the probability that the witness identifies a black person as such is higher than 15%.

To find this probability, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(Black | Identified as Black) = P(Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black) / P(Identified as Black).

P(Identified as Black | Black) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as such. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

P(Black) is the probability of encountering a black person, which is 0.15.

P(Identified as Black) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is P(Identified as Black | Not Black) * P(Not Black) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(Identified as Black) = P(Identified as Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Identified as Black | Not Black) * P(Not Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.24.

Now we can find P(Black | Identified as Black): P(Black | Identified as Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.625.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.625 or 62.5%.
