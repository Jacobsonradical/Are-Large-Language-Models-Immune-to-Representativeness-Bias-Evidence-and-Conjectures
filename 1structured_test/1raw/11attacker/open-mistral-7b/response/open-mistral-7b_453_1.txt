The information provided includes two pieces of data: the racial distribution of the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's racial identification.

1. The racial distribution of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is incorrect.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

a) If the witness is correct, the attacker is indeed black. Since the city's population is 15% black, the probability of this scenario is 0.15.

b) If the witness is incorrect, the attacker is actually white. Given the witness's inaccuracy rate of 20%, and the fact that 85% of the population is white, the probability of this scenario is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we cannot know which scenario is correct, we should add the probabilities of both scenarios to get an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is black:

0.15 (witness is correct) + 0.17 (witness is incorrect) = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32 (or 32%).
