Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black doesn't necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There's a chance that the witness made an error.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness's mistake:

- The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20% (from information b).
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 80% (from information b).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability of the witness's correct identification. To find this, we subtract the probability of the witness's mistake (when the attacker is actually white) from 1:

1 - 0.20 = 0.80

However, we need to account for the fact that the city has a higher proportion of white people than black. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's race, then we can use the city's demographics to adjust our probability.

The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (from information a), and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker is 0.80 (from the calculation above), and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black attacker as white is 0.20 (from information b).

The probability of the witness's correct identification when the attacker is white is 0.80, and the probability of the witness's mistake when the attacker is black is 0.20.

The total probability of the witness's correct identification is the weighted sum of these two probabilities:

0.85 * 0.80 + 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.71. This means there's a 71% chance that the attacker is black, and a 29% chance that the attacker is white.
