To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have information about whether they tend to misidentify whites as blacks more often or vice versa. Let's assume for now that they make errors randomly, meaning the error rate of misidentifying a white person as black is the same as misidentifying a black person as white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random encounter being with a white person is 0.85, and with a black person is 0.15.

Since the witness's errors are random, we can calculate the probability of their identifying a black person as white (an error) as the same probability as them identifying a white person as black (another error).

The probability of an error can be calculated as the error rate times the probability of a random encounter:

Probability of error = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Since the witness correctly identifies people 80% of the time, the probability of their correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.80.

However, we don't know the total number of encounters the witness had, so we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification. We can only make an estimate.

Given the witness's 80% accuracy and the racial distribution of the city, it's likely that the attacker is black. However, without more information, we cannot provide a precise probability.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the provided information, is not straightforward to calculate and would require additional information.
