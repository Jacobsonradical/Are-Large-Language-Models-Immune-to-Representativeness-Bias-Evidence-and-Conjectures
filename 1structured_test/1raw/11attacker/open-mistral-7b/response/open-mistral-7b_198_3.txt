Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%).

2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

3. However, since the witness cannot see the attacker's face and the attack happened at night, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the racial demographics of the city. We can only assume that the witness's ability to identify race may be less reliable in such a situation.

4. Therefore, it would be unfair and an overestimation to assume that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate), given that the witness's ability to judge race under these conditions is not certain.

5. On the other hand, it would also be an underestimation to assume that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.15 (the racial demographic of the city), given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

6. A more reasonable estimate would be to consider the witness's error rate in situations like this. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is less reliable in the dark, we could potentially increase the error rate. Let's say the error rate increases to 30% (a conservative estimate).

7. In this case, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black would be 0.3 (30%), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person would be 0.7 (70%).

8. However, without more specific information on how the witness's error rate might increase in such situations, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the available information, is an estimate and can only be approximated. A possible estimate could be around 0.7 (70%), but this should be considered as a rough estimate and not as a definitive probability. {probability: 0.7}
