Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness is making an unbiased mistake, then the probability of them mistakenly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white would be equal to the probability of them mistakenly identifying the attacker as white when the attacker is actually black.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness's mistake is assumed to be unbiased, this means that the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is also 0.17.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that they either correctly identified a black person or they made a mistake by incorrectly identifying a white person as black. The probability of the first event is 0.15, and the probability of the second event is 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

So, {probability: 0.32} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
