To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is the same as the probability of mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85 and the probability of being black is 0.15.

The error rate for the witness is 0.2, or 20%. To find the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a black person as white, we can multiply the probability of a black person being chosen by the error rate:

0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 3% of the time.

Now, let's find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black:

0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 12% of the time when the actual attacker is black.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we know that the witness did not make an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black:
