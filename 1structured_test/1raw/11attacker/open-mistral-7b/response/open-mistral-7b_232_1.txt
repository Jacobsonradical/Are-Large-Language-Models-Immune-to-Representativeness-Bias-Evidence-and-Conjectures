Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to accurately identify race. In this case, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black. But we cannot be certain that the witness was correct, given the error rate of 20%.
4. Therefore, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and identified the attacker as black when they were actually white.
5. To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that 85% of the population is white.
6. This probability is equivalent to the probability of drawing a white person from the population and having the witness incorrectly identify them as black.
7. Since the witness errs in 20% of their identifications, the probability of erring when identifying a white person is 0.20.
8. The probability of drawing a white person is 0.85.
9. Therefore, the probability of both events occurring (drawing a white person and erring in the identification) is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).
10. Subtracting this probability from 100% gives us the probability that the witness was correct and the attacker is actually black.
11. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 100% - 17% = 83%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83} (or 83%).
