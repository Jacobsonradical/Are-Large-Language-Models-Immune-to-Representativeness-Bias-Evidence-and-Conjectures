Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness's identification is correct in this case.

We do know the racial demographics of the city, with 85% being white and 15% being black. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and unbiased, we could use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem that describes the update of a probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, P(H|E) is what we're trying to find, which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black if that person is actually black. From the information given, this is 0.8 (80%).

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 15% in the information.

P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. To calculate this, we need to consider both when the person is actually black and when the person is actually white.

The witness correctly identifies someone as black 80% of the time when they are actually black. So, in 80% of the cases where the attacker is black, the witness correctly identifies them as black.

The witness incorrectly identifies someone as black 20% of the time when they are actually white. So, in 20% of the cases where the attacker is white, the witness incorrectly identifies them as black.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. So, in 85% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies someone as white if they are actually white.

However, in the 15% of the cases where the attacker is black, the witness incorrectly identifies them as white. So, in 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 of the cases, the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white.

Since there are 100% of cases in total, we can now calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.85 * 0.8) + (0.03 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 + 0.027 = 0.827

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.827 â‰ˆ 0.162

So, based on the witness's identification and assuming the witness's error rate is random and unbiased, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 16.2%.
