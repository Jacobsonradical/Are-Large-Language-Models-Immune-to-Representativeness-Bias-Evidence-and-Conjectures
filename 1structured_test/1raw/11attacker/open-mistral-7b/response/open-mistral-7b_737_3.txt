Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's description of the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (which is the city's black population proportion), and let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (which is the witness's accuracy rate). Let P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which is the witness's error rate).

We are given that P(A) = 0.15 (the city's black population proportion), P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|~A) = 0.2. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness described the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Computing this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.37

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 37%.
