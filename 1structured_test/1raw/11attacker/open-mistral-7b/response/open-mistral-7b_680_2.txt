To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case,
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given three pieces of information:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (probability of the witness identifying any person as black)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
          = 0.625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.625 or 62.5%.
