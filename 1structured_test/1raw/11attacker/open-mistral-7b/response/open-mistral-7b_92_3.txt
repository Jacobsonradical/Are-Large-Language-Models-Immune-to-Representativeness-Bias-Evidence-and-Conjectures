To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Here, P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's reliability in identifying race, which we know is 0.8.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is our initial belief before considering the witness's testimony, which we want to estimate.

P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is the error probability of the witness when identifying race, which we know is 0.2.

P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(H).

Using these values, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * P(H)] / [0.8 * P(H) + 0 * P(~H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8P(H) / [0.8P(H) + 0.2(1-P(H))]

We don't have a direct value for P(H), but we do have information about the city's population: 85% white and 15% black. This means that P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black) and P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white).

Substituting these values into the equation above, we can solve for P(H|E):

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3

So, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3, or 30%.
