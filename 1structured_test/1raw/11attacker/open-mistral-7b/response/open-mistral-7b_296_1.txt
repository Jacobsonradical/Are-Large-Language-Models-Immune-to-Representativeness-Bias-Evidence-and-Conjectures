Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we should consider this a false positive. The probability of a false positive in this case is 20%.

However, we also know the racial distribution in the city. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This gives us the actual probability of the attacker being black, which is 15%.

Now, we need to account for the witness's error. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this means the actual attacker was likely white. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a white individual being mistakenly identified as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness's error rate is higher for white individuals, it's more likely that the attacker was mistakenly identified as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, considering the witness's error, would be lower than 15%.

However, without more specific information about how the witness's error rate applies to this specific situation, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate. So, I would suggest a conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, to be less than 15%.

{probability: less than 0.15, please interpret this as a conservative estimate}
