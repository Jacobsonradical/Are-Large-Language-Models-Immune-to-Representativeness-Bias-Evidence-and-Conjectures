To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we first need to understand the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information about whether the witness's error was mistaking a black person for white or vice versa, we will assume an equal error rate for simplicity (this assumption might overestimate the probability of the attacker being black if the witness tends to misidentify black people as white more often than the other way around).

Given this equal error rate assumption, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black by multiplying the overall probability of a black person being present by the witness's correct identification rate for black people:

Probability of witness identifying black person as black = Probability of black person * Witness's correct rate for black people
                                                                            = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                            = 0.12

Now, since the witness incorrectly identified someone as black, we need to account for this by subtracting the above probability from 1:

Probability of attacker being black = 1 - Probability of witness identifying black person as black
                                                      = 1 - 0.12
                                                      = 0.88

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.88 or 88%.
