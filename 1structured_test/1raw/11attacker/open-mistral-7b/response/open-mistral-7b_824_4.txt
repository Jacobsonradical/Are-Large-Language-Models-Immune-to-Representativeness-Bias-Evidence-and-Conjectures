To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we have:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, and 15% is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (The probability of the witness making this mistake, given that the attacker is not black)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This means that, given the witness's testimony and the information we have about the population and the witness's reliability, we believe that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different.
