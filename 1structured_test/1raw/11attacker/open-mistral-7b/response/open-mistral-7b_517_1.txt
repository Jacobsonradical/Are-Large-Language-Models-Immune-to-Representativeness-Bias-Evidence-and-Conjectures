To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- Q(W) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white
- P(W') as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white
- Q(W') as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black

From the information given, we know that:
1. P(W) + Q(W) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying race)
2. P(W') + Q(W') = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying race)
3. P(B) + P(W) = 1 (total probability of attacker being black or white)
4. P(W') + P(B) = 0.85 (total probability of witness correctly identifying attacker)

We can simplify equation 4 by substituting P(W') from equation 2:
P(W') + P(B) = 0.85 => P(B) = 0.85 - 0.2 * P(W')

Now, we need to find a relationship between P(W'), P(W), and Q(W). Since P(W') + Q(W') = 0.2, and we know that Q(W) = 1 - P(W), we can write:
P(W') + (1 - P(W)) = 0.2

Let's rearrange the equation above to solve for P(W'):
P(W') = 0.2 - (1 - P(W))

Now, we can substitute P(W') from the above equation into P(B) = 0.85 - 0.2 * P(W'):
P(B) = 0.85 - 0.2 * (0.2 - (1 - P(W)))

Simplifying the equation, we get:
P(B) = 0.85 - 0.04 * (2 - P(W))

Given that P(W) = 0.8, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:
P(B) = 0.85 - 0.04 * (2 - 0.8)
P(B) = 0.85 - 0.04 * 0.2
P(B) â‰ˆ 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
