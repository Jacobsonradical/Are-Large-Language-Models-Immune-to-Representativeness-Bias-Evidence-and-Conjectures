Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's judgement is independent of the actual race of the attacker (which may not be the case, but let's assume it for simplicity), then we can model this as a binomial probability distribution.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (p) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker (q) is 0.2.

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's errors, then the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker, given that they said the attacker was black, is p = 0.8.

The probability of a false positive (witness saying attacker is black when attacker is white) is q * P(white) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, where P(white) is the probability of a random person being white.

The probability of a true positive (witness saying attacker is black when attacker is black) is p * P(black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The total number of possible outcomes is 2 (black or white attacker) * 2 (witness correctly identifies or errs).

The likelihood ratio of the hypothesis that the attacker is black to the hypothesis that the attacker is white is the ratio of the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker is black to the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker is white: LR = P(witness says black | attacker is black) / P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.12 / 0.17 ≈ 0.706.

Since the witness's statement increases the probability of the attacker being black by a factor of LR, the posterior probability of the attacker being black is the prior probability of the attacker being black multiplied by LR:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.706 ≈ 0.106, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.106 or 10.6%.
