To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness identifies races correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the race of the attacker was actually white, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as black. Conversely, if the attacker was black, there would be an 80% chance that the witness would correctly identify the attacker's race.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification:

1. Probability of the attacker being black and correctly identified: 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) = 0.12
2. Probability of the attacker being white and mistakenly identified as black: 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, considering both the correct identification and mistaken identification, is the sum of the two probabilities calculated above: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
