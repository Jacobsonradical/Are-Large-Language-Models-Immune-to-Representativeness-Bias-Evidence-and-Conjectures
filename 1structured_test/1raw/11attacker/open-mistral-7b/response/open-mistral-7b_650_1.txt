Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event with two possible outcomes (black or white), and the witness's judgement is also a random event with two possible outcomes (correct or incorrect), we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black.

From the information provided, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(~B|A) = 0.2. We also know that the total probability of the witness making a correct identification is P(B|A) + P(B|~A) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can infer that the prior probability of the attacker being black is P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
       = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
