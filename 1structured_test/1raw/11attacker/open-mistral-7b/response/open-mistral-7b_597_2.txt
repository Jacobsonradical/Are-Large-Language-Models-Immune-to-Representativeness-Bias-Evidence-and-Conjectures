To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Here's how we can apply Bayes' theorem:

1. Let H be the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
2. Let E be the evidence, which is the witness's identification.
3. We are given P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population).
4. We are also given P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
5. We are given P(H|E) = ? (the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification).
6. We are given P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black).
7. We are given P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is not black, based on the city's population).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.28, or 28%.
