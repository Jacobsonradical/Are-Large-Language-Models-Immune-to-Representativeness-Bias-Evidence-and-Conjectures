Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means they erred in this instance. However, we do not know if this error was one of the 20% of incorrect identifications the witness makes or if it was an outlier.

Given that we do not have enough information to adjust for the witness's error rate, we can only base our estimate on the racial composition of the city. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15%, which is the percentage of the city's population that is black.

{probability: 0.15}
