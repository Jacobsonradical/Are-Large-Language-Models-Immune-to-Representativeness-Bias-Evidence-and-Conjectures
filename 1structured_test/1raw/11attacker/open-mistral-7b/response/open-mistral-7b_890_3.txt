Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:
1. The racial distribution of the city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and mistakenly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's reliability.

First, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is white, given the city's racial distribution:
P(white) = 0.85 (probability of drawing a white person from the city's population)

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black:
P(witness mistakes white as black) = 0.2 (given in the information)

Next, we'll calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black:
P(witness correctly identifies black) = 1 - P(witness mistakes white as black) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is actually white:
P(witness identifies white as black | attacker is white) = P(witness mistakes white as black) = 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write the following equation:
P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black and attacker is black) + P(witness identifies white as black and attacker is white)

We know P(witness correctly identifies black) = 0.8, P(witness mistakes white as black) = 0.2, and P(white) = 0.85. So, we can calculate the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is white:
P(witness identifies white as black and attacker is white) = P(witness mistakes white as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) = 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is black:
P(witness correctly identifies black and attacker is black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black) = P(attacker is black) * 0.8

Substituting the known values in the above equation, we get:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black and attacker is black) + P(witness identifies white as black and attacker is white)
= P(attacker is black) * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.17

To find the value of P(attacker is black), we need to solve this equation for P(attacker is black):
0.8 * P(attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.17
P(attacker is black) = 0.64 + 0.17 / 0.8
P(attacker is black) â‰ˆ 0.825

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.825 or 82.5%.
