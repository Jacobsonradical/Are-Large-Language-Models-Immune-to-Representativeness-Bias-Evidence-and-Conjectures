Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- θ: The true population proportion of blacks in the city
- E: The witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:
1) P(H) = θ, the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that we know the population composition. As you mentioned, 85% of the city's population is white, so the proportion of blacks is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

2) P(E | H) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.

3) P(E | ~H) = 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / [P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the numbers, we calculate:

P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(H | E) ≈ 0.218

So, based on the witness's identification, our estimated probability that the attacker is black is 21.8%.
