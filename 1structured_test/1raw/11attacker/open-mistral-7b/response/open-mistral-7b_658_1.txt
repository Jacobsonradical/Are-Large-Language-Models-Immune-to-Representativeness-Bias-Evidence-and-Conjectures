Given the information provided, it's important to note that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is not necessarily indicative of the actual racial composition of the attacker, as the witness's error rate was not specified in terms of race. However, we can use the witness's overall accuracy rate to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is evenly distributed across the two races (which is not necessarily the case, but we're making this assumption for simplicity), then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is equal to the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%.

However, the witness also made errors 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black is 20%.

The total probability of the witness's identification being correct (either because the witness correctly identified a black person as black or because the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black) is the sum of these two probabilities.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.25, which is approximately 25%}

This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is evenly distributed across the two races, which may not be the case in reality. A more accurate estimate would require additional information about the witness's error rate for each race.
