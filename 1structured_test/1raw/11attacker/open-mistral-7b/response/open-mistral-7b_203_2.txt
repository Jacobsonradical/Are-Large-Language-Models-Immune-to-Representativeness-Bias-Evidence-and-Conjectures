To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

First, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the given information)

Then, let's calculate P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black:

P(B|~A) = 0.2 (from the given information, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being black:

P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information, since 15% of the population is black)

And finally, let's calculate P(~A), the prior probability of the attacker being non-black:

P(~A) = 0.85 (from the given information, since 85% of the population is non-black)

Now we can calculate P(B), the total probability of the witness identifying any person as black:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
