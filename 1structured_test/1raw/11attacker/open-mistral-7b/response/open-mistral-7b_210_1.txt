Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can use the witness's error rate as an estimate of the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is incorrect.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can infer that the probability of a random person in the city being black is 0.15. This means that if the attacker is white, the witness is likely to err and identify the attacker as black 20% of the time.

However, if the attacker is actually black, the witness will correctly identify their race 80% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness is correct or not, we can't simply multiply the probability of the attacker being black (0.15) by the witness's correct identification rate (0.8).

Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, P(A|B) is what we want to find (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black). We are given P(B|A) (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15), and P(B) (the probability of the witness identifying any person as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of them correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person).

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time and there are more white people than black, it is likely that most of the time when the witness identifies a person as black, they are actually correct. Therefore, P(B) is closer to P(B|A) than to P(B|not A).

However, without more specific information, it is impossible to calculate P(B) exactly. As a rough estimate, we could assume that P(B) is somewhere between P(B|A) and P(B|not A). Since P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a random person as black, which is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (given that 0.2 of the time the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black), we can say that P(B) is probably greater than 0.03 but less than 0.8.

Given this uncertainty, it is not possible to provide a strict numerical estimate for P(A|B). However, we can say that the probability that the attacker is black is likely to be greater than 0.15 (the prior probability) but less than 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person).
