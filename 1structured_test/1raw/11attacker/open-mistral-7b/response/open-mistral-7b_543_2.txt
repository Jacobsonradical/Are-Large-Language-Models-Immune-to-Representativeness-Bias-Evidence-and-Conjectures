To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time and correctly identifies race 80% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white, and an 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

Given the racial composition of the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the proportion of black people in the city, plus the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black times the proportion of white people in the city.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. Then, we can write the equation as:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Using these values, we can calculate the probability:

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(B) = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29.
