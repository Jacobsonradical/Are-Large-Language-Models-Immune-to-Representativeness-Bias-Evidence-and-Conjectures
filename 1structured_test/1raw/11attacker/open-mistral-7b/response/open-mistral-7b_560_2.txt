Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(B|A) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(B|~A) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (from information a)
- P(~A) = probability of the attacker not being black = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from information b)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement is approximately 0.45 or 45%.
