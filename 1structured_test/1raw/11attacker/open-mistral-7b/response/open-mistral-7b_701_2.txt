To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's description of the attacker as black

The probability of the witness's description given the attacker being black is given as 0.8 in the information provided. This is denoted as P(E|H).

The prior probability of the attacker being black, before considering the witness's description, is given as 0.15 (85% white, 15% black) in the information provided. This is denoted as P(H).

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

To find P(E), the probability of the witness's description, we can use the law of total probability. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Since we don't have information about P(E|not H), we can't find the exact value of P(E). However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is the same for black and white people, which means P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since P(E|H) = 0.8).

With this assumption, we can approximate P(E) as 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24

Now, we can estimate P(H|E) as 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.625 or 62.5%.
