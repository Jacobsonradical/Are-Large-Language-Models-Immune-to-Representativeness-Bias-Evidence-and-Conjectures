To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people), and P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black). We are also given that the population is 85% white, so P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness's accuracy in identifying non-black people).

However, we do not have enough information to directly calculate P(E). So, we will assume that the witness is equally likely to make a mistake in identifying black people as non-black people, which means P(E|~H) = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
