Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect; they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.
4. Without knowing the specific error rate of the witness in this particular situation (which is not provided), we cannot calculate the exact probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification.

So, strictly answering the question in the requested format, we cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's overall accuracy rate. If we assume that the witness's error rate in this situation is similar to their overall error rate, then the probability that they incorrectly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker is actually white) is 20%. Therefore, the probability that they correctly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker is actually black) would be 1 - 20% = 80%.

Given that 15% of the population is black, if we assume that the witness's error rate in this situation is similar to their overall error rate, then the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (80%) times the probability of the attacker being black in the population (15%).

So, our estimate would be: {probability: 0.12, where 0.12 represents an estimated 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided.}

Again, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the witness's error rate in this situation is similar to their overall error rate. If the witness's error rate in this situation is significantly different from their overall error rate, then our estimate would be less accurate.
