Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's description of the attacker as black

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E) is the probability of the witness describing the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(not H) = 0.85 (since P(H) + P(not H) = 1)

Now we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
