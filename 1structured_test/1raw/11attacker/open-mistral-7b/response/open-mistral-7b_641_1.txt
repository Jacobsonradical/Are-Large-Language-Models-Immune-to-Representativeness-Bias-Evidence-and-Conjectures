Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race, and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the actual probability that the attacker is black is the inverse of the error probability.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
