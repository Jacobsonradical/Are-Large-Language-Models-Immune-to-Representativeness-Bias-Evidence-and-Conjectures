To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and 85% of the city's population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Let W be the probability of a random person being white, and B be the probability of a random person being black. Since W + B = 1 (given that 85% of the population is white), then W = 0.85 and B = 0.15.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is the product of W and the witness's error rate, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - the probability of the witness making an error, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.8.
