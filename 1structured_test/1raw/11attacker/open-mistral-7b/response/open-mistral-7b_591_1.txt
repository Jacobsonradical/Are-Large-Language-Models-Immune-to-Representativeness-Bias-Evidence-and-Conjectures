Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also have a witness account that the attacker was identified as black. The witness has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying race, but errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness was correct in their identification is the witness's accuracy rate. So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.8}
