Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume the attacker's race is either black or white. We know that the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. This means that when the attacker is actually black, the witness will incorrectly identify them as white 20% of the time. Similarly, when the attacker is actually white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, plus the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time, we can write the following equation:
P(black) = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white)

Since the total probability of the attacker being either black or white is 1, we can write another equation:
P(black) + P(white) = 1

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for P(black):

P(black) = (1 - 0.2 * P(white)) / 0.8

We know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. This means that the probability of a random person being white is 0.85 and the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(black) = (1 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8
P(black) = 0.2 / 0.8
P(black) = 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.25 or 25%.
