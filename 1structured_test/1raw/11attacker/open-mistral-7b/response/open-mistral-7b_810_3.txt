Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A given the evidence B.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (given in the first piece of information). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (given in the second piece of information).

However, we also know that the witness errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that there is a 0.2 probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Therefore, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 0.2.

The probability of the witness identifying a black person given that they are black is therefore 0.8. The probability of the witness identifying a white person given that they are white is 0.2.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person given that they identified a black person is the error rate, which is 0.2. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a black person given that they identified a black person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
        â‰ˆ 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12, or 12%.
