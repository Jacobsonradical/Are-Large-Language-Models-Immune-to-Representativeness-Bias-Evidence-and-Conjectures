To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black as P(err).

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can express this as P(correct) + P(err) = 1, so P(err) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as P(black|correct). Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can say that P(black|correct) = 0.8.

Similarly, let's denote the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black as P(white|err). Given that the witness errs 20% of the time and does so by incorrectly identifying a white person as black, we can say that P(white|err) = 0.5.

Since the witness's observations are independent of the population's racial composition, we can assume that P(black|correct) = P(black), and P(white|err) = P(white).

Now we have two equations:

1) P(black) + P(white) = 1 (population composition)
2) P(black|correct) * P(correct) + P(white|err) * P(err) = P(attacker is identified as black)

We know the values of P(err) and P(correct) from the witness's reliability, and we know the values of P(white|err) and P(white) from the population composition. We can substitute these values into Equation 2 to get:

P(black) * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = P(attacker is identified as black)

However, we don't have the value of P(attacker is identified as black) in this problem statement. Since the attacker's race is unknown, the witness could have identified any race, and thus, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is 1. Therefore, the right side of Equation 2 becomes 1.

Now we can solve for P(black):

P(black) * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 1
P(black) = 0.625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.625 or 62.5%.
