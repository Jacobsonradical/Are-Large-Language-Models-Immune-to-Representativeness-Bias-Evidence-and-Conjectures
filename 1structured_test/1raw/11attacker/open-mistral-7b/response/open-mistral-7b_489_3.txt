Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't have exact data for, but we can estimate using the city's population statistics)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the witness's statement (that the attacker is black)
- P(A|B) is the probability we're trying to find, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black

The witness's statement has a 20% error rate, so P(B|not A) is also 20%. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, given the city's population statistics, can be estimated as:
P(A) = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
          = 0.12

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate relies on the assumption that the attacker's race is a random event, which may not be the case. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors.
