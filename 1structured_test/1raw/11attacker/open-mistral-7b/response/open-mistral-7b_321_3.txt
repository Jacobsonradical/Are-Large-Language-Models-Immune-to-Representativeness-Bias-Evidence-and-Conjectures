Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, we don't know whether the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of identifying people as black or white.

Without this information, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, or vice versa, based on the witness's identification. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate between 0 and 1.

However, if we assume that the witness's errors are random and do not favor one race over the other, we could use Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability estimate. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief might be that the attacker is equally likely to be black or white, given the city's demographics.

But as mentioned earlier, without knowing the witness's error distribution, we cannot perform this calculation accurately. Therefore, I would advise against making any strong probability estimates based on the given information.
