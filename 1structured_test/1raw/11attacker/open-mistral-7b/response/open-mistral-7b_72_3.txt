To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the information given and make an inference based on the reliability of the witness's race identification.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not a random event, but rather a result of the witness's ability to judge race.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have enough information to distinguish between correct and incorrect identifications in this specific case, we will assume that each identification (correct or incorrect) has an equal chance of being the attacker.

So, the probability of the witness identifying a black person (correctly or incorrectly) as the attacker is 0.8 (the proportion of correct identifications). This means that out of the total number of times the witness identifies a person as black, 0.8 of those identifications are likely to be the actual attacker (if the attacker was black).

However, since we know that 85% of the population is white, there is a high likelihood that the attacker is white. Therefore, even if the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, it's still more likely that the attacker is white.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black, and then multiply it by the probability of the attacker being black in the first place.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct (given that the attacker is black) is 0.8 (the proportion of correct identifications) * 0.15 (the probability of a random person being black).

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race. Given that the witness has a higher error rate for identifying whites as blacks (20% error rate) than for identifying blacks as blacks (10% error rate), it's possible that the witness's identification is not independent of the attacker's race.

In this case, the probability of the witness's identification being correct (given that the attacker is black) may be lower than 0.8 * 0.15. Without more information, it's difficult to provide a precise estimate for this probability.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. However, given the high proportion of white people in the population, it's reasonable to conclude that the probability is less than 0.15 (15%), but more than 0 (0%).
