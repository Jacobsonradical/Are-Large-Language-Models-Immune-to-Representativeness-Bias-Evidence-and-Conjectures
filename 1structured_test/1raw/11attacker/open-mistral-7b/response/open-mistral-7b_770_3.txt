To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the given information, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of a person being black in the city)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of a person being white in the city)

Bayes' theorem states that: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.241, or 24.1%.

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24.1%.
