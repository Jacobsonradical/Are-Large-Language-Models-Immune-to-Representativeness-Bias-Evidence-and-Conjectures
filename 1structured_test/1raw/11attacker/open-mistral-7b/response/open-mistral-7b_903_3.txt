To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. Since we don't have any information suggesting that the witness is more likely to misidentify black people, we can assume that the error rate is 20% for both races.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black by multiplying the base probability of a black person being present by the witness's correct identification rate for black people:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(black person) * P(witness correctly identifies black person)
                                                                     = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                     = 0.12

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is P(witness incorrectly identifies black person) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of a white person being present is 0.85.

So the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black and attributing it to the attacker is:

P(witness misidentifies white person as black | attacker is white) = P(white person) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black person)
                                                                                         = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                                         = 0.17

The overall probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, is then:

P(attacker is white | witness identification) = 1 - P(attacker is black | witness identification)
                                                                 = 1 - 0.12
                                                                 = 0.88

Now, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made a correct identification of a white person, misleading us into thinking that the attacker is white. The probability of this happening is:

P(witness correctly identifies white person) = P(white person) * P(witness correctly identifies black person)
                                                                     = 0.85 * 0.8
                                                                     = 0.68

Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person as black with a probability of 0.2, the overall probability that the witness's identification of a white person is incorrect is:

P(witness misidentifies white person as black | attacker is white) = P(white person) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black person)
                                                                                         = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                                         = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is white, taking into account both the witness's correct identification of a white person and the misidentification:

P(attacker is white | witness's identification and correct identification) = P(witness correctly identifies white person) / (P(witness correctly identifies white person) + P(witness misidentifies white person as black | attacker is white))
                                                                                                      = 0.68 / (0.68 + 0.17)
                                                                                                      = 0.68 / 0.85
                                                                                                      â‰ˆ 0.8

Since the first calculation of P(attacker is black | witness identification) is more reliable, we can use that value as our final estimate.
