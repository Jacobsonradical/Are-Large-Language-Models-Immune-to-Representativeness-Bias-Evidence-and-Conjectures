Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. Since we don't have any information about the attacker being identified correctly or incorrectly in this specific case, we can assume that the attacker's race being black is an "event" that occurs with a probability of 0.8 (80%) according to the witness.

However, we also have the demographic information that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This is more objective information about the racial distribution in the city. Therefore, we can also consider this as the true probability of an attacker being black.

In an ideal world, we would combine these two pieces of information to get a more accurate estimate. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to do that accurately. The witness's ability to identify race is not necessarily representative of the actual racial distribution in the city. Therefore, as a best guess, I would lean towards the more objective demographic information and estimate the probability of the attacker being black to be 0.15 (15%).

However, it's important to note that this is a simplified interpretation and in a real-world court case, more complex statistics and considerations would likely be used.
