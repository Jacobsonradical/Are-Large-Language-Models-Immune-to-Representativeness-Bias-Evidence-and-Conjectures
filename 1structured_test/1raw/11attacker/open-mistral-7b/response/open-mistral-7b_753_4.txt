Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- E: event of the attacker being black
- W: event of the witness identifying the attacker as black
- B: event of the population being black (given by the statistics)

From the statement b, we know P(W|E) = 0.8 and P(W|not E) = 0.2. From statement a, we know P(E) = 0.15 and P(not E) = 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states that P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

We can find P(W) as follows:
P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(E|W):
P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4828 or 48.28%.
