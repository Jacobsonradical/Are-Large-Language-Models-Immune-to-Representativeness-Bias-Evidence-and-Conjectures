Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The reliability of the witness in identifying race: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as we do not know if the witness made a correct identification or an error.

To estimate the probability, we need to consider both the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's reliability. Here's how we can do this:

1. Since we don't know if the witness made a correct identification or an error, we can assume an equal likelihood of both possibilities. This means we should consider both the true probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's population distribution) and the probability of the witness falsely identifying the attacker as black (given by the witness's reliability).
2. The probability of the attacker being black is 15% (0.15).
3. The probability of the witness falsely identifying a white person as black is 20% (0.2), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 80% (0.8).
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the two probabilities we need to consider are the probability of the attacker being black (0.15) and the probability of the witness falsely identifying a white person as black (0.2).
5. To find the overall probability of the witness making a correct identification, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) / [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness identification | Attacker is not black) * P(Attacker is not black)]
6. Since we know that P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time) and P(Attacker is black) = 0.15, we can find P(Witness identification | Attacker is not black) as P(Witness identification | Attacker is not black) = P(Witness falsely identifying a white person as black) = 0.2
7. Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.201 = 0.597

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.597 or 59.7%.
