To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial composition of the city's population.

From the information provided, we know that:
1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, given that the witness has a 20% error rate, there's a chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. To account for this error, we need to calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(Correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race
- P(Error) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race

From the information provided, we know that:
P(Correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(B) + P(W) = 1 (the attacker is either black or white)

We also know that:
P(Correct) * P(B) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person
P(Correct) * P(W) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we have:
P(Correct) * P(B) = 1 (the witness correctly identified the attacker)

Now we want to find P(B), which is the probability that the attacker is black. We can rewrite the equation for P(B) in terms of P(Correct) and the racial composition of the city:

P(B) = 1 / (P(Correct) * P(B) + P(Correct) * P(W))

We know P(Correct) = 0.8, and P(W) = 1 - P(B) (given that P(B) + P(W) = 1).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B):

P(B) = 1 / (0.8 * P(B) + 0.8 * (1 - P(B)))

Solving this equation for P(B) gives us:

P(B) = 0.54 (or 54%)

Thus, based on the witness's ability to identify races and the racial composition of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.54 (54%).
