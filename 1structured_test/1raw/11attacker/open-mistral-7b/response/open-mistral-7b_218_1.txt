To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race)

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
