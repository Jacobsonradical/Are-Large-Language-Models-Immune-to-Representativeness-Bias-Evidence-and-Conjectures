Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, our hypothesis H is that the attacker is black, and the evidence E is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's break down the probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the city's demographics. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.

2. P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(E|~H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is white 85% of the time, and the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

4. P(H): The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
