Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of event A, P(B) is the prior probability of evidence B, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of evidence B given event A.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (P(A) = 0.15).

The prior probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly is 0.8 (P(B|A) = 0.8), and the prior probability of the witness identifying a black person incorrectly is 0.2 (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

The probability of the witness making an incorrect identification is therefore 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

The total probability of the witness making a correct identification (either of a black person or a white person) is P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.333.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 33.3%.
