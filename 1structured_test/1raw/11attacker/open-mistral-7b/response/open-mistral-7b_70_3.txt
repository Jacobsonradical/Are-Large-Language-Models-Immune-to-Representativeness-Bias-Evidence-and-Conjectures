Based on the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is an estimate of 0.88.

Here's the reasoning:
1. According to the first piece of information, 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. The second piece of information states that a witness identified the attacker as black, but the witness's ability to judge a person's race is only 80% accurate (correctly identifying race in 80% of cases and erring in 20% of cases).
3. Since we don't have any other information that could potentially influence the witness's identification, we can assume that the probability of the witness making a correct identification is the same for both white and black individuals.
4. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is equal to the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black individuals.
5. So, the probability is 0.8 (80%).
6. However, since the witness's identification might have been an error, we should consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake.
7. If the witness made an error, they would have identified a white individual as black. Given the witness's error rate, the probability of this happening is 0.2 (20%).
8. Since the true probability of the attacker being black is either 0.8 (if the witness was correct) or 0 (if the witness was wrong), we can calculate the overall probability by adding the two possibilities weighted by their probabilities: 0.8 * 0.8 + 0 * 0.2 = 0.64 + 0 = 0.64.
9. However, we made an assumption that the error rate for identifying white individuals is the same as for black individuals. This might not be the case, as people might be better at identifying their own race or the race they are more familiar with. To account for this, we can adjust our estimate.
10. If we assume that the error rate for identifying white individuals is lower than for black individuals, the probability of the witness making an error (identifying a white individual as black) would be lower. The exact value of the lower error rate would depend on the specifics of how the error rate differs between white and black individuals. Let's assume a lower error rate of 10% for identifying white individuals. This would mean that the probability of the witness making an error (identifying a white individual as black) is 0.1 (10%).
11. In this case, the overall probability of the attacker being black would be 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.64 + 0.02 = 0.66.
12. Therefore, taking into account the possibility of the witness making an error, the estimated probability of the attacker being black ranges from 0.64 to 0.66.
13. However, since we are looking for a strict answer in the dictionary format, we can round up to the nearest tenth: {probability: 0.88, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
