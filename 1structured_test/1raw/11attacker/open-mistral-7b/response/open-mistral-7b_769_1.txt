To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (making an error). Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this case, we should consider both possibilities:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black, as the witness stated. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.8.

2. The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified them as black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.2.

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. If the witness made an error, the probability of them incorrectly identifying a white person as black is higher than the probability of them incorrectly identifying a black person as white. This is because there are more white people in the city.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

Scenario 1 (witness was correct):
- Probability of attacker being black given witness's statement = 0.8 (witness's reliability)

Scenario 2 (witness was wrong, but due to the higher number of white people, they mistakenly identified a white person as black):
- Probability of attacker being white given witness's statement = 0.2 / (1 - 0.8) * 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.065

Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city, is the weighted sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 * 1 + 0.065 * 0 = 0.815, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.815 or 81.5%.
