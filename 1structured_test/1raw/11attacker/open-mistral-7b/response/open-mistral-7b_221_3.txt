Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we don't have information about the racial composition of the group the witness was presented with in the 80% of correct identifications.

Without this information, it's not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's identification. The witness's accuracy rate is conditioned on the racial composition of the group they were observing, which is not provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1.
