Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (P(Black|Attack)), given the information that the witness identified the attacker as black (P(Black|Witness)) and the prior probability that the attacker is black in the city (P(Black)).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. P(Black) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(Black|Witness) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)

We need to find P(Witness|Black), which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This can be calculated using the accuracy of the witness as given: P(Witness|Black) = 0.8

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Black|Attack) = P(Black) * P(Witness|Black) / P(Witness)

Since we don't have information about P(Witness), we can't find the exact probability. However, we can make an assumption that P(Witness) is equal for all races, as the witness was not biased and the attack happened at night, making it difficult to determine the race.

Under this assumption, P(Witness) = P(White|Attack) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(Black|Attack):

P(Black|Attack) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.1492 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.1492 or 14.92%. Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. In a real-world scenario, more information would be required to make a more accurate estimate.
