Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (from information a)
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 1 (assuming that the witness is always correct when the attacker is black)
3. P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 (from information b)
4. P(~A) = Probability that the attacker is not black = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
         = 1 * 0.15 / (0.2 * 0.85 + 1 * 0.15)
         = 0.15 / 0.35
         = 0.4286

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.4286 or 42.86%.
