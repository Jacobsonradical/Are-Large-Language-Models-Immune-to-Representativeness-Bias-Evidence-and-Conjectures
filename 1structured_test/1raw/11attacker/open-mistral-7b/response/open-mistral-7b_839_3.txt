Given the information provided, the population distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not perfectly reliable in determining a person's race, has identified the attacker as black.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness correctly identified a black attacker and the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker is P(black) * 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white attacker as black is 1 - P(black) * 0.8 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability that this occurred due to a correct identification or an error is the sum of these two probabilities: P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black) * 0.8).

However, we know that the actual probability of the attacker being black in the population is 15%. So, we can set up an equation to find the probability P(black) that satisfies this relationship:

15% = P(black) * 0.8 + (1 - P(black) * 0.8) * 15%

Solving this equation, we get:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
