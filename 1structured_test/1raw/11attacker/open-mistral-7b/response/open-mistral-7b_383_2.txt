Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: 1) the racial demographics of the city (85% white, 15% black), and 2) the witness's ability to accurately identify race, with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

However, there's a crucial piece of information missing: we don't know if the witness's identification of the attacker as black is considered a correct identification or an error. Without this information, it's impossible to make a precise probability estimate.

If we assume that the witness's identification is always correct (which is unlikely given the error rate of 20%), then the probability that the attacker is black would be 100%. If we assume that the witness's identification is always an error (which is also unlikely), then the probability that the attacker is black would be 0%.

Given the limited information and the uncertainty involved, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. However, if we consider the racial demographics of the city alone, the probability that the attacker is black would be approximately 15%, based on the given statistics.
