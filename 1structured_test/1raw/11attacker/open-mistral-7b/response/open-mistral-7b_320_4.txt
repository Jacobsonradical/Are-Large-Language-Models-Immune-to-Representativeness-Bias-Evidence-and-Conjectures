To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observed evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker's race (black or white), and the observed evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (unknown)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given by the witness's ability: 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white (given by the witness's ability: 0.2)
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony (which is the probability we want to estimate)
- P(~B|W) as the probability that the attacker is not black given the witness's testimony

From the information provided, we know P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white), P(W|B) = 0.8, and P(W|~B) = 0.2.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
