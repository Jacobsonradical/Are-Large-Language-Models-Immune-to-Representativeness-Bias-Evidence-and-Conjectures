To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information about whether the witness made a correct or incorrect identification in this specific case, we can't use the witness's statement directly to determine the probability of the attacker's race.

However, we do know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races, then the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case (given that the attacker is black) is equal to the probability of the witness making an error in a random case.

The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness making an error in a random case is 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means that either the witness made a correct identification or made an error in identifying the attacker as black. The probability of the first event is the probability of the attacker being black, which we are trying to estimate. The probability of the second event is 0.2 (the probability of the witness making an error in a random case).

Therefore, we can express the probability of the attacker being black as the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 1 minus the probability of the witness making an error in a random case:

{probability: 0.8}

This estimate assumes that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races and that the witness's statement is reliable given these assumptions. However, without more information, it's impossible to say for certain whether these assumptions hold.
