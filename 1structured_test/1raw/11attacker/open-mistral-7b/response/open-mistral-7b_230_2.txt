Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts: the actual probability of the attacker being black in the city, and the probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race.

1. The probability of the attacker being black in the city is given as 15%.

2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. Similarly, the witness correctly identifies a white person as white 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. The probability of this happening is the error rate, which is 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually white, despite the witness's identification, is the error rate. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 1 minus the error rate.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
