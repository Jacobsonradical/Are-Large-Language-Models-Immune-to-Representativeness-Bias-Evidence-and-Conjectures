To provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, the witness's ability to identify race was only 80% accurate, with a 20% error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we must account for the possibility that they made an error.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black as P(error). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification:

P(black | witnessed_black) = [P(witnessed_black | black) * P(black)] / [P(witnessed_black | black) * P(black) + P(witnessed_black | not black) * P(not black)]

From the information given, we know that P(black) = 0.15, P(witnessed_black | black) = 0.8, and P(witnessed_black | not black) = 0 (since the witness did not identify a white person as black in this case).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(black | witnessed_black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and their known error rate, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%). However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case in real-world situations. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation.
