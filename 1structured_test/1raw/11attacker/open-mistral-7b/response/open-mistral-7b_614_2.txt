To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

In our case, H is the event "attacker is black" and E is the event "witness identifies attacker as black".

We are given the following information:

1. P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = Unknown (prior probability of the attacker being black)
3. P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6 (witness's overall accuracy in identifying races)

We also know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.6 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case. If the witness has a bias towards identifying black people as attackers, then this estimate would be an underestimate. On the other hand, if the witness has a bias towards identifying white people as attackers, then this estimate would be an overestimate. Without more information, it is difficult to say for certain.
