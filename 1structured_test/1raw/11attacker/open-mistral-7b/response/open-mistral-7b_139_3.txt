To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is random (which may not be entirely accurate given potential biases, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity), we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black based on the city's demographics.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%). If we assume that the witness's accuracy holds true for all races, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black would be their accuracy rate times the actual probability of the attacker being black: 0.8 (80%) * 0.15 (15%) = 0.12 (12%).

However, since we know that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we need to account for this as well. We can do this by multiplying the actual probability of the attacker being black by the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race: 0.15 (15%) * 1 = 0.15 (15%). Then, we can multiply this by the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race given that they are black: 0.8 (80%) * 0.15 (15%) = 0.12 (12%).

Finally, we need to multiply this by the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race and still identifies them as black: 0.2 (20%) * 0.15 (15%) = 0.03 (3%).

Adding these probabilities together, we get: 0.15 (15%) + 0.12 (12%) + 0.03 (3%) = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 29%.
