Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows for the updating of probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%, as stated in the first piece of information. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person is 0.2 (20%). Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can assume that the event B occurred.

So, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
       = 0.12 / 0.262
       = 0.457

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.457 or 45.7%.
