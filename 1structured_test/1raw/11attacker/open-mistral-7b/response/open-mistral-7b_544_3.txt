To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness statement)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

We are given the following:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = ? (prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)) (probability of the witness making a correct statement, which depends on the prior probability)

Unfortunately, we are not given the prior probability (P(H)). However, we can use the information about the racial distribution in the city to make an educated guess. According to the second piece of information, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Therefore, without further information, a reasonable assumption would be that the prior probability of the attacker being black is also 15%.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.12 (estimate of the probability that the attacker is black)

So, given the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
