Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is black," and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness stated the attacker is black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness stating the attacker is black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness stating the attacker is black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black

Given that the witness's accuracy in determining race is 80% and the error rate is 20%, we can calculate P(E|H) and P(E|~H):

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race as black 20% of the time)

Since 85% of the population in the city is white, the prior probability of the attacker being black is:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.28

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.28 or 28%.
