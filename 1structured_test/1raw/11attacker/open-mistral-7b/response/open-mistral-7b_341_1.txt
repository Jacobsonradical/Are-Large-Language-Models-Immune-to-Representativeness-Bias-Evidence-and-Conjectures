Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identify race is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of an event A (attacker being black) given the probability of another event B (witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is written as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identifies attacker as black

Given the information, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is 15% (from point 2).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is the witness's success rate, which is 80%.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(B|not A)) is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(not A) (the prior probability of the attacker being white) and P(B|not A) (the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white). Without these two pieces of information, we cannot calculate the probability of the attacker being black (P(A|B)) directly using Bayes' theorem.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format. To estimate the probability, we would need more information about the witness's error rate when identifying white people and the prior probability of the attacker being white.
