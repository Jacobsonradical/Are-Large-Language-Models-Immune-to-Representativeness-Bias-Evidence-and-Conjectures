Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The overall racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate is not specified in relation to the attacker's race. We don't know if the witness misidentifies more often when the attacker is white or when the attacker is black. Without this information, it's not possible to make a definitive probability estimate for the attacker's race.

Therefore, based on the given data, I cannot provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1 for the attacker being black.
