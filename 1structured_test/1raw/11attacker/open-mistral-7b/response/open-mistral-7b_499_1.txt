To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(E) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black

Given that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is 80% accurate and 20% erroneous, we can calculate P(W) and P(E) as follows:

P(W) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person) + 0 (probability of correctly identifying a white person) = 0.8
P(E) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

The witness identifies the attacker as black. So, there are two possible scenarios:

1) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race: P(B) * P(W)
2) The attacker is actually white, and the witness erroneously identifies the attacker's race: P(not B) * P(E)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation based on the Bayes' theorem (P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Given that the total probability of correctly identifying a person's race should equal 1, we can calculate P(not B) as 1 - P(B).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information:
