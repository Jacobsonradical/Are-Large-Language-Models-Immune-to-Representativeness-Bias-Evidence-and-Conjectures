Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's observation is independent of the population distribution (which may not be the case in reality), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the witness's observation. We know P(E|H) from the witness's accuracy, P(H) from the population distribution, and we can calculate P(E) as the sum of the probabilities of both events (attacker is black and the witness makes a correct observation, or attacker is not black and the witness makes an error).

First, let's calculate P(E|H):

P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability of correct observation given attacker is black) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H):

P(H) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being black, given the city's population distribution)

Now we need to calculate P(E|not H):

P(E|not H) = 0.2 (probability of error given attacker is not black)

Finally, we need to calculate P(not H):

P(not H) = 0.85 (probability of attacker not being black, given the city's population distribution)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.1765
P(E) ≈ 0.2965

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2965
P(H|E) ≈ 0.336

So, given the information and assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.336 or 33.6%.
