Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (they get it right 8 out of 10 times) and they make an error 20% of the time.
2. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can't use their race as direct evidence. However, we do have the witness's testimony. If we assume that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the race of the attacker (i.e., the witness's bias is consistent), then we can use the witness's track record to make an estimate.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which is an error in this case because according to the population statistics, the probability of a random attacker being black is 15%. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is actually a true identification (i.e., the attacker is black) is:

{probability: 0.20 / 0.20 + 0.15 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, given the information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%. This is a significantly lower probability than the actual population proportion of black people in the city, which could suggest that the witness's ability to judge race is less accurate than the population statistics suggest, or that there are other factors at play that we're not considering in this analysis.
