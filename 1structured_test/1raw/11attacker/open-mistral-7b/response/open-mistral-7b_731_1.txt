Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The racial composition of the city, with 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, the initial probability of the attacker being black is simply the proportion of black people in the city: 0.15 or 15%.

However, we also have the witness's statement that the attacker is black. Given the witness's reliability, we need to adjust our initial probability. The witness mistakenly identifies the race of a person 20% of the time, so there's a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken in this case.

Therefore, the adjusted probability of the attacker being black is the initial probability (15%) multiplied by the probability that the witness is not mistaken (1 - 0.20):

{probability: 0.15 * (1 - 0.20), probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12}

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
