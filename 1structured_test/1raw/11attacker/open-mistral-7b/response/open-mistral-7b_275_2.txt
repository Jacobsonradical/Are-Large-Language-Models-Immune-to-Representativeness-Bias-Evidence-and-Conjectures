Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Assuming that the witness's racial proficiency is independent of the population distribution, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's statement and the population statistics.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white).

Given the witness's statement, we have:
P(black) = probability that the witness identified the attacker as black | the attacker is black
P(black) = 0.8 (assuming the attacker is black)

Given the population statistics, we have:
P(white) = probability that the attacker is white
P(white) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)

Since the attacker can only be either black or white, we have:
P(black) + P(white) = 1

We can now solve for P(black):
0.8 = P(black)

However, the witness's statement only gives us a conditional probability, not the actual probability. To convert the conditional probability to an actual probability, we need to know the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is not given in the information.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate. We can only say that the witness's statement suggests that the attacker is likely black, but without additional information, we cannot quantify that probability.
