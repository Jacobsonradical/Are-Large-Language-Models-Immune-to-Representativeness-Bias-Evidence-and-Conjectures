Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. Since 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the probability of encountering a white person in a random encounter is 0.85 and that of a black person is 0.15.

Given these probabilities, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%). The probability of the witness erring and incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

However, we were given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that the attack actually happened in one of the two possible scenarios: either the witness correctly identified a black person (12% probability) or they erroneously identified a white person as black (17% probability).

Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

So, the probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
