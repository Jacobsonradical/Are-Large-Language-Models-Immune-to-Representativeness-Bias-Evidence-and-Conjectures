To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's judgment and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The witness's mistake rate is 20%, which means the probability of them correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given the racial composition of the city, the probability of the attacker being white is P(white) = 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is P(black) = 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given the witness's reliability, the probability that they made a correct identification is 0.8 * P(black) = 0.12.

However, the witness also has a chance of making a mistake and identifying a white person as black. The probability of this happening is 0.2 * P(white) = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that their identification is correct or they made a mistake and identified a white person as black is:

P(correct_or_mistake) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Since the witness's identification cannot possibly be both correct and a mistake, we need to subtract the probability of their identification being a mistake from the total probability:

P(black) = P(correct_or_mistake) - P(mistake) = 0.29 - 0.17 = 0.12

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12.
