To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not observed directly, there's a 20% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is incorrect.

However, the witness's identification could also be correct. The probability of this depends on the racial composition of the city's population. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we need to account for the possibility of the witness's error. If the attacker is actually white, there's a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify him as black. This means that the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 - 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.52 (52%).

Since the witness's identification could be incorrect, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If the attacker is actually black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying him is 0.8.
2. If the attacker is actually white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying him as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, considering both scenarios, is the sum of these probabilities: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.228 (22.8%).

However, as mentioned earlier, there's a 20% chance that the witness's identification is incorrect. If the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black, the actual attacker could be white. In this case, the probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.2 (20%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.2 * 0.228 = 0.046 (4.6%).

Since it's more reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate is higher than 20% in this case, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is likely to be lower than 4.6%. However, without more information, a precise estimate cannot be provided.

{probability: 0.046, please note that this is a conservative estimate and the actual probability may be lower}
