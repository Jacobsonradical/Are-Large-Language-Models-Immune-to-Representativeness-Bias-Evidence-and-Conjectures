To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. In this case, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if the witness was correct or if this was an error.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

Given this information, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's testimony alone, as we don't know if the witness was correct or incorrect in this specific case.

However, we can calculate the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white attacker as black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, they incorrectly identify race 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of choosing a white person at random is 0.85. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

This means that the witness's testimony increases the likelihood of the attacker being black, but it does not definitively prove that the attacker is black. Therefore, while the witness's testimony suggests that the attacker might be black, it does not provide strong enough evidence to make a definitive estimate.

As a result, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate in the format you requested. However, the witness's testimony does suggest that the attacker might be black, but it does not conclusively prove this.
