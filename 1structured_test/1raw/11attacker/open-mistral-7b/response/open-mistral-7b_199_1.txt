To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the witness encountering a black person is 0.15 (15%). When the witness encounters a black person, they will correctly identify them as black 80% of the time.

On the other hand, since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85 (85%). When the witness encounters a white person, they will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since the witness claimed that the attacker was black, it means that they either encountered a black person and correctly identified them or encountered a white person and incorrectly identified them as black.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

1. Probability of encountering a black person and correctly identifying them: 0.15 (probability of encountering a black person) * 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person) = 0.12

2. Probability of encountering a white person and incorrectly identifying them as black: 0.85 (probability of encountering a white person) * 0.20 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black) = 0.17

The total probability of the witness's statement being correct is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29, or 29%.
