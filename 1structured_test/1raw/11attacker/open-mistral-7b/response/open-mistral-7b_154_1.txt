Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, reported that the attacker was black.

We cannot directly use the population statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, because the witness's report may not be accurate. However, we can use the witness's error rate to correct for potential misidentifications.

If the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, then there is a 20% chance that they incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that, in reality, the attacker could be white 20% of the time.

However, we also know that 85% of the city's population is white. If we subtract the 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually white given the witness's report:

Probability of attacker being white given witness report = 1 - Probability of witness error
                                                                                 = 1 - 0.2
                                                                                 = 0.8

Since the witness has reported that the attacker is black, and there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct, we can multiply this probability by the probability that the attacker is white given the witness's report (which we just calculated) to estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness being correct * Probability of attacker being white given witness report
                                                      = 0.8 * 0.2
                                                      = 0.16

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is 0.16 or 16%.
