Given the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black with an 80% accuracy rate and a 20% error rate. Since the witness made an identification, we can now consider this new information.

Let's analyze this situation using Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being black
- Event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's demographic makeup)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying a black person)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  (This is Bayes' theorem, where P(B|not A) is the witness's error rate in identifying a non-black person and P(not A) = 1 - P(A))

We are also given that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying a white person)

Now, we can calculate P(B).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the witness's identification and the given demographic information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48.
