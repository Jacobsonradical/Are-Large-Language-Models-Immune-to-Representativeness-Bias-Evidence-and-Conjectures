To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is "The attacker is black," and the evidence is "The witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black
- P(B|W) as the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified a black person
- P(~B|W) as the probability of the attacker not being black given that the witness identified a black person

We are given the following information:
1) P(B) = ? (This is what we want to find)
2) P(W|B) = 0.8
3) P(W|~B) = 0.2
4) P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or white)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We know P(W|B) and P(W|~B), but we don't have P(B) yet. However, we do know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. So, we can approximate P(B) as 0.15 and compute P(~B) = 0.85.

Now, let's calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

After computing, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.38

So, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.38.
