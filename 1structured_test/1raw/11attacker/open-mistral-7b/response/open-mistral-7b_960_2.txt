To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race as black, given that the attacker is actually white, is 20%. We can denote this probability as P(witness misidentifies | attacker is white).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85, and the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.

The Bayes' theorem formula to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is:

P(black | witness statement) = [P(witness statement | black) * P(black)] / [P(witness statement | black) * P(black) + P(witness statement | not black) * P(not black)]

We have:
P(witness statement | black) = 0.8 (from the information in the question)
P(black) = 0.15
P(witness statement | not black) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is white)
P(not black) = 0.85

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(black | witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.22 or 22%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's statement, is {probability: 0.22}.
