Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

If the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:
1. The attacker is actually black.
2. The witness mistakenly identified a white person as black.

The probability of the first event (the attacker is black) is the proportion of black people in the city. However, we need to account for the probability of the second event (mistaken identification) in our estimate.

The probability of the second event is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is given as 20%. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of randomly selecting a white person is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black given the witness's identification is the probability of the first event divided by the sum of the probabilities of both events:

{probability: 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.47, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.47.
