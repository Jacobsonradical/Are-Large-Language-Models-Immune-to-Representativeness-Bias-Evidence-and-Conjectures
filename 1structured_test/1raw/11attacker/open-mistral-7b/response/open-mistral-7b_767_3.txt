Based on the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is not perfectly accurate, as they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is a random event with a 50-50 chance of being black or white, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) multiplied by the probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black, P(A) is 0.5 (50% chance of the attacker being black), and P(B) is the overall probability of the witness making a correct identification.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8 (80% of the time).

P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2 (20% of the time).

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the overall probability of the witness making a correct identification (event B) is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.15
    = 0.4 + 0.03
    = 0.43

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.43
       â‰ˆ 0.695

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.695 or 69.5%.
