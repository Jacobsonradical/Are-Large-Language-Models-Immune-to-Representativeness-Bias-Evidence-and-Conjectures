To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 80%. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of the attacker being black given a correct identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we need to account for this error. The probability of the witness making this error if the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (as calculated above). The probability of the witness making this error if the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood ratio is the ratio of these probabilities:

Likelihood ratio = P(attacker is black | witness's identification) / P(attacker is white | witness's identification)
                           = 0.12 / 0.17
                           ≈ 0.71

Since the likelihood ratio is greater than 1, the witness's identification is more likely to be correct if the attacker is black than if the attacker is white. Therefore, we can adjust the probability of the attacker being black based on this likelihood ratio:

Adjusted probability = P(attacker is black) * likelihood ratio
                                  = 0.15 * 0.71
                                  ≈ 0.1065

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 10.65%.
