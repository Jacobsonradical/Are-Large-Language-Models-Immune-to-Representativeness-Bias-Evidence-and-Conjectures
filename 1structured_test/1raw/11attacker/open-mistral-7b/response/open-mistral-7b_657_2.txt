To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. If the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability of the witness being correct as P(correct|black). The probability of the witness being incorrect, given that the attacker is black, is P(incorrect|black) = 1 - P(correct|black).

We know that the probability of the witness being correct is 0.8, and the proportion of black people in the city is 0.15. The proportion of white people in the city is therefore 0.85.

The witness identifies the attacker as black. Given this information, what is the probability that the attacker is black?

P(black|attacker identified as black) = P(attacker is black and witness is correct) / P(attacker is black or witness is incorrect)

P(attacker is black and witness is correct) = P(black) * P(correct|black)
P(attacker is black or witness is incorrect) = P(black) * P(correct|black) + P(!black) * P(incorrect|black)

P(black) = 0.15
P(correct|black) = 0.8
P(incorrect|black) = 1 - P(correct|black) = 0.2

P(attacker is black and witness is correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(attacker is black or witness is incorrect) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.24

P(black|attacker identified as black) = 0.12 / 0.24 = 0.5

So, based on the information provided, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.5 (or 50%). This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's identification.
