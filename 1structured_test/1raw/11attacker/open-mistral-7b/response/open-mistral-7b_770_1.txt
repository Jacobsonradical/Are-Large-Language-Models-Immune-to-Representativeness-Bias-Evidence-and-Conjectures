In this scenario, we have two pieces of information: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, it's important to note that the victim could not see the attacker's race, and the witness's identification is not based on the actual attacker. The witness's identification is based on a sample of people, half white and half black, which might not accurately represent the attacker's race.

Therefore, while the witness's identification suggests that the attacker might be black, it's not sufficient evidence to override the racial composition of the city. Given that the victim could not see the attacker's race, we should base our estimate on the city's racial composition.

{probability: 0.15}

This estimate assumes that the attacker's race is not different from the city's racial composition, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race and the witness's identification is not based on the actual attacker.
