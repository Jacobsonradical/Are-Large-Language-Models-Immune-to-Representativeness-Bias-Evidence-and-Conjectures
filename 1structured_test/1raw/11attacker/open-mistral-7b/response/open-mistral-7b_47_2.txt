To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E (P(H|E)) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) times the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) divided by the probability of the evidence (P(E)).

Let's break this down:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given the population statistics (item b), we can calculate this as 15% (or 0.15).

2. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information provided (item a), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. So if the attacker is indeed black, there's an 80% chance the witness will correctly identify them as such.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness being wrong, which is 0.8 (80%) + 0.2 (20%).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8)

Simplifying:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 12%.
