The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness stated that the attacker was black, but their ability to correctly identify race is only 80% accurate.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified a person's race 20% of the time, we need to account for this error rate in our estimate. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual racial distribution in the city, then for every 100 attacks, the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black 20 times and incorrectly identify a black person as white 20 times.

However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black, which means they must have gotten it right at least once in these 100 attacks. So, in the remaining 80 attacks, the true distribution of the attackers' races might be different from the city's racial distribution.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness got it right in these 80 attacks. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, they're correct 80% of the time. So, the probability of getting it right in 80 trials is (0.8)^80 â‰ˆ 0.000000000016. This is an extremely small probability, which suggests that the witness's error rate is not independent of the actual racial distribution in this case.

Given that we cannot rely on the witness's statement, our best estimate should be based on the city's racial distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.
