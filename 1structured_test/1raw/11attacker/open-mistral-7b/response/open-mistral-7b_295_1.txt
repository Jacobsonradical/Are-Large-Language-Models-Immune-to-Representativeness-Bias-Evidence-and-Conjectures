Given the information, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

The probability of the attacker being black can be estimated by considering both the witness's accuracy and the population composition.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1 and we have two pieces of information:
1) The witness identified the attacker as black with a 80% chance, which means P(B | observed) = 0.8
2) The attacker is more likely to be white due to the population composition, P(W) > P(B)

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black:

P(B | observed) = P(observed | B) * P(B) / P(observed)

We are given P(B | observed) = 0.8, P(W) = 0.15 (1 - 0.15 = 0.85), and P(observed | B) and P(observed | W) are not provided, but we can reason about them based on the witness's accuracy and the population composition.

Since the witness is incorrect in 20% of the cases, the likelihood of the attacker being white given that the observer saw a black person is 0.2. However, since the attacker is more likely to be white due to population composition, the likelihood of the attacker being white given that the observer saw a white person is likely to be higher than 0.2.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(observed | W) directly, we can use Bayes' theorem again to estimate P(W | observed):

P(W | observed) = P(observed | W) * P(W) / P(observed)

We can assume that P(observed | W) < P(observed | B) due to the witness's lower accuracy in identifying black people.

However, we can't estimate the exact values of P(observed | B) and P(observed | W) without more information, so we can't provide a strict numerical answer to the question.

To provide a rough estimate, we can assume that P(observed | W) = 0.5 (halfway between 0 and 0.8) and calculate P(W | observed):

P(W | observed) = 0.5 * 0.15 / P(observed)

Since P(observed | W) is lower than P(observed | B), P(W | observed) is lower than P(B | observed), and the attacker is more likely to be black than white.

Therefore, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.8 and less than 1, but we cannot provide a specific number without more information.
