To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

We know that:
1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

When the witness makes an error, they incorrectly identify a white person as black or a black person as white. Since they make errors 20% of the time, this means that they correctly identify race 80% of the time, or 80% - 20% = 60% of the time when they are looking at a person of the same race as the majority of the population (in this case, white).

On the other hand, when the witness is looking at a person of the minority race (in this case, black), they get it right 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black. This happens 20% of the time when the witness is looking at a white person.
2. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. This happens 80% of the time when the witness is looking at a black person.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of scenario 1 is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%), and the probability of scenario 2 is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of scenario 2: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
