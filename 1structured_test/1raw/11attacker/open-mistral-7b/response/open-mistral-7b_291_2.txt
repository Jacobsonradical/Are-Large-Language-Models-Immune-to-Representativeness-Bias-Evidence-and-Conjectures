Given the information provided, the attacker being identified as black by the witness does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80%, which means there is a 20% chance of error.

Since we don't have any other information suggesting that the attacker is more likely to be one race over the other, we can assume that the population statistics apply to the attacker as well. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification for a black person, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can add the probability of a correct identification (0.8) to the probability of a mistake in identifying a white person as black (0.17). This gives us a total probability of 0.97 (or 97%) that the attacker is either black or misidentified as black.

However, we must subtract the probability of correctly identifying a white person as white (0.12) from this total, as this would mean that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as white. This gives us a final estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, of 0.97 - 0.12 = 0.85 (or 85%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.85} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
