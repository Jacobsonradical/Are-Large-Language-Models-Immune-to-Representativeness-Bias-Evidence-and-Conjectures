The given information suggests that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is generally correct 80% of the time in identifying races but errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we should consider both the city's demographics and the witness's error rate. Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness's error was in this case or not, we must consider both possibilities.

Let's denote P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black. We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1, where P(W) is the probability that the attacker is white.

Given the city's demographics, P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15. However, the witness's error rate means that we should adjust these probabilities. Let's denote the probability of the witness erring as E. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, E = 0.2.

We can represent the situation as a decision tree:

```
                         P(B) = 0.15
                         |
P(B) * (1-E) -------------|------------ P(B) * E
                         |
                    0.12   |  0.03
                         |
P(W) * (1-E) -------------|------------ P(W) * E
                         |
                    0.73   |  0.17
```

In the decision tree, the top branch represents the correct identification of the attacker's race, while the bottom branch represents the witness's error. The left branches represent the attacker being black, and the right branches represent the attacker being white.

The probabilities at the leaves of the tree are calculated as follows:

* P(B) * (1-E) is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12).
* P(B) * E is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness errs, identifying the attacker as white (0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03).
* P(W) * (1-E) is the probability that the attacker is white and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race (0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68).
* P(W) * E is the probability that the attacker is white and the witness errs, identifying the attacker as black (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).

The sum of the probabilities at the leaves of the tree is 0.12 + 0.03 + 0.68 + 0.17 = 1, indicating that the probabilities indeed add up to 1.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the sum of the probabilities at the bottom leaves of the tree, which is 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.20.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2, given the witness's identification and error rate. However, it is important to note that this estimate may not reflect the true probability, as we made several assumptions about the witness's error rate and the error in this specific case.
