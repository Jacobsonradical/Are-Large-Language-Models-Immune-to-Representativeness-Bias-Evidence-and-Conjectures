Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A represents the event that the attacker is black, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, so 15% black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time)
4. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We don't have the value for P(~A) (probability of the attacker being white), but we can find P(B) by substituting values into the equation:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.182
P(B) = 0.302

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.302
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.31

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
