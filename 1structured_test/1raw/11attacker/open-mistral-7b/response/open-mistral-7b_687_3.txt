Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black, which means the witness made a correct identification or an error.

Since we do not know whether the witness made a correct identification or an error, we cannot directly use the witness's success rate without additional information. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is black," and B is the event "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which we know from the witness's ability to judge race).

To find P(B|A), we can use the principle of total probability, which states that:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we do not have information about P(B|not A), we cannot directly calculate P(B). However, we can make an assumption. If we assume that the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a white person as black is the same as their ability to incorrectly identify a black person as white (20%), then P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
                 â‰ˆ 0.259

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.259 or 25.9%.
