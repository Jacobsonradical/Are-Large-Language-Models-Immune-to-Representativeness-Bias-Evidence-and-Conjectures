To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness is incorrect 20% of the time (as stated in point b). Let's assume that the witness identifies the attacker's race correctly in 80% of the cases, and incorrectly in 20% of the cases. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black (true positive).
2. The witness errs and identifies a white person as black (false positive).

The probability of the first scenario (the attacker is black) is the probability of a true positive divided by the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives.

The probability of a false positive is the probability of a white person being incorrectly identified as black by the witness. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a false positive is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness's error rate multiplied by the percentage of white people).

The probability of a true positive is the percentage of black people in the city multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying black people. Given that 15% of the city's population is black, the probability of a true positive is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41 (41%).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness is mistaken and the attacker is white. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black is simply the percentage of black people in the city, which is 0.15.

Since we don't have enough information to accurately weigh the reliability of the witness's identification against the racial composition of the city, we will provide two estimates:

{probability: 0.41, alternative_probability: 0.15}
