To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(White) = 1 - P(Black).

The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. Since the population is half black and half white, the probability of a random person being black is 0.5, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying that person as white is 0.2. This means that the probability of a random person being white, given that the witness incorrectly identifies them as black, is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the actual attacker being black is the probability of a black person being incorrectly identified as black divided by the sum of the probabilities of a black person and a white person being incorrectly identified as black.

P(Black | Witness's statement) = Probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as black / (Probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as black + Probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

= 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.8 * Probability of a white person being incorrectly identified as black)

From the information given, we know that the probability of a random person being white is 0.8, and the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of a white person being incorrectly identified as black is 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.

Now we can calculate P(Black | Witness's statement):

P(Black | Witness's statement) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.16 * 0.8) â‰ˆ 0.57

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.57, or 57%.
