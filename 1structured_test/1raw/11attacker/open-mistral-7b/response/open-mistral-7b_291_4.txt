Given the information provided, we have two key pieces of data:

1. The racial makeup of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we should consider the probability of the witness being correct given the racial distribution of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate P(black) as follows:

P(black) = Probability given witness's identification * True probability of attacker being black
              = Witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person * Percentage of black population
              = 0.8 * 0.15
              = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This answer assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker. If there are other factors at play, the calculation might need to be adjusted accordingly.
