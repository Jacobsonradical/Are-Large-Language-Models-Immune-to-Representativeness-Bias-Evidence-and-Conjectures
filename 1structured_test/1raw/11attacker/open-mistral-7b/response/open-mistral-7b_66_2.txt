To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the demographic data of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. According to the demographic data, 15% of the city's population is black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (erring in identifying race).

Assuming that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the person, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black and given that the attacker is white:

- If the attacker is black: The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as white is 0.2 (20%).
- If the attacker is white: The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 0.8 (80%).

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to weigh these probabilities by their corresponding probabilities in the population:

- Probability of the attacker being black: 0.15 (15%)
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%)
- Probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%)

Since the witness's mistake in identifying a white attacker as black is equally likely as the witness's correct identification of a black attacker, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as the sum of the two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, probability estimate: 0.29}

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
