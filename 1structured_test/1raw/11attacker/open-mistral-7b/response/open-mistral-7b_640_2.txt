Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black, which means this identification was either correct or an error.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness would err, given their 20% error rate. However, since the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white is high. Therefore, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is more likely to be an error than a correct identification.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of erring when the attacker is white is 0.2 (20%).

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black, divided by the total probability of the witness making a correct identification or an error.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%). The total probability of making a correct identification or an error is the sum of the probability of making a correct identification and the probability of making an error, which is 0.8 (80%) + 0.2 (20%) = 1.

So, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8. The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is therefore 0.8 / 1 = 0.8 (or 80%).

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case. If the witness is more likely to err when the attacker is black, then the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, would be lower than 0.8.

Without more information, it is not possible to provide a more precise estimate. Therefore, the best estimate based on the information given is {probability: 0.8}.
