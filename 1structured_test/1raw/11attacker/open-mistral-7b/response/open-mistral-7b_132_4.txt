Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race. This means that even if the attacker was actually black, the victim would not have been able to confirm this.

Therefore, the only piece of information we have is the racial composition of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black. Since we cannot use the witness's identification as evidence, we should base our estimate on the city's racial demographics.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics, is 15% or 0.15.
