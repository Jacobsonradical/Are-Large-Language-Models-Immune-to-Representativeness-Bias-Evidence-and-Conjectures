Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume the attacker's race is a random event with two possible outcomes: black or white. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the population distribution.

First, we need to understand that the witness's statement is not reliable in this case because they could not see the attacker's race. However, we can use the witness's reliability in a different context. Since the population distribution is known, we can calculate the expected error rate if the witness were to make a guess based on the population distribution.

The expected error rate for a white person being mistakenly identified as black is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city). For a black person being mistakenly identified as white is 85% (the proportion of white people in the city). The overall expected error rate is the weighted average of these two error rates, which can be calculated as follows:

Expected error rate = (Proportion of white people * Error rate for white person being identified as black) + (Proportion of black people * Error rate for black person being identified as white)

Expected error rate = (0.85 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85) = 0.1225 or 12.25%

Now, the witness stated that they identified the attacker as black with 80% accuracy. This means that when they actually saw a black person, they correctly identified them as such 80% of the time. The remaining 20% of the time, they would have incorrectly identified a white person as black.

Since the witness's statement is not reliable, we cannot use it directly to infer the attacker's race. However, we can use it to make an indirect inference. If we assume that the witness's statement is consistent with the population distribution (which it should be if the witness is making random guesses), then the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the expected error rate for a white person being mistakenly identified as black, which is 15%.

However, since we know that the witness's actual accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they identified the attacker as black, we should give more weight to this information. A more reasonable estimate would be to use the witness's actual accuracy rate of 80% as the probability that they are correct when they say the attacker is black.

So, our final estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}

This means that, based on the available information, we estimate that there is an 80% probability that the attacker is black.
