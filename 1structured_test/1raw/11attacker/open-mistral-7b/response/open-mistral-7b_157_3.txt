The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If the attacker's race is indeed black, the witness will correctly identify it 80% of the time. However, if the attacker is white, the witness will mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since we know that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. If the attacker is white, there's a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify them as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them, plus the probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes a mistake, divided by the total probability of the witness's identification.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

{probability: (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2), probability: 0.33}

So, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.33 or 33%.
