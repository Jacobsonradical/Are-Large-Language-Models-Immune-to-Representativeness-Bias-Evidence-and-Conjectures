To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness's ability to correctly identify race)

We are given the following information:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify race)
- P(H) = ? (unknown prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) = 0.5 * P(E | H) + 0.5 * P(E | not H) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.6 (from the population statistics)

We are also given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. This means that P(E | not H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = (0.8 * P(H)) / 0.6

We can solve for P(H) by rearranging the equation:

P(H) = (0.6 * P(H | E)) / 0.8

We are asked to estimate P(H | E), which we can calculate as:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H | E) = (0.8 * P(H)) / 0.6
P(H | E) = (0.6 * (0.6 * P(H | E)) / 0.6) / 0.6
P(H | E) = 0.36 * P(H | E)

To find a solution, we can use trial and error or numerical methods. However, since we are only interested in a probability estimate, we can assume that P(H | E) is close to the value that makes the equation hold true.

Let's assume that P(H | E) = 0.7. Then, we can calculate P(H):

P(H) = (0.6 * 0.7) / 0.6 = 0.42

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.42 or 42%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is unaffected by the lighting conditions, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation.
