To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black

Given the information, we know that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|~B) = 0.2. We also know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Let P(W) be the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as black, which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)

Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we have P(B) = 0.15 and P(~B) = 0.85. Substituting these values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. So we can set up an equation based on the conditional probability:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) / P(W)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.276

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.276}
