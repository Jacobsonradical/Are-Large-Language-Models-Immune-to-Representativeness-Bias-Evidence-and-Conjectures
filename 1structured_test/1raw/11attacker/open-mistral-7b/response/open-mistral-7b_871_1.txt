Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's break down the terms in the equation:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume that the attacker could be either black or white, so P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city).

2. P(E|H): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. The witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(E|~H): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness was wrong 20% of the time when the attacker was white, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

4. P(H): This is the probability of the witness's statement being true, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness was correct 80% of the time, P(E) = 0.8.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8
       = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%.
