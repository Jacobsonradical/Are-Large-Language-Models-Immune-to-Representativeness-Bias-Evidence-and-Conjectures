To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(~W) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white

Given that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, we have:
P(W) = 0.8

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we also have:
P(~W) = 1 - P(W) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is white, we have:
P(W|B) = 0.8

And given that 15% of the population is black, we have:
P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(~W|B) * P(~B)

However, we do not have enough information to calculate P(~W|B) or P(~B). Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact probability that the attacker is black based on this information.

In conclusion, {probability: Unable to calculate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
