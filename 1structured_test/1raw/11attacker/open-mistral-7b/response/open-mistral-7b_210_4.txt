To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability of the witness's testimony)

In this case, A = "attacker is black," B = "witness identifies attacker as black," P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), P(A) = x (the prior probability of the attacker being black), and P(B) = 0.85 * x + 0.15 * (1-x) (the probability of the witness's testimony, given the population distribution).

To find x, we can set up an equation using Bayes' theorem and solve for x:

x = [0.8 * P(A|B) * (0.15)] / [0.85 * P(A|B) * (0.15) + 0.15 * (1-P(A|B)) * (0.85)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

x = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * (1-0.8)]
x = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.15 * 0.2
x = 0.12 + 0.03
x = 0.15

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is 15%.
