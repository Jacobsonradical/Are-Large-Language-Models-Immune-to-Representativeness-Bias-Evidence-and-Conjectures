Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, we don't have specific information about whether the witness was more likely to err in identifying black people as white or white people as black. Let's assume that the errors are equally likely, which means the witness's true error rate is 10% (half of the 20% error rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness making a false positive (identifying a white person as black).

In terms of the racial composition of the city, 15% of the population is black. So, the probability of a randomly chosen person being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness making a false positive is therefore the probability of choosing a white person and having the witness incorrectly identify them as black. This probability is the error rate of the witness, which we calculated to be 10%.

So, the probability of the witness making a false positive is 0.10 * 0.85 = 0.085 (8.5%).

The probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified them as such, is therefore the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness making a false positive:

0.80 (probability of witness correctly identifying black person) + 0.085 (probability of witness making false positive) = 0.885

So, given the information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 88.5%.
