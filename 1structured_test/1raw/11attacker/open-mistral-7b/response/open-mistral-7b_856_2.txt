To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In this case, when the witness identifies the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that the attacker is indeed black (true positive). On the other hand, when the witness mistakenly identifies someone as black (false positive), the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a false positive is the product of the witness's error rate and the proportion of white people in the city:

False Positive Probability = Error Rate * Proportion of White People
                                          = 0.2 * 0.85
                                          = 0.17

Now we can compute the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement by considering both true positives and false positives:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Statement) = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)
                                                                = (0.8 * Proportion of Black People) / (0.8 * Proportion of Black People + 0.17)

We can substitute the given proportions of black and white people into the equation:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17)
                                                                = 0.12 / 0.186
                                                                â‰ˆ 0.64

So, based on the witness's statement and the racial distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.64 or 64%.
