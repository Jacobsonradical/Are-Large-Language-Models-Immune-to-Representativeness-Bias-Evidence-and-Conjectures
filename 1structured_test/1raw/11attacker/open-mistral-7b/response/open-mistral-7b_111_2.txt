Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black and a white person as black:
- Probability of witness identifying a black person correctly = 0.8 (since the witness gets it right 80% of the time)
- Probability of witness identifying a white person as black = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and 15% of the population is black)

Now let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as white and a white person as white:
- Probability of witness identifying a black person as white = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% of the population is white)
- Probability of witness identifying a white person as white = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 (since the witness gets it right 80% of the time and 85% of the population is white)

To find the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as white, given that they reported a black attacker:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness identifying a black person correctly * Probability of witness reporting a black attacker given that the attacker is black + Probability of witness identifying a black person as white * Probability of witness reporting a black attacker given that the attacker is white

Probability of witness reporting a black attacker given that the attacker is black = 1
Probability of witness reporting a black attacker given that the attacker is white = 0

Using the given probabilities and equations:

Probability of attacker being black = 0.8 * 1 + 0.03 * 0 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
