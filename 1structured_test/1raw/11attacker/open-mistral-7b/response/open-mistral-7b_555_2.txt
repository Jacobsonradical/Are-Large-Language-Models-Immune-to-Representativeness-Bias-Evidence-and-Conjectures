To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white:

1. If the attacker is black:
   - Probability of witness erring = 20%

2. If the attacker is white:
   - Probability of witness erring = Witness mistakes a white person for black = 20% (error rate) * (1 - 0.85) (probability of a person being white) = 0.034

Now, let's assume that the victim reported that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the times when the attacker is black, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is:

{probability: 0.8}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).
