Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, with an error rate of 20%

The prior probability of H (P(H)) is given in the first piece of information: P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The conditional probability of E given H (P(E|H)) is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person, which is 0.8 (80%). The conditional probability of E given not-H (P(E|not-H)) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Solving the equation, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.304

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.304 or 30.4%.
