To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to take into account the information given about the city's population and the witness's reliability.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, we know that the witness is not always reliable. In 20% of the cases, the witness makes an error in identifying a person's race.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:
1) The attacker is actually black and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2) The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race.

Since we don't have any additional information to favor one possibility over the other, we can assume that both possibilities are equally likely.

The probability of the first possibility is the probability of the city's black population, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

The probability of the second possibility is the probability that the attacker is white and the witness makes an error in identifying the attacker's race. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and the population is 85% white, the probability of this second possibility is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, since we have assumed that both possibilities are equally likely, we can consider the opposite of the second possibility: the probability that the attacker is white and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race. This probability is also 0.17 (or 17%).

Since we have assumed that both possibilities are equally likely, the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the probability that the attacker is white and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race. This probability is 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.17}.
