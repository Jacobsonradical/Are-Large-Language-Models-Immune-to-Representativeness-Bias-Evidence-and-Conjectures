The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't know yet, but we'll estimate it based on the city's demographics);
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are black (witness's accuracy);
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black (witness's error rate);
- P(not A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (which can be calculated as 1 - P(A)).

We're given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|not A) = 0.2. We're also given that 85% of the population is white, or P(not A) = 0.85.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Since we don't know P(A), we can't provide a specific number. However, we can rearrange the equation to solve for P(A) in terms of P(A|B):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A|B)] / P(B)

Given that P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85, we can find an expression for P(A) in terms of P(A|B) and then use it to calculate P(A|B).

Unfortunately, without knowing the specific values of P(A|B) and P(B), I can't provide a numerical estimate. You would need additional information or context to make a more precise calculation.
