Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The statistical distribution of races in the city, as given in part "a" (85% white, 15% black).
2. The reliability of the witness's racial identification, as given in part "b" (correctly identifies race 80% of the time, errors 20% of the time).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black introduces a new piece of information. However, due to the uncertainty in the witness's reliability and the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot ignore the population distribution in our estimation.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental principle in probability theory, particularly when dealing with conditional probabilities. It allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness stating that the attacker is black.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need three pieces of information:

1. P(A), the probability of the attacker being black given the city's racial distribution, which is 15% (0.15)
2. P(B|A), the likelihood of the witness stating that the attacker is black given that the attacker is indeed black. According to the witness's statistics, this is 80% (0.8)
3. P(B), the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct (when the attacker is black) and the probability of the witness being wrong (when the attacker is white). Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of being wrong is 20% (0.2). Since the city is 85% white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85, and given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.14

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 14%. It is important to note that this estimate is subject to the reliability of the witness's observation and the statistical distribution of races in the city. If the witness was more reliable or if the racial distribution in the city was different, the probability could change.
