Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's observations are independent events, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is the error rate, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 1 - the error rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

However, we also have information about the racial distribution in the city. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race, the probability of the attacker being black in the city should be considered. According to the information, 15% of the population in the city is black.

Now, we need to combine these two probabilities to find an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. Since the witness's observation is independent of the racial distribution in the city, we can multiply the two probabilities.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) * 0.15 (population percentage of black people), which equals to 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
