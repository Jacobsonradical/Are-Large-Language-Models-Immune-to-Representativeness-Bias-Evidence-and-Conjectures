To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution in the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness made an error by identifying the attacker as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white, and the attack occurred at night, it could be inferred that the witness was more likely to mistake a white person for a black one due to poor lighting conditions.

Therefore, if we assume that the witness's error rate applies equally to both races (which is not necessarily the case, but it's a simplifying assumption), the probability that the witness was incorrect in identifying the attacker as black would be 20%.

But since the witness made an error, the true probability that the attacker is black is the complement of this probability: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, this assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which is likely not the case. The witness's bias or the lighting conditions could have influenced the error. Without more information, it's difficult to adjust this probability.

So, based on the given information and the simplifying assumption, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 (or 80%). But this estimate should be treated with caution due to the simplifying assumptions and potential biases in the witness's observations.
