Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that a witness identified the attacker as black.
3. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% under similar conditions, and they make an error 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't directly use the population statistics since the witness may have made an error. However, we can use the witness's reliability to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

The witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, and incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time. Since we don't know the attacker's race for certain, we need to consider both possibilities.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker is black
- q as the probability that the attacker is white

The witness's accuracy in identifying the attacker as black can be represented as 0.8p + 0.2q. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set this equal to 1:

0.8p + 0.2q = 1

Now, let's solve for p:

0.8p = 0.8
p = 1

However, this is not a valid probability, as it exceeds 1. This means that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not consistent with our initial population statistics.

Since the witness's identification contradicts the population statistics, it's reasonable to assume that the witness may have made an error. In this case, we should consider the possibility that the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identified them as black.

If the witness's error rate of 20% applies to this case, then the probability that the attacker is actually white is 0.2q. We know that q + p = 1, since the attacker must be either white or black. Substituting the value of p from the previous equation, we get:

0.2q + 0.8p = 1
0.2q + 0.8(1) = 1
0.2q = 0.2
q = 0.1

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.8, or 80%. However, considering the possibility of the witness's error, the estimate should be lower. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the estimate should be reduced by this error rate, giving us an estimate of 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.64} is our estimate, taking into account the witness's reliability and the possibility of error.
