Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black would be as follows:

The population statistics give us a baseline probability of 15% for the attacker being black. However, a witness has reported seeing the attacker as black, and their accuracy in identifying race is 80% when presented with equally mixed racial groups.

Given this, the corrected probability estimate would be the sum of the baseline probability and the product of the witness's error rate and the baseline probability, subtracted from 1 (to account for the possibility that the witness is correct).

Here's the calculation:

Baseline probability (p_0) = 0.15 (15%)
Witness error rate (p_e) = 0.2 (20%)

Corrected probability (p_c) = p_0 + p_e * p_0
p_c = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15
p_c = 0.15 + 0.0225
p_c = 0.1725

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report and their known error rate, is approximately 17.25%.
