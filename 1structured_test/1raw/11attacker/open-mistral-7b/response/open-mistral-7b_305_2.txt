Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E), where P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(E|H) is the likelihood of E given H, and P(E) is the total probability of E.

In this case, H is the attacker being black and E is the witness's identification. The prior probability P(H) is the proportion of blacks in the population, which is 15%. The likelihood P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 80%. The total probability P(E) is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 1 - P(correctly identifying a white person as white) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.68.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
     = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.68
     = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the witness's identification, likely due to the witness's error rate and the fact that the majority of the population is white. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and actual events may deviate from these probabilities.
