Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence to consider: the racial composition of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% accuracy, meaning the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.

However, we must note that the witness in this case mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness's error rate of 20% applies to times when the attacker was actually white.

Since we know that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's error rate is 85% - 20% * 85% = 0.7335 (or 73.35%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this must correspond to one of the 20% of the times when the witness makes an error. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's error, is the witness's error rate of 20%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 (or 20%). This means that, according to the witness's identification and considering the racial composition of the city, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is black. However, this estimate should be interpreted with caution, as it relies on the witness's ability to judge race, which may not be perfect or representative of the entire population.
