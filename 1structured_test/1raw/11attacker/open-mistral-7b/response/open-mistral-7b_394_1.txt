To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as correcting the race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. This means the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (80%).

Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85 and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

However, due to the witness's error, if the attacker is indeed black, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as white. This means that in this specific case, we should consider the probability of the attacker being black to be less than the actual 15% in the population.

Given these probabilities, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as follows:

Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker = Probability of black attacker * Probability of witness correctly identifying black person
                                                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                       = 0.12

Since the witness might have mistakenly identified a white attacker as black, we need to account for this error. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white attacker as black = Probability of white attacker * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying black person
                                                                                        = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                                        = 0.17

So, the probability of the attacker being black, considering the witness's error, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black:

Probability of attacker being black = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                = 0.29

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
