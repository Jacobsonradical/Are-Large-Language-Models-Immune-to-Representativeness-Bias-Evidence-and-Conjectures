To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W). We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1.

The witness's identification was that the attacker is black. Given that the attacker is actually black (event B), the probability that the witness correctly identifies this is 0.8 (from information b). Similarly, given that the attacker is white (event W), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies this as black is 0.2 (also from information b).

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black is the sum of these two probabilities:

0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * P(W) = observed probability of witness's identification

We also know that the total population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, so P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15. Substituting these values into the equation:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * P(W) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

However, this is not the observed probability of the witness's identification (which is 1 in this case, since the witness identified the attacker as black). This means that our initial assumption that the attacker is actually black with probability 0.15 is incorrect.

Instead, let's assume that the attacker is white with probability P(B)' = x, and the attacker is black with probability P(W)' = 1 - x. We will solve for x to find the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black is:

0.2 * P(W)' + 0.8 * P(B)' = 0.12 + 0.8 * x

Now we can set this equal to the observed probability of the witness's identification (1):

0.12 + 0.8 * x = 1

Solving for x:

x = (1 - 0.12) / 0.8 = 0.88

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is P(B)' = 0.88, or approximately 88%. However, this value exceeds the actual percentage of black people in the city. This suggests that the witness's identification is unreliable or that the attacker's race was misrepresented in the initial information. It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on this information.
