Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race, then the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using the witness's error rate.

The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black, when the attacker is actually white, is the error rate of 20%. Given that 85% of the population is white, the number of white people in the sample is 0.85 * total population. Therefore, the number of white people the witness incorrectly identifies as black is 0.2 * 0.85 * total population.

The number of black people in the city is 15% of the total population. The number of black people the witness correctly identifies is 0.8 * 0.15 * total population.

The total number of people the witness identifies as black is the sum of the correct identifications and the incorrect identifications.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is the number of correct black identifications divided by the total number of people the witness identifies as black.

Therefore, {probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85), probability: 0.136} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.
