Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person.

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies a black person.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person given that the attacker is black. This is given as 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies a black person as black).
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a black person, which is 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).
P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identifies a black person. This is what we want to find.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Rearranging the terms, we get:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know the value of P(B|A), P(A), and P(B). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(A) = (1) * P(A) / (0.8)

Multiplying both sides by 0.8, we get:

P(A) = P(A) / 0.8

Now, we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = 0.15 (since the city's population is 15% black)

However, we made an error in our initial calculation of P(B|A). In reality, P(B|A) should be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person given that the attacker is black, which is 1. But since the witness also errs 20% of the time, the actual probability of the witness identifying a black person given that the attacker is black is (1 - 0.2) = 0.8, not 1.

To account for this error, we should use the actual probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person given that the attacker is black, which is 0.8, in our calculation of P(A).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}

This means that, based on the witness's identification and the given information about the witness's accuracy and the city's population, there is an 80% probability that the attacker is black.
