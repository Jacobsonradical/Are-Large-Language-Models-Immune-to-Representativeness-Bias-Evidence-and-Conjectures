Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race: They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
2. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.

However, without knowing the specific context of the witness's identification, we cannot directly apply the probability of the witness's accuracy to the actual population distribution. The witness's identification could be influenced by various factors, such as lighting, distance, or personal biases.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict numerical estimate based solely on the given information. A more accurate estimate would require additional data or information about the reliability of the witness's identification in this specific case.
