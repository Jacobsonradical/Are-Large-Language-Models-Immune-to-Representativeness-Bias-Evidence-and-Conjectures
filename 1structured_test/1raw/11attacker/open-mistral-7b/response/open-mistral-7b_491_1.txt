To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker is indeed black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies this is 0.8 (80%). If the attacker is white, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies this as black is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The total probability that the witness makes an error, regardless of the attacker's race, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.21 (21%).

Since there are two possible error types (mistakenly identifying a black person as white and mistakenly identifying a white person as black), the probability of a correct identification by the witness is 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 (79%).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness's ID) = [P(witness's ID | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness's ID)]

Let's calculate the probabilities:

P(witness's ID | attacker is black) = 0.8
P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (from the city's racial distribution)
P(witness's ID) = P(witness's ID | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's ID | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)
                         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                         = 0.12 + 0.17
                         = 0.29

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | witness's ID) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.516 (51.6%)

So, given the witness's identification and considering the reliability of the witness's racial identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 51.6%.
