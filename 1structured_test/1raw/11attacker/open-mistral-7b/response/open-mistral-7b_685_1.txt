To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is higher or lower for black individuals compared to white individuals. If the error rate is the same for both races, then the witness's identification of the attacker as black would have a probability of 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate) given that the attacker is black.

However, if the error rate is higher for black individuals, then the probability that the witness's identification is correct could be lower than 0.8. Conversely, if the error rate is higher for white individuals, then the probability could be higher than 0.8. Without more information, we cannot make a precise estimate.

Given the information provided, we can make a conservative estimate based on the racial distribution of the city's population. Since 85% of the population is white, the attacker is more likely to be white. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is less than 0.15 (15%), the racial distribution of the city's black population.

However, considering the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we should adjust this estimate upwards. A straight probability calculation would give us 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. But the witness's error rate is 20%, so there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error, and if the witness did make an error, the attacker is actually white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is likely higher than 12%.

But without more information, we cannot provide a specific number. Therefore, the best estimate we can provide, given the information provided, is that the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 0.12 (12%) and less than 0.15 (15%), the racial distribution of the city's black population.
