Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down these probabilities:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15

2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would correctly identify a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8

3. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black. Since there is no information about this probability, we can assume it to be equal to the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2.

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness's identification. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

   P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

   P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / [(0.12 + 0.17)]
       = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the witness's identification and the prior probability of the attacker's race, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
