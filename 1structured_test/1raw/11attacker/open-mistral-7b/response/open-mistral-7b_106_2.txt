Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the population composition: P(A) = 0.15
- P(B) is the probability of observing the witness's statement (that the attacker is black), given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the attacker is black, the probability is 0.8.
- P(B|A') is the probability of observing the witness's statement, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, and the attacker is white, the probability is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85)
          = 0.12 / 0.122
          = 0.9826

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.9826 or 98.26%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, which may not always be the case.
