Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when they were correct, and erred 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that relates conditional probability to the prior probability of an event. In this case, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement and the population statistics.

Let's define our variables:

- E: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(E): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(W|E): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|~E): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~E): The probability that the attacker is not black

From the information given in the problem, we can calculate the following probabilities:

- P(E) = 15% (from (b))
- P(~E) = 1 - P(E) = 85% (from (b))

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect. In other words, P(W|E) = 0.8 and P(W|~E) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / [P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|~E) * P(~E)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(E|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us a probability of:

{probability: 0.24, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, based on the witness's statement and the population statistics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24%.
