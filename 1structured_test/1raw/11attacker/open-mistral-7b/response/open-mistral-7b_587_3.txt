Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the population demographics.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. However, we don't know how many times they misidentified a white person as black and vice versa. Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the witness's errors are distributed evenly between the two races. This means that for every 4 correct identifications, they make 1 error.

If 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, then the ratio of white to black people in the city is 85:15. Since the witness identifies correctly 80% of the time, we can assume that in the 20% of cases where they make an error, they are more likely to mistake a black person for a white person than the other way around, given the population ratio.

The probability of a white person being mistaken for black is 15/100 or 0.15. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the number of times they make this mistake is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Given that the victim's attacker could be either race, the total number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is 0.03 (mistakes) + 0.12 (correct identifications) = 0.15.

The total number of times the witness makes a judgment is the sum of correct and incorrect identifications, which is 1 (always making a judgment).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is the ratio of the number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person to the total number of times they make a judgment.
