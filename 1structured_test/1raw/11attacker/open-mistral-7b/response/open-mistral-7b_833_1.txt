Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black. The prior probability of this hypothesis, before considering the witness's testimony, is given by the racial demographics of the city: 15% black and 85% white.

The new evidence is the witness's testimony, which identifies the attacker as black. However, we know that this witness is not infallible and makes errors 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct when they identify a black person is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that they are incorrect is 0.2 (20%).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the likelihood of the attacker being black based on the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Testimony) = [P(Witness Testimony | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Testimony | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Testimony | Attacker is Not Black) * P(Attacker is Not Black)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Testimony) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Testimony) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So, based on the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, our updated estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
