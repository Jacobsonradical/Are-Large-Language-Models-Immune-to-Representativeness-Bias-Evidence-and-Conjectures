Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The overall population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not infallible in identifying races, correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness made a mistake and identified the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white:

Error rate = 20%
White population = 85%

Probability of witness's error = Error rate * White population
                                         = 0.2 * 0.85
                                         = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is equal to the complement of the probability of the witness's error:

Probability of attacker being black = 1 - Probability of witness's error
                                                   = 1 - 0.17
                                                   = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83. This means that there is an 83% chance that the attacker is black based on the given information.
