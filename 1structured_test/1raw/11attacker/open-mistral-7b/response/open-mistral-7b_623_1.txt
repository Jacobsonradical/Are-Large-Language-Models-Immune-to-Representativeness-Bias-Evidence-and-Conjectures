Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The attacker's race is unknown, but the witness identified the attacker as black.

The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The probability of A (the attacker being black) is 15% (from the population information).

The probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's accuracy of 80%.

The probability of B (the witness identifying anyone as black) is the sum of the probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) and the probability of B given not A (the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black).

The probability of B given not A is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 20%.

So, the probability of B is 80% (probability of B given A) + 20% (probability of B given not A) = 100% * 0.8 (probability of A) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) / 100% = 0.128.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12.8%. However, this is likely an underestimate due to the fact that the witness's ability to identify race might be lower in high-stress, low-light situations, and the attacker might have been wearing clothing that obscured their race. Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be closer to the 15% population rate.

{probability: 0.128, please note this is an approximation and a more conservative estimate would be closer to 0.15}
