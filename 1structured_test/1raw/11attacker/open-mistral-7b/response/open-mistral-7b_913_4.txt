To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's racial identification accuracy is 80% for a 50-50 white/black population. This means that if the attacker were actually white, the witness would mistakenly identify him as black 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. The probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white attacker as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this event must be one of the two possibilities:
1) The attacker is actually black, with a probability of 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).
2) The witness made a mistake and the attacker is actually white, with a probability of 0.17.

However, we are given additional information that the witness's ability to judge race is 80% accurate for a 50-50 population. This suggests that the witness's mistake rate might be higher in a city with a more imbalanced racial demographic. To account for this, let's adjust the probability of error upwards.

Let's assume that the witness's error rate in this city is 25% instead of 20%. This would mean a 75% chance of correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that he is black. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black would be 0.25 * 0.15 = 0.0375 (3.75%).

With an 85% white population, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.0375 * 0.85 = 0.032375 (3.24%).

Given the witness's identification, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black attacker and the probabilities of her incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black, both weighted by their respective probabilities:

0.83 (the witness correctly identifying a black attacker) * 0.85 (probability of an attacker being white) + 0.032375 (the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black) * 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black) = 0.704125 (70.41%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.7041 or 70.41%. This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is higher in a city with an imbalanced racial demographic.
