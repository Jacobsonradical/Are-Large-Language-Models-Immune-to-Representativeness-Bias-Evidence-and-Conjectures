To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E | H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. According to the information given, this probability is 0.8 (or 80%).

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence. Given that we don't have any prior information, we can assume this probability to be equal to the proportion of blacks in the population. According to the information given, this is 0.15 (or 15%).

3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the probability that the witness would identify someone as black, regardless of whether they are actually black or not. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the probability of a correct identification and the probability of an error. Given that the witness gets it right 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, this probability is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

4. P(H | E) is the probability we're trying to find.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29

The estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.27, or 27%.
