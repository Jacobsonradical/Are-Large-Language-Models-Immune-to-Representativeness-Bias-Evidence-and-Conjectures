To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

The witness's accuracy in identifying black people is given as 0.8, and the prior probability of the attacker being black is determined by the population distribution. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is black.

Now let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)

P(E | not H) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E | not H) = 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker not being black is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.44

The estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.44.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.44}
