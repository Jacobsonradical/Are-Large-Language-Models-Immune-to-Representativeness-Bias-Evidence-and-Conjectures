To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is equally likely to be either misidentifying a black person as white or misidentifying a white person as black, then the probability of a correct identification is 1 - error rate = 0.8.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, we need to account for the possibility that the witness actually saw a white person and misidentified them. The probability of this happening is the error rate of 0.2.

So the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's mistake, is the error rate times the proportion of whites in the city: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we are looking for the probability of the attacker being black, we can find this by subtracting the probability of the attacker being white from 1: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
