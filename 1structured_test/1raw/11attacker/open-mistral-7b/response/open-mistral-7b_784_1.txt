Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given P(E|H) (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people), P(H) (the proportion of black people in the city), and P(E) (the overall probability of the evidence).

We need to calculate P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

First, let's calculate P(E|H), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H), which is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.

Then, let's calculate P(E), which is the overall probability of the witness's identification. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
