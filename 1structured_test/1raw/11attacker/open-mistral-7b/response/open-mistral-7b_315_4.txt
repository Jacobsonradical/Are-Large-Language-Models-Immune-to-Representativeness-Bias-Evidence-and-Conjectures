Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who has an accuracy of 80% in identifying races, misidentified the attacker as black.

Given these facts, we cannot directly infer that the attacker is black with certainty. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's misidentification.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness misidentified the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (given in the first piece of information).
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness misidentifying a black person as white, which is 20% (since the witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying races).
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness misidentifying any person as black, which can be calculated as the sum of the probability of misidentifying a white person as black (20% of the 85% white population) and the probability of misidentifying a black person as black (0% error rate, but since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this event does not contribute to P(B)). So, P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0 * 0.15 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.235

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's misidentification, is approximately 23.5%.
