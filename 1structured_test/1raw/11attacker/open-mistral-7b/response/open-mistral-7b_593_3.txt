Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that this identification was correct.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is actually R (either black or white). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that they make an error is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%). Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black given this identification is the probability of the witness making a correct identification divided by the probability of the attacker being black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 / 0.015 = 0.8 (80%). However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is perfectly accurate in this situation, which is not guaranteed by the information provided. Therefore, the actual probability may be lower.

In summary, based on the given information, it seems likely that the attacker is black (80% probability), but this estimate is uncertain due to the limitations of the witness's ability to accurately identify race in low-light conditions.
