To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (true positive) and the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black (false positive).

The probability of a true positive (P(TP)) is the proportion of black people in the city times the witness's correct identification rate for black people:

P(TP) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

The probability of a false positive (P(FP)) is the proportion of white people in the city times the witness's error rate for black people:

P(FP) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the probability of a true positive (the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him/her as black) and the probability of a false positive (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, leading to the incorrect conclusion that the attacker is black).

The probability that the attacker is black (P(A = black)) is the sum of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false positive, divided by the sum of the probabilities of both possibilities:

P(A = black) = (P(TP) + P(FP)) / (P(TP) + P(FP) + P(TN) + P(FN))

Where P(TN) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white (true negative), and P(FN) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white (false negative).

Since we don't have information about P(TN) and P(FN), we cannot calculate an exact value for P(A = black). However, we can still provide an upper bound for the probability that the attacker is black.

To do this, we will assume that the witness never mistakes a white person for a black one (i.e., P(FP) = 0). Under this assumption, the probability of a false positive becomes 0, and the probability of a true positive remains the same:

P(TP) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

The probability that the attacker is black under this assumption would be:

P(A = black) = P(TP) / (P(TP) + P(TN) + P(FN))

Given that P(TN) + P(FN) = 1 - P(TP), we can rewrite the equation as:

P(A = black) = P(TP) / (1 - P(TP))

Substituting the value for P(TP) from above, we get:

P(A = black) = 0.12 / (1 - 0.12) = 0.12 / 0.88 â‰ˆ 0.136

So, under the assumption that the witness never mistakes a white person for a black one, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.136 or 13.6%. However, this is an upper bound, and the actual probability is likely lower due to the presence of false positives. It's essential to note that this calculation relies on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be significantly different.
