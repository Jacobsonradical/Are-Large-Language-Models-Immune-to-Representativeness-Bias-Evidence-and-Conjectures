To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can treat each guess as a binary classification problem with two possible outcomes: correct or incorrect.

In this case, the true probability of the attacker being black is P(black) = 0.15 (as given in the city's racial composition). The probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly is P(witness correct | black) = 0.8.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness identifying a white person incorrectly as black is P(witness incorrect | white) = 0.2 (since the witness gets it right 80% of the time). The probability of the witness identifying a white person correctly is P(witness correct | white) = 0.8.

Since the overall error rate is 20%, the probability of the witness identifying a black person incorrectly is P(witness incorrect | black) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(black | witness black) = P(witness black | black) * P(black) / [P(witness black | black) * P(black) + P(witness black | not black) * P(not black)]

Substituting the values:

P(black | witness black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(black | witness black) â‰ˆ 0.39

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.39.
