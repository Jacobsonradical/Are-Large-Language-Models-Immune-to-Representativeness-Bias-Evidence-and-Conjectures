Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (called the likelihood)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (sum of probabilities of all hypotheses given the evidence)

Given that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%, we can calculate P(E|H) as 0.8 (probability of correct identification) and P(not E|H) as 0.2 (probability of error).

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15%, or 0.15.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black and vice versa can be assumed to be equal due to the balanced population (85% white and 15% black). Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2. So, P(not E|not H) = 0.2.

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, so P(E|not H) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2, so P(not E|H) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Now, we can calculate P(E) as the sum of P(E|H) and P(not E|not H):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(not E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.0267
P(E) = 0.1467

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1467
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1921

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.1921 or 19.21%.
