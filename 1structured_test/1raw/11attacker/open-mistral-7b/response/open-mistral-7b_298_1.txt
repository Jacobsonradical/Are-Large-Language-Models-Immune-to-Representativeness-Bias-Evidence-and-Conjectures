Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct identification and 20% error. However, since we don't know if the error was in favor of identifying the attacker as black or white, we need to consider both possibilities.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We also know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 1 - P(black) = 0.85.

Given the witness's reliability, if the attacker is black, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness will correctly identify the attacker as black. In contrast, if the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as black 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 times, or 17% of the time.

So, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.17. To find the probability that the witness actually identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both the correct identification and the error:

P(witness said black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness mistakenly identifies white as black)

Plugging in the numbers:

P(witness said black) = P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.17

Since we're trying to find P(black), we can rewrite this as:

P(black) = (P(witness said black) - P(white) * 0.17) / 0.8

Using the information that 85% of the population is white, P(white) = 0.85. Plugging this into the equation:

P(black) = (P(witness said black) - 0.85 * 0.17) / 0.8

Finally, we need to know P(witness said black), which is not provided in the information. However, without this information, we cannot provide a definitive probability estimate.
