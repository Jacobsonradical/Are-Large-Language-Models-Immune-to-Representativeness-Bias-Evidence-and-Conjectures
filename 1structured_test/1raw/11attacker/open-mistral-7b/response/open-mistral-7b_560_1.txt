To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, since we don't know if the witness's error was in identifying the attacker as black or white, we can't directly use this percentage to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as the product of the prior probability of event A (P(A)) and the likelihood of event B given event A (P(B|A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black, and P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is the witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 0.8 or 80%.

The probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white (P(B|~A)) is the witness's error rate in identifying race, which is 0.2 or 20%.

The probability of the attacker being black is P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The probability of the witness's statement is P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.667 or 66.7%

So, given the information we have, we estimate that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 66.7%.
