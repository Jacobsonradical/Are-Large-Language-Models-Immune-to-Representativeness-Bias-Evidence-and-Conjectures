Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The demographic distribution of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the initial demographic distribution. To account for this discrepancy, we need to consider the possibility of the witness's error.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, there's a chance that they mistakenly identified the attacker as black despite the city's majority white population. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's report, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case:

1. First, calculate the probability of the attacker being white, given the city's demographics: 0.85 (probability of being white)
2. Then calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white: 0.20 (error rate)
3. Multiply the probabilities from steps 1 and 2 to get the probability of both events happening together: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (approximately 17%)

Since the witness reported the attacker as black, this means that the event of the attacker being black, given the witness's report, is the complementary event to the probability calculated in step 3. To find this probability, subtract the calculated probability from 1:

1. Calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black: 0.80 (accuracy rate)
2. Multiply this probability by the probability of the attacker being black, given the city's demographics (which we do not have specific information about):
   - Since the witness reported the attacker as black, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black is at least as high as the probability calculated in step 3.
   - However, without further information, we cannot accurately calculate this probability.

Therefore, the best estimate we can provide is based on the probability of the witness's error, which is approximately 17%. However, this answer relies on the assumption that the witness's error rate is consistent across different scenarios, which may not always be the case.
