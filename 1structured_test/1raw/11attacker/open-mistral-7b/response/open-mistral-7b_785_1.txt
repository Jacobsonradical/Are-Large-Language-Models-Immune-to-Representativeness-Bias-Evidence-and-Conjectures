Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not always reliable in identifying race correctly identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black could be a correct identification or an error. Since we don't know which it is, we should consider both possibilities and their probabilities.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the true probability of the attacker being black is P, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is P. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black is 1 - P.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white is 0, because the witness always errs in identifying whites as black. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 1.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black and making an error when the attacker is white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is P / (P + 0).

Since the probability of the attacker being black must be between 0 and 1, and the probability of the attacker being white is 1 - P, we can write the equation P + (1 - P) = 1, which simplifies to P = 0.5.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.5} or 50%. However, this estimate should be treated with caution due to the uncertainty in the witness's ability to identify race accurately.
