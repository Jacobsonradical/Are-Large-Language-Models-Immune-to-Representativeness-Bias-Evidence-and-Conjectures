To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some observed evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker being black).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's identification).
- P(H | E) is the posterior probability, which is what we're trying to find.
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

We have the following information:
1. P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
2. P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was white)
3. P(H) = ? (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
4. P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) (the prior probability of the attacker being white)

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can infer that the prior probability P(H) is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we can compute P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) + P(E | ¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.177 = 0.297

Now we can compute the posterior probability P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E)
P(H | E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.297
P(H | E) ≈ 0.438

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.438 or 43.8%.
