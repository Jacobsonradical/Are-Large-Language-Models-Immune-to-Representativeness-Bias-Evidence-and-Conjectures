Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B is proportional to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence B is the witness's identification. The prior probability of A (P(A)) is the proportion of blacks in the population (15%), and the likelihood of B given A (P(B|A)) is the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks (80%). The likelihood of B given not-A (P(B|not-A)) is the witness's error rate in identifying blacks (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

After calculation, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.37 or 37%.
