To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given a 50-50 split of whites and blacks in the sample, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 80% chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed black.

However, the city's population is not 50-50 white and black, but rather 85% white and 15% black (as per information "b"). So, we need to adjust the probability based on this information.

Let's denote W as the probability that the attacker is white and B as the probability that the attacker is black. We know that W + B = 1 (since there are only two possible races).

The witness sees the attacker and makes a judgment. According to their history, there's a 20% chance that they make a mistake, so the probability that they make a correct judgment is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given the racial composition of the city, the probability that the attacker is white (W) is 0.85, and the probability that the attacker is black (B) is 0.15.

The witness sees the attacker and correctly identifies them as black, so the probability of this event is B * (1 - 0.20) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

However, the witness also has a 20% chance of making a mistake, and if they make a mistake, they are more likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black than the other way around. Given the racial composition of the city, the probability of a white person being mistaken for black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, while the probability of a black person being mistaken for white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03.

So, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black is 0.17. The probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a black person as white is 0.03.

The probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is therefore 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20.

Since the witness never reported seeing the attacker as white, we can rule out the possibility of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black. Therefore, the only way the witness's identification could be incorrect is if they made a mistake and identified a black person as white.

The probability of this happening is 0.03.

The probability that the witness's identification is correct is therefore 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.

However, this 0.97 probability is still based on the 50-50 split in the sample, not the actual racial composition of the city. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we need to adjust the probability based on this information.

The probability that the witness makes a correct identification and the attacker is black is B * (1 - 0.20) * 0.97 = 0.15 * 0.80 * 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.1065.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.1065, or 10.65%.
