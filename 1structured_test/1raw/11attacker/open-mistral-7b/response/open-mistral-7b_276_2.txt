Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- δ: the witness's observation, which is that the attacker is black

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(H), is given in the first piece of information: P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).

The likelihood of the witness making an observation of a black attacker given that the attacker is indeed black, P(δ|H), is given in the second piece of information: P(δ|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time).

The likelihood of the witness making an observation of a black attacker given that the attacker is not black, P(δ|~H), is the complement of P(δ|H), since the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is actually white: P(δ|~H) = 0.2.

The probability of the attacker being not black, P(~H), is given by the complement of P(H): P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|δ) = P(δ|H) * P(H) / [P(δ|H) * P(H) + P(δ|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|δ) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|δ) = 0.12 / 0.19 = 0.632

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.632 or 63.2%.
