To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is 80% for correctly identifying race. This means they err 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Given these facts, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black (type I error) and a black person as white (type II error).

The probability of a type I error is the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black, which is the witness's error rate (0.2) multiplied by the probability of a white person being present (0.85).

P(type I error) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The probability of a type II error is the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white, which is the witness's error rate (0.2) multiplied by the probability of a black person being present (0.15).

P(type II error) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (not committing a type II error). This is the probability of a type I error plus the probability of a type II error (both errors happening is unlikely).

P(correct identification) = 1 - P(type I error) - P(type II error)
                                  = 1 - 0.17 - 0.03
                                  = 0.80

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
