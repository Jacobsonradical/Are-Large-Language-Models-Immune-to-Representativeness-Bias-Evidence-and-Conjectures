Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the initial information that the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, it's hard to give a definitive probability based on this contradictory information.

Assuming that the witness's identification is correct despite the victim's statement, we can calculate the probability based on the racial composition and the witness's accuracy.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the number of times the witness correctly identified a black person divided by the total number of times they made an identification.

The total number of times the witness made an identification is not given, but we can calculate it from the given error rate. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, they must be correct 80% of the time. Therefore, for every 5 times the witness makes an identification, they will be correct 4 times and wrong once.

The number of black people in the city is 15% of the total population. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person given that they identified someone is 15/5 = 0.3 or 30%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and assuming that the victim's statement is incorrect, is 0.3 or 30%.

{probability: 0.3, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
