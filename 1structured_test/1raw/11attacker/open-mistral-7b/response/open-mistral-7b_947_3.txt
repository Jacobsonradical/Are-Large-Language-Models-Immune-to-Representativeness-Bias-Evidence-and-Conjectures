Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in statistics and probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to calculate.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2 (20%).
- P(H) + P(~H) = 1, where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

To calculate P(E|H) and P(E|~H), we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's race:
- P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|~H) = 0.2

To calculate P(H), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

To calculate P(~H), we can use the given population data:
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% white population)

Now we can calculate P(H):

P(H) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
     = 0.12 / 0.182
     = 0.6585333333333334

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.66 (66%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.66}
