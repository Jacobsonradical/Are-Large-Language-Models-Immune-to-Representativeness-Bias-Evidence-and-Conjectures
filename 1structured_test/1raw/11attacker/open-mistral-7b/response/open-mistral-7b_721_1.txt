Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that deals with conditional probabilities.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The given information provides us with the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (The probability that the attacker is black, given the population statistics)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is black)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black)
4. P(~A) = 0.85 (The probability that the attacker is not black)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
