Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when they were correct and erred 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to estimate)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the first piece of information: 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (given in the first piece of information: 0.2)
- P(B) as the prior probability of the city having a black attacker (given in the second piece of information: 0.15)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the city having a non-black attacker (given in the second piece of information: 0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(B|W) is given by:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.196

So, given the information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 19.6%.
