Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, and P(A|B) is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which we know is 0.8 (80%).

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which is the sum of the probability that the person is black and the probability that the witness errors and incorrectly identifies a white person as black:

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)

P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white).

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which we know is 0.2 (20%).

So,

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
P(B) = P(A) * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2

Now we can solve for P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / [P(A) * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 22%.
