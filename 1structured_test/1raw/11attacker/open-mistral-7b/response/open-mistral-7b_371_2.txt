Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the population distribution in the city.

However, it's important to note that this situation involves two sources of uncertainty: the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race and the actual race of the attacker, which we don't know.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are randomly distributed across races, and the attacker is either black or white, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 20% (the error rate), and the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 80% (the correct rate).

Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is also 20%.

Given that the witness reports seeing a black person, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person, which is 80%.

However, we also need to consider the distribution of races in the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it's more likely that a random person in the city is white than black.

If we make the assumption that the attacker is equally likely to attack any person in the city (which may not be the case, but it's a simplification we can make for this calculation), then the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness reported seeing a black person, is the product of the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person and the probability of a random person in the city being black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.80) * (0.15) = 0.12, or 12%.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's errors are random and that the attacker is equally likely to attack any person in the city. In reality, these assumptions may not hold, and the true probability could be different.
