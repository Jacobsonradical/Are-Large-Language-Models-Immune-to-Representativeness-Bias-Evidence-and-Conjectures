To solve this problem, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city has an 85% white population and a 15% black population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We can write two equations based on the given information:

1) The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is P(black) * 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying blacks).
2) The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is (1 - P(black)) * 0.15 (since there is a 15% chance of encountering a black person and the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying whites as blacks).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation for the probability of this event:

P(witness correctly identified black) = P(black) * 0.8 = 0.85 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker)

We also know that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is equal to the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white:

P(witness incorrectly identified black | attacker is white) = (1 - P(black)) * 0.15 = 0.85 (since the witness's incorrect identification rate is equal to the probability of the attacker being black)

We can now solve for P(black) by setting these two equations equal to each other and solving for P(black):

P(black) * 0.8 = (1 - P(black)) * 0.15

Now, we can solve for P(black):

P(black) * 0.8 = 0.15 * (1 - P(black))

P(black) * 0.8 = 0.15 - 0.15 * P(black)

0.6 * P(black) = 0.15

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.25 or 25%.
