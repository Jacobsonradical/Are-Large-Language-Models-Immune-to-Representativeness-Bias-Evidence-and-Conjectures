Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race: 80% accuracy and 20% error.

The witness's statement that the attacker was black is not enough information to definitively say that the attacker is black, as we know the witness's error rate is 20%. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement and the racial composition of the city.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (since the attacker is actually black, the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 100% of the time)
- P(B) = P(witness statement that the attacker is black) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, we can assume that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% of the time). So, P(B) = 0.1 * 1 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.33 (33%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (1 * 0.15) / 0.33
      = 0.4545

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 45.45%. This means that, given the information available, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black, but there is still a significant chance that the attacker is white.
