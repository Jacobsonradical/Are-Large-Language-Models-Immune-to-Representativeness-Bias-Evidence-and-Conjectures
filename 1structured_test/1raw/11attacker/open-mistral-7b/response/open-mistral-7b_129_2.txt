Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(H) (prior probability): Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can say that the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

2. P(E|H) (probability of witness's identification given the attacker is black): The witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Since the witness saw the attacker in conditions similar to that night, we can assume that the probability of correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person is 0.2. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(H|E) (probability of attacker being black given the witness's identification): This is what we want to find out.

4. P(E) (probability of the witness's identification): Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person 20% of the time and correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, the overall probability of the witness's identification is 0.8 * 0.15 (probability of a black person) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of a white person) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
