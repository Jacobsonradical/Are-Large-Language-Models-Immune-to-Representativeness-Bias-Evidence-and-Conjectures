To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the overall racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identifications.

From the given information, we know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% in similar conditions, with an error rate of 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability of this happening if the attacker was indeed black. Given that the witness's correct identification rate is 80%, the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white attacker as black. The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability of making such a mistake is 0.2.

Since the witness's identification is the only evidence we have, we should consider both the probability of a correct identification and the probability of an error. To do this, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (0.8) divided by the sum of this probability and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker (0.2).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1.0 = 0.8}

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the given information, is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
