Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, where they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black conflicts with the city's racial composition. This discrepancy raises questions about the reliability of the witness's testimony, especially given that they identified the race in a dark environment.

To provide a strict probability estimate, we can consider the two possibilities:

a) The witness is mistaken, and the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability of this happening would be the probability of the witness making a mistake when identifying a white person. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability would be 0.2.

b) The witness is correct, and the attacker is black. In this case, the probability of this happening would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability would be 0.8.

Since we cannot definitively determine which of these two possibilities is more likely, a strict probability estimate would be a weighted average of these two probabilities. However, given the inconsistency between the witness's testimony and the city's racial demographics, it might be more reasonable to consider the witness's identification as less reliable, and therefore lean towards the first possibility.

In conclusion, while a strict probability estimate would require more information, considering the potential unreliability of the witness's testimony, it might be reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker is black to be less than 85%, the city's white population percentage. However, without more information, a definitive estimate cannot be provided.
