Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a way of updating the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time), P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white), and P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making this specific mistake, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white)

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.833

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.833 or 83.3%.
