Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

The city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect. They correctly identify race 80% of the time but err 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. But due to the witness's error rate, we cannot be 100% certain that their identification is correct. We need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black is P(black). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is (1-P(white)) * 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race).

Given the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is:

P(black | witness) = P(witness | black) * P(black) / [P(witness | black) * P(black) + P(witness | not black) * P(not black)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(black | witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black of approximately 0.21 or 21%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.21}
