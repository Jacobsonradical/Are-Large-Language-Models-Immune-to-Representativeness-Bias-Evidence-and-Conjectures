Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is relatively accurate in identifying races but makes errors 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There is a chance that the witness made an error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a white person as black and the probability of the attacker actually being black.

If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying him as black is 0.20 (based on information b). The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (based on information a).

So the probability of the witness making an error in this case is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%)

However, if the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as black is 0.80 (based on information b). The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (based on information a).

So the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker in this case is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%)

The total probability of the witness's identification is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.17 (erroneous identification of a white person) + 0.12 (correct identification of a black person) = 0.29 (or 29%)

However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. This is the inverse probability:

The probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black, divided by the total probability of the witness's identification.

Given that the attacker is black, the probability of the witness's identification is 0.12 (as calculated above). The total probability of the witness's identification is 0.29 (as calculated above).

So the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (or 41%)

Therefore, given the information provided, it is estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.41.
