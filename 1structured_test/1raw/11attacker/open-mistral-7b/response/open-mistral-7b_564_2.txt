To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given about the city's population and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness, in conditions similar to the night of the attack, was able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and made errors 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot assume that the witness's identification is always correct, especially given that the witness's reliability is only 80%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem for this problem is:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identified as Black) = [P(Witness Identified as Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Identified as Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identified as Black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

We have the following probabilities:

1. P(Witness Identified as Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
2. P(Witness Identified as Black | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (the witness made an error 20% of the time)
3. P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (from the city's demographic information)
4. P(Attacker is White) = 0.85 (from the city's demographic information)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identified as Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identified as Black) = 0.12 / 0.14

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identified as Black) â‰ˆ 0.8571

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.8571 or 85.71%. This estimate takes into account both the city's demographic information and the witness's reliability in identifying race. However, it is essential to note that this estimate is not definitive and may vary based on different assumptions.
