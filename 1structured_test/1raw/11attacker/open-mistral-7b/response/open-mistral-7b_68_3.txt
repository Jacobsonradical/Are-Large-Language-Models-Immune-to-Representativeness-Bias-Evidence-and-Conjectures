To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the race distribution in the sample used to assess the witness's ability is the same as the racial demographics in the city (as it was not specified otherwise), then the witness's error rate of 20% can be interpreted as an error rate for both white and black people.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. The witness will correctly identify a white person 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify a white person 20% of the time.

Similarly, given that 15% of the population in the city is black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. The witness will correctly identify a black person 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify a black person 20% of the time.

The witness's testimony that the attacker is black means that the witness either correctly identified a black person or incorrectly identified a white person. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Therefore, the total probability of the witness's testimony being correct (either correctly identifying a black person or incorrectly identifying a white person) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Since the witness's testimony is the only information we have, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29.
