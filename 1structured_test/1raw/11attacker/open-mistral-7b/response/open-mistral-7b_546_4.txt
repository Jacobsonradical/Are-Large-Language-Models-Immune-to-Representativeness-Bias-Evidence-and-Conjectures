Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness who is generally correct in identifying race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as black.

Since the witness's identification is not necessarily accurate, we need to consider the possibility of a false positive (identifying a white person as black) and a false negative (identifying a black person as white).

Let's denote:
- P(White) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(Black) as the probability that the attacker is black

We know that P(White) + P(Black) = 1.

From the witness's statements, we can say that the probability of a false positive is P(White) * 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is white), and the probability of a false negative is P(Black) * 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is black).

The witness identified the attacker as black, so the event we are interested in is:

P(Black) * (1 - 0.2) + P(White) * 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

Rearranging the equation, we get:

0.8 = 0.8 * P(Black) + 0.2 * P(White)

Simplifying:

0 = 0.2 * P(White)

However, this equation is not solvable with the given information, as we don't have enough information to determine the exact probability of the attacker being white.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate for the attacker being black. We would need additional information to make a more accurate estimation.

In summary, {probability: Undetermined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
