To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given and make an inferential calculation.

The witness's ability to identify race is not perfect, with an error rate of 20%. However, the attack occurred in the dark, so the witness's judgment might be less reliable than under normal conditions.

Also, we know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. But the fact that the witness identifies people's races correctly 80% of the time suggests that they might have a slight bias towards identifying people as white, given that whites make up a larger portion of the population.

Given these considerations, it would be incorrect to simply take the witness's statement at face value and assume that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.8. Instead, we should adjust for the witness's error rate and the population demographics.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as P_B. Then, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black, is P_B. The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (the error rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood ratio is P_B / (0.85*P_B + 0.15*0.2) = P_B / (0.07P_B + 0.003) = P_B / 0.007P_B + 0.0002.

Since the likelihood ratio is greater than 1, this observation is more consistent with the hypothesis that the attacker is black than with the hypothesis that the attacker is white.

However, due to the witness's potential bias and the dark conditions, it would be unreasonable to assign a probability of 1 to the hypothesis that the attacker is black. Instead, a more conservative estimate would be to use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief that the attacker is black, given the new evidence.

The prior probability that the attacker is black, P(B), can be estimated based on the population demographics, which is 0.15. The likelihood of the observation given that the attacker is black, P(W|B), is 0.8. The posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the observation, is P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W), where P(W) is the likelihood of the observation under both hypotheses.

We know that P(W|B) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.15, and P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the error rate). To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B).

Substituting the values, we get P(W) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

The posterior probability of the attacker being black is therefore P(B|W) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is 0.414. This means that, based on the witness's statement and the city's demographics, there is a 41.4% chance that the attacker is black.
