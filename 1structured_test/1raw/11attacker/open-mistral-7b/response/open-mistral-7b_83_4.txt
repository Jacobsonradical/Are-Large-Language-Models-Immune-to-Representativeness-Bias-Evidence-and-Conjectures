The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, in this case, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's error rate to the situation, as we don't know if the witness made an error in this instance.

The best we can do is use the population statistics from the city to make an educated guess. If 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it would seem more likely that the attacker is white. But since the witness identified the attacker as black, we might consider adjusting our estimate to account for the witness's error rate, even if we don't know which error was made in this case.

Given the limited information, a rough estimate could be to add the witness's error rate to the majority population percentage, which is 85%. So, the probability that the attacker is black might be approximately (0.85 + 0.20) * 0.15 = 0.21, or 21%. However, this is a very rough estimate and should not be considered definitive without more information.
