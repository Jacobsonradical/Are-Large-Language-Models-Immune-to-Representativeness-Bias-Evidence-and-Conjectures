To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can treat this as a success in their race identification.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly selected from the city population, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

However, due to the witness's reliability, we need to adjust this probability to account for the fact that the witness might have erroneously identified the attacker as black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually white but the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and the probability of the attacker being white but misidentified: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32 (32%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.32.
