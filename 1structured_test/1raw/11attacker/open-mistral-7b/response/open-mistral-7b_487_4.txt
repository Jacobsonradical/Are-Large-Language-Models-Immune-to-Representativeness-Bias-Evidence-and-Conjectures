To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can't directly apply this information to our probability calculation. Instead, we can compare the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black to the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of randomly selecting a white person is 0.85 and the probability of selecting a black person is 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, the witness errs 20% of the time, and since they identify white people as black more frequently than black people, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is higher than the probability of erring and identifying a black person as black.

To calculate this probability, we can use the complementary probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white, which is 0.8 - 0.8 * 0.80 = 0.16 (16%).

Since the witness mistakenly identifies white people as black more often than black people, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is higher. Let's call this probability x. Since the total probability of the witness erring is 20%, we have the equation 0.16 + x = 0.2. Solving for x, we get x = 0.04 (4%).

Therefore, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 4%, and since this is the opposite error we want to consider, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 (96%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.12 (12%), divided by the total probability of the witness erring or correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.12 + 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.13 (13%).

However, given the information that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it seems more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the attacker is white, it is a more reasonable assumption based on the given information.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 13%, but considering the racial composition of the city, it is more likely that the attacker is white.

{probability: 0.13, please note that while this is the strict mathematical calculation, it seems more likely that the attacker is white given the city's racial composition}
