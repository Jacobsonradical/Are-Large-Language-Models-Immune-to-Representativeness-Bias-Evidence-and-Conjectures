To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black) given the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. This is the probability that a black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness, plus the probability that a black person would be correctly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 0.2. The probability of correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So, P(E|H) = 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.1 = 0.28.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence without considering the hypothesis. This is the probability that any person, regardless of race, would be mistakenly identified as black by the witness, plus the probability that any person would be correctly identified as black by the witness. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of mistakenly identifying any person as black is 0.2. The probability of correctly identifying any person as black is 0.8 * 0.5 (since there is an equal probability of a white or black person being present). So, P(E) = 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.164.

Now we can compute P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.28 * 0.15] / 0.164
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.246

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.246 or 24.6%. This estimate takes into account both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.
