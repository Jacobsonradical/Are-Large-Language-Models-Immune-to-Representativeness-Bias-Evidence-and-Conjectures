To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's ability to identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given that we don't have any additional information about the specific circumstances of the attack or the potential biases of the witness, we can make an assumption that the attacker's race is equally likely to be misidentified as either white or black by the witness. This means that out of the 20% of the time the witness errs, we can assume that half of those errors (10%) are erroneous identifications of a black person as white.

So, out of 100 total people, the witness correctly identifies 80 as their racial group, and erroneously identifies 20 as the other racial group (10 as white and 10 as black).

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is therefore the number of black people the witness correctly identified divided by the total number of black people in the city, plus the number of black people the witness mistakenly identified as being from another race.

Let's calculate this:

Correctly identified black people = 0.8 * 100 = 80
Mistakenly identified black people = 0.1 * 100 = 15

Total black people in the city = 15% * 100 = 15

Probability of the attacker being black = (80 + 15) / 100 = 0.95

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.95 or 95%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race and the city's racial demographics remain consistent, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.
