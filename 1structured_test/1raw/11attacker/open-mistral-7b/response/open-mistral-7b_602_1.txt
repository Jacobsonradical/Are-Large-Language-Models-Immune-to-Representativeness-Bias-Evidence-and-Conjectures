Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's description of the attacker being black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is indeed black. The witness could have made an error. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the population composition.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We also know the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black (P(white|black)) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (P(black|black)).

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white with a probability of 20%, we can calculate P(white|black) as 0.2. Since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8, we can calculate P(black|black) as 0.8.

Given the population composition, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black as P(black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

Now, we have two conditional probabilities:

1. P(witness said black | attacker is black) = P(black|black) = 0.8
2. P(witness said black | attacker is white) = P(white|black) = 0.2

We can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description as:

P(black | witness said black) = [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(black | witness said black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(black | witness said black) = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
