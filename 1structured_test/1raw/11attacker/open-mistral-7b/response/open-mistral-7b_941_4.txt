To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's ability to identify race correctly is 80% (0.8), and they err 20% of the time (0.2).
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that the witness is not always correct, but they are more likely to identify a black person as black than a white person as black (erring in 20% of cases).
2. Given that the city is predominantly white, it's more likely that the attacker is white. However, since the witness errs more often in identifying whites as blacks than blacks as whites, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is more likely to be correct than not.

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8 (eighty percent)}

In this scenario, the witness's error rate does not significantly influence the probability estimate due to the city's racial composition. Since the attacker was more likely to be identified as black by the witness, we can infer a higher probability that the attacker is black.
