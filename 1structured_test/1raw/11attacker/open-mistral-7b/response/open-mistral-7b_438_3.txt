Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not directly applicable to the attacker's race because the attacker was attacked in the dark and the witness did not see the attacker's race. However, we do have information about the racial demographics of the city.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics, would be 15% or 0.15.

However, if we were to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we would need to know how this ability applies to situations where race cannot be visually determined, such as at night. Without this information, we cannot make a reliable estimate.

Therefore, the most conservative estimate based on the available information is 15% or 0.15 that the attacker is black.
