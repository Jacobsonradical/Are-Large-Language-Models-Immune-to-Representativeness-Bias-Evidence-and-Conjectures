Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:
1. The racial demographics of the city (85% white, 15% black).
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race (80% of the time) and the error rate (20% of the time).

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly use the city's demographics. Instead, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races. The witness's error rate is 20%, so when they say the attacker is black, there is a 20% chance that they are incorrect.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, this means they are correct 80% of the time when they identify a black person (given the 80% accuracy rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (the 80% chance they are correct) multiplied by the actual proportion of black people in the city (15%).

So, the probability estimate is: {probability: 0.12, meaning there is a 12% chance that the attacker is actually black if the witness's identification is correct}

But because there is a 20% chance that the witness is wrong, we need to account for this error. To do this, we multiply our probability estimate by the probability that the witness was correct in their identification.

So, the final probability estimate is: {probability: 0.12 * 0.8 = 0.096, meaning there is a 9.6% chance that the attacker is actually black, accounting for the witness's error rate}
