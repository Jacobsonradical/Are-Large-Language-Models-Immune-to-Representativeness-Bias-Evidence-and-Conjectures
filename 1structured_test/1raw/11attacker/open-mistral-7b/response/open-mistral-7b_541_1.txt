Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability of event A (the attacker being black) can be estimated using the population data given in option b. The probability of event B given event A (the witness correctly identifying a black person) is given as 0.8, and the probability of event B given not event A (the witness incorrectly identifying a black person) is given as 0.2.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, and P(B|not A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person. Then, by Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

Since 85% of the population is white, we can infer that 15% is black. So, P(A) = 0.15. Substituting this value, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.347 or 34.7%

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.347 or 34.7%.
