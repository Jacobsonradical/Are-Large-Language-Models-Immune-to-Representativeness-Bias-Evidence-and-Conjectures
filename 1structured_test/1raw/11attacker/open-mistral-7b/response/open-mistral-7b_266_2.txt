To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, regardless of whether the person is actually black or not)

First, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black in the city)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.483

So, based on the witness's statement and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.483, or 48.3%.
