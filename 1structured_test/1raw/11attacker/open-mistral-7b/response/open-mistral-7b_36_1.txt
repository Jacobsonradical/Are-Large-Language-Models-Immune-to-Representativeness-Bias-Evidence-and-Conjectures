To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness made an error in this case (since the victim could not see the attacker's race), then the attacker must be white, given the racial composition of the city (85% white).

However, we know from the witness's reliability that they err 20% of the time. So, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error, and the attacker is actually black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 (or 20%).
