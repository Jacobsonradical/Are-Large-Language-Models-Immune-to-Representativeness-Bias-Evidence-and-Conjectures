Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any information about the actual race of the attacker.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics, which allows us to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We know P(B|A) from the information provided: P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

We also know P(A) from the population statistics: P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

However, we don't have information about P(B), the probability of the witness identifying any person as black. Since the witness makes errors, P(B) is higher than P(A). But we don't have enough information to calculate it precisely.

Therefore, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate based on the given information. However, we can say that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is likely to be higher than 0.15 (15%), but lower than 1.0. The exact value would require more information about the witness's error rate in identifying people of different races.
