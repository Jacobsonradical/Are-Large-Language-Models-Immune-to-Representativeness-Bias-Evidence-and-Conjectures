Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, we can only consider the possibility that the attacker is black based on the witness's incorrect identification rate.

The probability that the witness's incorrect identification is a false positive (the attacker is white but identified as black) is 20% (0.2). Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identified him as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness's correct identification is a true positive (the attacker is black). The probability of this is 15% (0.15).

Since we cannot rule out the possibility that the witness's correct identification is the actual situation, the minimum probability that the attacker is black is 15%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.15} is a strict lower bound for the probability that the attacker is black. However, considering the witness's error rate in identifying race, a more realistic estimate might be closer to the 50-50 proportion of the population, which is 0.5. Therefore, a more educated guess might be {probability: 0.5}.
