To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

First, let's consider the reliability of the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible explanations:

1. The attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the first explanation, P(attacker is black), is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race given that the attacker is black. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person multiplied by the probability that the attacker is black:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)

The probability of the second explanation, P(attacker is white), is the probability that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person multiplied by the probability that the attacker is white:

P(attacker is white) = P(witness incorrectly identifies black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

We are given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as c and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as e. Then, we have:

c = 0.8
e = 0.2

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person is 1 - c = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, let P(attacker is black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(attacker is white) be the probability that the attacker is white. We have:

P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) = 1

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write the probability of the attacker being black in terms of the probability of the attacker being white:

P(attacker is black) = [P(witness correctly identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness correctly identifies black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness incorrectly identifies black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(attacker is black) = [c * P(attacker is black)] / [c * P(attacker is black) + e * P(attacker is white)]

We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Let P(attacker is black) = p. Then, we have:

p + (1 - p) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. P(attacker is black) = [c * p] / [c * p + e * (1 - p)]
2. p + (1 - p) = 0.85

We can solve these equations numerically to find the value of p.

After solving the equations, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31.

Therefore, {probability: 0.31} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
