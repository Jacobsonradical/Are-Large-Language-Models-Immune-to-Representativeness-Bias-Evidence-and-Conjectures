Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as black, which is an error in this context. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's mistake, is the error rate:

{probability: 0.2}

This means there is a 20% chance that the attacker is white, given the witness's mistake. However, the original population distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness's mistake is not necessarily representative of the true population distribution, it would be more appropriate to use the original distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the original population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.15}

This means there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black, based on the population distribution in the city.
