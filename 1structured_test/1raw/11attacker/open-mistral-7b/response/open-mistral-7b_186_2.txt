To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness statement).
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identified a black person) given the hypothesis.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability that the attacker is black before considering the evidence).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness statement) regardless of the hypothesis.

We have the following values:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)
- P(H) = Unknown (this is what we want to find)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not-H) * P(not-H)
  P(E | not-H) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)
  P(not-H) = 1 - P(H)

Since 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black, P(not-H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.85

We can rewrite the equation for P(H) in terms of P(H) and P(E):

P(H) = (P(E) - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

Plugging in the values for P(E) from the given data:

P(H) = (0.8 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.41

So the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 (41%).
