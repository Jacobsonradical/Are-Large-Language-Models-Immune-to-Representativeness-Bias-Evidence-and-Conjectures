To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- Prior probability of A (P(A)): 15% (from information b)
- Witness's ability to correctly identify race (P(B|A)): 80%
- Witness's ability to incorrectly identify race (P(not B|A)): 20%
- Proportion of white people in the city (P(not A)): 85%
- Witness's ability to correctly identify white people (P(B|not A)): 85%
- Witness's ability to incorrectly identify black people (P(not B|not A)): 15%

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85]

Calculating the numerator and the denominator:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.71375)

The final answer is:

{probability: 0.143, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

There is a 14.3% probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony.
