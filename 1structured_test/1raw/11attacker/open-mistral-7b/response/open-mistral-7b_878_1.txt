To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%).

Since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness making a mistake and still identifying the attacker as black. This can be written as:

P(black) = P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness incorrectly identifies black but believes it)

Using the given information, we can write this as:

P(black) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (or 15%)

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city, it is estimated that the attacker has a 15% chance of being black.
