Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The city population is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black in this case. However, we don't have any direct information about whether this was an error or not. Since we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, it might be reasonable to assume that there is a 20% chance that this was an error.

However, without more information, it's impossible to say for certain. Therefore, based on the information given, the best estimate we can make is that the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 (or 20%), but this estimate has a significant degree of uncertainty.
