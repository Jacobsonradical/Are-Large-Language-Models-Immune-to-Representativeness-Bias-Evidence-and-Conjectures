Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness was correct in this instance.

The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. Since the witness's accuracy is higher than their error rate, it's likely that they are more likely to correctly identify a white person than a black person given their errors.

Therefore, without more information, it's difficult to make a definitive estimate. However, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's performance and the population statistics.

The witness's incorrect identifications would likely involve mistaking black people for white people more often than the reverse, given the population statistics. Therefore, it seems less likely that the witness made an error in this case and misidentified a white person as black.

So, while we can't provide a strict probability, it seems reasonable to lean towards the attacker being black, given the witness's accuracy and the city's population statistics. However, without more information, this is just an educated guess and not a statistically sound estimate.

{probability: 0.6, this is a rough estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the city's population statistics, and it should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of direct evidence}
