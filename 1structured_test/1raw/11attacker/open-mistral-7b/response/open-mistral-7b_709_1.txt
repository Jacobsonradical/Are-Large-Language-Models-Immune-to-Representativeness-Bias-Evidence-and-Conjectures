To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula in statistics that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black (event H)
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black (event E)
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black

Given the information, we can assume that P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white), P(E|H) = 0.8, and P(E|~H) = 0.2 (given in the first piece of information).

Now, according to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, based on the evidence and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.22, or 22%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is consistent and independent of other factors, which may not always be the case.
