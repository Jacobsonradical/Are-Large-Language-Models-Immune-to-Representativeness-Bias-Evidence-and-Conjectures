To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can assume that their correct identifications are reliable.

Let's denote:
- P(Black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(White) as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that P(Black) + P(White) = 1 (total probability)

The witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the witness's identification is reliable 80% of the time, the probability of this event (the attacker being black) is:
P(Black) = Witness's correct identification rate

However, we also know the racial composition of the city. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is:
P(White) = 1 - P(Black) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we have two equations:
P(Black) = 0.8 (from the witness's identification)
P(Black) + P(White) = 1

Substituting P(White) into the second equation:
0.8 + 0.2 = 1

So, P(Black) = 0.8 and P(White) = 0.2

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
