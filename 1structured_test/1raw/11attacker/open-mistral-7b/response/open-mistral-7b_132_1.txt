Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that could potentially influence our estimate: the racial makeup of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The racial makeup of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there is an important distinction to be made. The witness's reliability is given in the context of a controlled environment where they are explicitly asked to identify the race of a person. In this case, the victim could not see the attacker's race and did not make an identification. Instead, a separate witness did, and the court assessed their reliability.

Therefore, to make a reliable estimate, we should consider both the racial makeup of the city and the error rate of the witness when they make an identification, but we need to account for the fact that the victim did not make a direct identification.

Let's assume that the error rate of the witness in this situation (when they make an identification under less controlled conditions) is the same as when they make an identification under controlled conditions. This is a reasonable assumption, as the witness's ability to identify race should not vary significantly based on the specific circumstances.

Given this, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black by considering the racial makeup of the city and the witness's error rate.

The probability that the witness errs and identifies a white person as black is 20%. Since the city's population is 85% white, the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 80%. Since the city's population is 15% black, the probability of a black person being correctly identified as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, we know that a black person was actually attacked. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black and the probability that the witness errs and identifies a white person as black but the victim incorrectly identifies the attacker as black (which we can assume is the same as the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white).

The probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white is 0.20. Since the victim cannot identify the attacker, they will also consider the attacker to be white in this case. The probability of this happening is the same as the probability of the witness erring, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black) + 0.20 * 0.17 (the probability of the witness erring and the victim mistakenly identifying the attacker as white).

This gives us a probability estimate of 0.35 or 35%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.35} is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.
