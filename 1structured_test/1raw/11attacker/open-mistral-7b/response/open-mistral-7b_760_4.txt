To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony, P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black.

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying a black person as black 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white)

We can compute P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%. This means that, based on the given information, it is slightly more likely that the attacker is black than white, but the evidence is not sufficient to make a strong conclusion.
