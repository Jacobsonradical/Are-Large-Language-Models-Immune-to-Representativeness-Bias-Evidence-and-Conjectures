To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 0.8 probability that they were correct and a 0.2 probability that they were incorrect.

Let's denote the true race of the attacker as T (either T=white or T=black). If the witness is correct, then T=black. If the witness is incorrect, then T=white.

The probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is black is 0.8 (the witness's correct percentage). The probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is white is 0.2 (the witness's incorrect percentage).

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of an attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15.

So, the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is black is 0.8, and the probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is white is 0.2.

The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, can be computed as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the attacker being black, and the probabilities of the witness being incorrect and the attacker being white, weighted by their respective probabilities:

0.8 (witness correct and attacker black) + 0.2 (witness incorrect and attacker white) * (probability of attacker being white given witness's incorrect identification)

First, let's calculate the probability of an attacker being white given that the witness identified the attacker as white (which doesn't happen in this case, but we need this value to compute the other probability):

0.2 (witness incorrect) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

0.8 (witness correct) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) + 0.2 (witness incorrect) * 0.17 (probability of attacker being white given witness's incorrect identification) = 0.12 + 0.034 = 0.154

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.154 or 15.4%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the given information and assumptions, and actual results may vary depending on various factors such as lighting conditions, witness's distance from the attacker, etc.
