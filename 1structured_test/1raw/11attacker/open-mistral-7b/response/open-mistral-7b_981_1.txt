Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time.
2. The racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our belief about a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H | E) is the probability we're trying to find (probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (probability of the witness making the statement given any attacker)

From the information, we know that:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H) (where ¬H is the opposite of H, i.e., the attacker is not black)
  P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)
  P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

So, we have:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
        ≈ 0.3448

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness statement is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
