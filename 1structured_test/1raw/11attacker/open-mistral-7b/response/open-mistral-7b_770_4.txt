Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given the occurrence of an event B is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we don't know.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from the information).
3. P(A|B) is the probability we are trying to find.
4. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person:

   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

   Here, P(~A) is the probability of the attacker being white, and P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

   Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we have P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85. So,

   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34.48%.
