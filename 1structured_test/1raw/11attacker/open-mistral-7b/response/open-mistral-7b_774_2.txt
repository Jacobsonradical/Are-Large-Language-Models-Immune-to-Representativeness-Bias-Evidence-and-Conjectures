To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (i.e., the probability that a black person would be misidentified as white by the witness)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (i.e., the probability of a black attacker before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (i.e., the probability of a witness misidentifying a person's race)

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness would misidentify a black person as white. Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time, this means they are wrong 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.2.

2. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): This is the probability of a witness misidentifying a person's race. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 (the probability of being correct) + 0.2 (the probability of being wrong) = 1.0.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
      = (0.2 * 0.15) / 1.0
      = 0.03

Therefore, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is 3%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, which may not always be the case.
