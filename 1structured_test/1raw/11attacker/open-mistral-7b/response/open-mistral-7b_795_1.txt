To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the attacker is black, and 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making this statement, given that the attacker is black or not black)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|not H), but we can use the law of total probability to find it:

P(E|not H) = P(E and not H) / P(not H) = (1 - P(H)) * P(E|not H) = 0.85 * P(E|not H)

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(E|not H) directly, we can't find a definite value for P(H|E). However, we can find an approximate value by assuming that P(E|not H) is the same as P(E|H), which would mean that the witness's ability to identify race is not affected by the race of the person they're looking at. In this case, P(E|not H) = 0.8.

Using this assumption, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.667

So, our estimate, based on the assumption that P(E|not H) = 0.8, is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.667 or 66.7%. However, it's important to note that this is an approximation, and the actual probability might be different if P(E|not H) is not equal to 0.8.
