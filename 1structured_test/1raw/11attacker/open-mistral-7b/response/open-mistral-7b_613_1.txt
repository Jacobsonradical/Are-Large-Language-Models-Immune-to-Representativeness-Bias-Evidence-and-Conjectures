To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the overall racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

1. According to the provided information, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect. In similar conditions, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since we don't have any information about the race of the actual attacker, we can't be certain that the witness made an error in this case. But, considering the witness's error rate, it's likely that the witness made an error 20% of the time.
4. This means that, out of the times when the witness incorrectly identifies the race (20% of the time), the attacker is more likely to be white than black, since 85% of the population is white.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the race (80%) minus the probability that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black (20% * probability that the attacker is white).
6. To find the probability that the attacker is white, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is white and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
7. Since we don't have the exact value of P(B), we can assume it to be 1 (because the witness made an identification). Then, P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is white), and P(B|A) = 1 - 0.20 (the probability that the witness makes an error when the attacker is white).
8. Using the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is white: P(A|B) = (1 - 0.20) * 0.85 / 1 = 0.75.
9. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.25.
