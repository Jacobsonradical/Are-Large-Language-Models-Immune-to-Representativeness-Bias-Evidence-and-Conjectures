Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability (before the new evidence) is the probability of the attacker being black in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (this is what we want to find)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given in the first piece of information)
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white (given in the first piece of information)
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified a black person (the probability we want to find)
- P(~A|B) as the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness identified a black person

We have that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying a black person, which is a mixture of the correct identification of a black person and the incorrect identification of a white person as black.

Given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|~A) = 0.2, and that 85% of the population is white (P(~A) = 0.85), we can calculate P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26.

Since P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), we can rearrange the equation to find P(A) = (P(B) - P(B|~A) * P(~A)) / P(B|A).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A) = (0.26 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 = 0.175

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.175 or 17.5%.
