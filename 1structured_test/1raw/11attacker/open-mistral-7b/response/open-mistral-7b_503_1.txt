Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness identified the attacker as black, but the victim could not see the attacker's race themselves. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's testimony alone would be the witness's reliability, which is 0.8.

However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so we also need to consider the racial makeup of the city. If the attacker could have been any race, then the probability of the attacker being black would be the same as the racial makeup of the city, which is 0.15.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the attacker's race was concealed by circumstances or if the witness's identification is unreliable in this specific case, we can't make a definitive estimate. Therefore, the best estimate would be a weighted average of the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city, which would be (0.8 * 0) + (0.15 * 1) = 0.15.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's identification is completely unreliable in this specific case, which may not be the case. If we assume that the witness's identification is as reliable in this case as it is in general, then the probability of the attacker being black would be the witness's reliability, which is 0.8.

Therefore, the strict answer to the question is: {probability: 0.15 or 0.8, depending on the assumptions made about the witness's reliability in this specific case}
