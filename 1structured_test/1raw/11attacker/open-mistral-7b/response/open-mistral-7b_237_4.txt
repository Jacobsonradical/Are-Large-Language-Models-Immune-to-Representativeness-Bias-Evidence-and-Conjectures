Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect at identifying race, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and errs 20% of the time.

Let's assume the witness's error rate is equally distributed between misidentifying whites as blacks and misidentifying blacks as whites. This means the witness errs 10% of the time for each race (20% total error rate divided by 2).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black (correct identification).
2. The witness made an error and incorrectly identified a white person as black (incorrect identification).

The probability of the first scenario is the actual percentage of black people in the city, which is 15%. The probability of the second scenario is the witness's error rate for misidentifying whites as blacks, which is 10%.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the first scenario (correct identification) plus half of the probability of the second scenario (incorrect identification):

{probability: 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.2, probability of the attacker being black is approximately 20%}
