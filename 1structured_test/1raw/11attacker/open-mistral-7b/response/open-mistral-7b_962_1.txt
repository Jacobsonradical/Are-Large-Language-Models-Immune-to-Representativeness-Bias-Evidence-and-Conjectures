To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. If the witness says the attacker is black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error and mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability that the attacker is black, which we want to find. The probability of the second scenario is the error rate, 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the first scenario is the probability of picking a black person from the population. Since 15% of the population is black, this probability is 0.15.

So, the probability of the second scenario is 0.2, and the probability of the first scenario is 0.15. Since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to 1:

0.15 (first scenario) + 0.2 (second scenario) = 0.35

However, the witness did not make a statement, but rather identified the attacker as black. This means that the first scenario is what we're interested in because it represents the attacker actually being black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's observation, is the probability of the first scenario:

{probability: 0.15}
