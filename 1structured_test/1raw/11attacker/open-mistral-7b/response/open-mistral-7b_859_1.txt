Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's ability to identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's error.

The racial demographics of the city suggest that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. However, this information is not relevant to the witness's error, as the witness cannot see the racial demographics of the city at night.

Therefore, based on the witness's error, the probability that the attacker is black is 20%.
