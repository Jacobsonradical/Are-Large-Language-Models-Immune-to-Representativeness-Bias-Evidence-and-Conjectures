Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information suggesting that the witness is more likely to make an error in identifying a black person, we can assume that the error rate is the same for both races.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If the witness saw someone at night and identified them as black, the likelihood that the person is actually black is the probability that the witness made a correct identification, given that the person is black. This probability can be calculated as the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a black person out of all the times they identify a black person, which is 0.8 (80%) because the witness errs in 20% of cases.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (the probability of a correct identification given a black person).

However, we also know the demographic distribution of the city. If the attacker is black, the probability that the witness would identify them as black is the proportion of black people in the city. Since 15% of the city's population is black, this probability is 0.15.

To find the overall probability that the attacker is black, we need to multiply the witness's probability of correct identification given a black person with the probability of seeing a black person in the city:

P(attacker is black) = P(correct identification given black person) * P(seeing a black person) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This means that there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the demographic distribution of the city.
