To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A: The attacker is black
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as black

Given the information:
1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black = Unknown (Let's denote it as x)
2. P(B|A) = The witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black when the attacker is black = 0.8 (80% accuracy)
3. P(B|not A) = The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race as black when the attacker is not black = 0.2 (20% error)
4. P(A) = P(not A) = 1 (since the probabilities of both events must sum up to 1)
5. P(B) = Probability that the witness identified the attacker as black = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Using the given population statistics (event not A), we can calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = P(white) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x)

Using the witness's ability to judge a person's race, we have an equation with two unknowns:
0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * (1 - 0.85)

Solving this equation for x, we get x â‰ˆ 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
