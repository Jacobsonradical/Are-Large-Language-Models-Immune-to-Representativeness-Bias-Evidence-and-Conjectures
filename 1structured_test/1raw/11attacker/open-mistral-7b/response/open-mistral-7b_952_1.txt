Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that in this specific case, the witness erred.

The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. But since the witness's error rate is 20%, we need to adjust for this when estimating the probability that the attacker is black.

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness's error and the probability of the witness's correct identification. The probability of the witness's error is 20%, and the probability of the witness's correct identification is 1 - 20% = 80%.

Given that the witness erred in this case, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness's error, which is 0.2 or 20%. This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is black, and an 80% chance that the attacker is white, given the information available.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.2}
