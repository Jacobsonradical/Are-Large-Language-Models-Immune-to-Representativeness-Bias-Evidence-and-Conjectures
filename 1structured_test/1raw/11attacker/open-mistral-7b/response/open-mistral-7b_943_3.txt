To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

The witness has an 80% success rate in correctly identifying race and a 20% error rate. This means that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, and in 20% of cases, the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, P(B|non-A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, and P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Since the witness is more likely to identify a white person as black than a black person as black (due to the city's racial composition), we need to calculate P(B|non-A) first.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B). Since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|non-A) * P(non-A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1465
P(B) = 0.2665

Now, we can calculate P(A|B).

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2665]
P(A|B) = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.24, or 24%.
