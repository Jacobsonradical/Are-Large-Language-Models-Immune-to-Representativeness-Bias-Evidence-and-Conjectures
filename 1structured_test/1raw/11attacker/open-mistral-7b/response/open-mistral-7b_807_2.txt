To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can calculate from the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white, which can be calculated as 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.85
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person, which is also given as 0.8

Now, we can calculate the probability of the evidence (the witness's identification) given the hypothesis (the attacker being black), using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.22 or 22%. This estimate takes into account the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.
