Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies the race. Since 85% of the population is white, we can expect that the witness will correctly identify a white attacker 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68% of the time.

Similarly, since 15% of the population is black, we can expect that the witness will correctly identify a black attacker 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% of the time if they guess based on the demographics alone.

However, the witness did identify the attacker as black. This increases the probability that the attacker is indeed black, even if the witness made an error. We can calculate this probability by adding the baseline probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (0.12) to the probability that the witness made an error but still correctly identified a black attacker (0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3%).

So, the total probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 15%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.15} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
