To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black)
- P(E) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence (the probability of the witness making this identification, regardless of the actual attacker's race)
- P(H | E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (the updated probability of the attacker being black, given the evidence)

We are given the following information:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * (1 - P(H)) (the marginal likelihood of the evidence)

We are also given that the population is 85% white and 15% black. This means that the prior probability P(H) is 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black) and the prior probability P(¬H) is 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white).

To find P(E | ¬H), we can use the complementary probability: P(E | ¬H) = 1 - P(E | H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H | E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 = 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
