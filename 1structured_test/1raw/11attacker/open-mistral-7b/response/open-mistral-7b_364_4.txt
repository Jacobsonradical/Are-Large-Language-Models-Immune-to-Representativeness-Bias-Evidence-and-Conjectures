Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

Let's define our variables:
- H0: The attacker is white
- H1: The attacker is black
- E: The witness says the attacker is black

We are interested in P(H1|E), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness said the attacker is black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

We are given P(E|H1) = 0.8 (the witness was correct 80% of the time when the attacker was black)
P(E|H0) = 0.2 (the witness was correct 20% of the time when the attacker was white)
P(H1) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given the city's population)
P(H0) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being white, given the city's population)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we find that P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, based on the witness's statement and the city's population demographics, there is an estimated 25% chance that the attacker is black.
