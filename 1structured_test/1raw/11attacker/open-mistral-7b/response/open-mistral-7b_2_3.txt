Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have any direct information about how accurately the witness identified the attacker's race.

If we assume that the witness's performance was representative of their identification of the attacker, we could calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on their error rate. Since the error rate is 20%, this means that the witness incorrectly identified a person as black 20% of the time when that person was actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, this means that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

However, since we don't know if the witness's performance was representative of their identification of the attacker, we cannot make a definitive estimate. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate.
