Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial distribution of the city.

The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is uniform (i.e., they make mistakes at a constant rate, regardless of the actual race of the person), then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let P(Black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(Witness says Black | Black) and P(Witness says Black | Not Black) be the probabilities that the witness correctly identifies a black person and incorrectly identifies a non-black person, respectively.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black)] / [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness says Black | Not Black) * P(Not Black)]

Given that the witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time (P(Witness says Black | Black) = 0.8), and 85% of the population is white (P(Not Black) = 0.85), we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(Black | Witness says Black) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 18%.
