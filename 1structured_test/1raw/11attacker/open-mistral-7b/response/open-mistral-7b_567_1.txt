To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies a person's race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error in identifying the race.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B). Then, according to the provided information, we can write the following equation:

P(B) = P(B and correct identification) + P(B and error in identification)

We know that P(B and correct identification) = 0.8 * P(B) and P(B and error in identification) = 0.2 * P(not B), where P(not B) = 1 - P(B).

Since 85% of the population is white, P(not B) = 0.15.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * 0.15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(B) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
