To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * P(white) + 0.15 * 0 = 0.85 * P(white).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * P(black).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event occurring if the attacker is black is P(black) and the probability of this event occurring if the attacker is white is 0.85 * P(white).

The witness's statement is consistent with the attacker being black if the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is less than the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. That is, 0.85 * P(white) < 0.2 * P(black).

Solving this inequality gives us P(black) > 0.14 / (0.85 - 0.2) â‰ˆ 0.22.

However, we must consider the possibility of the witness's bias. Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white 20% of the time, there is a chance that the witness might be biased against black people. To account for this, let's assume the witness has a slight bias and incorrectly identifies a black person as white 25% of the time instead of 20%. This means the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.25 * P(black).

In this case, the inequality becomes 0.85 * P(white) < 0.25 * P(black), and solving this inequality gives us P(black) > 0.16.

Since we cannot determine an exact probability based on the given information, we can provide a range of possible probabilities. Given the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population, the probability that the attacker is black is likely between 0.16 and 0.22.
