Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem is expressed as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. In this case, the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, regardless of the hypothesis. To find this, we can use the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H represents the complementary hypothesis (attacker is not black). Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2. And P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.24.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.333

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.333 or 33.3%.
