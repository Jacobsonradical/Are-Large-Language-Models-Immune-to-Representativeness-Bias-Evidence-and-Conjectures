Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying races.

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an observed event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the probabilities of all possible events.

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black attacker.

The probability of event A (the attacker being black) is 0.15 (15%).

The probability of event B given event A (the witness correctly identifying a black attacker) is 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate).

The probability of event B given not event A (the witness incorrectly identifying a black attacker) is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

The prior probability of event B (the witness making any identification) is 1 (given that an identification was made).

So, using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives an estimate of 0.28, or 28%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's racial demographics, is approximately 28%.
