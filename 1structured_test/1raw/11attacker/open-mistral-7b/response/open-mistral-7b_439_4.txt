To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (given by the witness's accuracy: 0.8)
- P(~B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black (given by the witness's error rate: 0.2)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness seeing the attacker and making the observation W (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness seeing the attacker and making the observation W, given that the attacker is white

We know that P(W|B) = P(B|W) and P(W|~B) = P(~B|W) * P(~B)

We are given that P(B) = 0.15, P(B|W) = 0.8, and P(~B|W) = 0.2. We need to find P(~B) = P(white attacker) to complete Bayes' theorem.

Since the population is 85% white, P(white attacker) = P(~B) = 0.85.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.221

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 22.1%.
