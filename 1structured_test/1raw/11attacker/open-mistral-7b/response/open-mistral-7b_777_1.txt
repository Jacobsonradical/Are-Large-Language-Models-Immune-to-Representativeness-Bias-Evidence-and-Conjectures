Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the witness cannot see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this specific case.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can assume that if the witness were to see the attacker under ideal conditions, they would correctly identify the race 80% of the time. But in this case, the witness is unable to see the attacker's race.

Since the city's population is heavily skewed towards white (85%), it's more likely that the attacker is white. Therefore, if the witness were to guess the attacker's race based on the city's demographics, they would guess white 85% of the time and black 15% of the time.

However, since the witness's error rate is 20%, even if they guess based on the city's demographics, they will still make mistakes. So, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being black in this scenario is slightly higher than the 15% population proportion, but not by much due to the witness's error rate.

Given these considerations, a conservative estimate for the probability that the attacker is black would be around 18% (15% + 3% for the witness's error rate).
