Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's incorrect identification, is the inverse of the error rate.

So, {probability: 0.2, this means there is a 20% chance that the attacker is black}
