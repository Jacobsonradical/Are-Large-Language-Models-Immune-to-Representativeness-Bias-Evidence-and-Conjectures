To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring when they actually see a black person. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. Therefore, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person. This is simply the complement of the probability of erring: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the most likely scenario is that they were correct. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%).

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
