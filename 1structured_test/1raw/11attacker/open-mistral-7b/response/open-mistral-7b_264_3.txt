Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability in identifying race and the city's racial demographics.

1. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. If the witness erred, they would have incorrectly identified the attacker as black, even though the attacker was actually white. The probability of this error happening is 20% (the witness's error rate).

However, since the city is predominantly white (85%), it would be more likely for the witness to mistake a white person for a black person if they erred. In other words, the error in this case would be more likely to result in misidentifying a white person as black than a black person as white.

Therefore, we should adjust the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's error rate and the city's racial demographics. We can do this by multiplying the probability of the witness making a correct identification by the attacker's actual probability of being black, and then adding this to the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a white person as black.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is 1 - the witness's error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

The probability of the attacker being black if the witness made a correct identification is simply the city's racial demographic for blacks, which is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given a correct identification is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a white person as black is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2.

The probability of the attacker being black given an error is the city's racial demographic for whites, which is 0.85, multiplied by the error rate (since the error would result in misidentifying a white person as black). This is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black by adding the two probabilities we just calculated:

0.12 (probability of attacker being black given a correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of attacker being black given an error) = 0.29

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
