Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, this implies an error in their assessment. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's mistake, is the error rate of 20%.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. Since the witness made an error, it's more likely that they mistakenly identified a white person as black than the other way around, given the city's demographics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's mistake.

The probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's mistake, is 0.2 (the error rate). So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, {probability: 0.8}
