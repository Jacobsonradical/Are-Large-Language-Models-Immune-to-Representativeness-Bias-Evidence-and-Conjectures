Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, and the city's racial composition is 15% black and 85% white.

To calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, we can multiply the probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's racial composition) by the witness's reliability (80%).

We can do the same for the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race as black, which is the probability of the attacker being white (given by the city's racial composition) multiplied by the witness's error rate (20%).

The total probability of the witness's identification being correct or incorrect is 100%. Therefore, we can find the probability that the attacker is black by subtracting the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race from 1.

Here's the calculation:

1. Probability of attacker being black: 0.15 (15%)
2. Probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
3. Probability of attacker being white: 0.85 (85%)
4. Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white attacker as black: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
5. Total probability of witness's identification being correct or incorrect: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
6. Probability that the attacker is black: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 83%.
