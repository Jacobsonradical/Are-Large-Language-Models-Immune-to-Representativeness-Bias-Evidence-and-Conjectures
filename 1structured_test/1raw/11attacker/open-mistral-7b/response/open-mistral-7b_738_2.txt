Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who has an 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate, identified the attacker as black.

Since we don't have any additional information that would allow us to adjust the error rate, we can assume that the witness's error rate applies to both incorrectly identifying a black person as white and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

1. The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is black is 0.2 (20%).
3. The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white is 0.2 (20% error rate, assuming the error rate applies to both races).
4. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 0.8 (80% success rate, assuming the error rate applies to both races).

However, we only know that the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that we have some information about the probability of P(black) but not enough to calculate it directly.

Instead, we can set up an equation based on the probabilities of the witness making correct and incorrect identifications:

The probability of the witness saying "black" and the attacker being black is 0.8 * P(black).
The probability of the witness saying "black" and the attacker being white is 0.2 * (1 - P(black)).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the sum of these two probabilities must equal 1:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 1

Solving this equation gives us an estimate for P(black):

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.8

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both races. If the witness has a bias, this estimate might not accurately reflect the true probability. Without more information, it's impossible to account for this potential bias.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this estimate assumes equal error rates for both races}
