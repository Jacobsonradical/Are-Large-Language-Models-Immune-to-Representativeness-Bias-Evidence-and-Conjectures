To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they will correctly identify them as black 80% of the time. Similarly, when the witness sees a white person, they will incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the victim saw a white person is 0.85. The probability that the witness erroneously identified this white person as black is 0.20.

Since there are twice as many white people as black, the probability that the victim saw a black person is 0.15. The probability that the witness correctly identified this black person as black is 0.80.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identified attacker as black) * P(attacker is black | witness sees black) + P(witness erroneously identified attacker as black) * P(attacker is white | witness sees black)

P(witness correctly identified attacker as black) = 0.8
P(attacker is black | witness sees black) = 1
P(witness erroneously identified attacker as black) = 0.2
P(attacker is white | witness sees black) = 0

So, P(attacker is black) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8 or 80%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify races remains constant under all conditions, which may not be the case. In reality, the actual probability might be different.
