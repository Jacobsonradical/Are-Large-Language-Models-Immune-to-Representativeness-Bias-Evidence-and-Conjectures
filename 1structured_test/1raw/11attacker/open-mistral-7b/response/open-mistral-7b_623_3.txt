To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(White).

We have two pieces of information:

1) P(Black) + P(White) = 1 (total probability)
2) The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 20%. This means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Since the city is predominantly white, the number of white people the witness encounters is likely higher than the number of black people. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is lower than 0.8.

Let's denote this probability as P(Witness corrects).

From the information we have, we can write two equations:

1) P(Black) * 0.8 + P(White) * 0.2 = 0.8 (the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black)
2) P(Black) = 0.15 (the actual proportion of black people in the city)

From equation 2, we can express P(White) = 0.85.

Now, we can substitute these into equation 1:

0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, this is not the probability we're looking for. Instead, we need to find P(Black | Witness identifies as black), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

This probability can be calculated as the ratio of the number of times the witness correctly identifies a black person to the total number of times the witness identifies someone as black:

P(Black | Witness identifies as black) = P(Witness corrects) * P(Black) / (P(Witness corrects) * P(Black) + P(Witness incorrectly identifies as black) * P(White))

Substituting the values we calculated above:

P(Black | Witness identifies as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(Black | Witness identifies as black) â‰ˆ 0.264

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.264 or 26.4%.
