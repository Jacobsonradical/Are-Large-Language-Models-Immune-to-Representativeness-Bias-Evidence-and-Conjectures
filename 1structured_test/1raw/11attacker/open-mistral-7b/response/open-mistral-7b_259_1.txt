To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, since we don't know if the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a white person as black or vice versa, we cannot use the raw error rate.

Let's assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistaken in either direction. In this case, the witness's correct identification rate for whites is 80% - 20%/2 = 0.8 - 0.1 = 0.7, and the correct identification rate for blacks is 0.8.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85 and the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 0.15.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the product of the witness's correct identification rate for blacks and the probability that a randomly chosen person is black. That is, 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, because we cannot assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistaken in either direction, this calculation may be an overestimate. Therefore, a more conservative estimate might be to take the witness's overall correct identification rate of 0.8 as an upper bound on the probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, {probability: 0.8} is a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, but it should be noted that this estimate assumes that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistaken in either direction, which may not be the case.
