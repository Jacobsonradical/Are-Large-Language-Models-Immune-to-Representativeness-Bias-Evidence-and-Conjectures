Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A (attacker is black) given an event B (witness's identification) is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let:
- A: Attacker is black
- B: Witness identifies attacker as black

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance of the attacker being black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time, where ~A means not black)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

To find P(B), we need to know P(~A), which is the probability of the attacker being white. P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
