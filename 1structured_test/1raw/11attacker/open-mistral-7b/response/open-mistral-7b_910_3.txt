Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and is mistaken 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race as black (given that the attacker is actually white) is P(white) * Error rate = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black (given that the attacker is actually black) is P(black) * Accuracy rate = P(black) * 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation:

Witness's observation = P(black) * 0.8 + 0.17

Given that the witness observed that the attacker is black, we can set this equal to 1 and solve for P(black):

P(black) = (1 - 0.17) / 0.8 = 0.8375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8375 or 83.75%.
