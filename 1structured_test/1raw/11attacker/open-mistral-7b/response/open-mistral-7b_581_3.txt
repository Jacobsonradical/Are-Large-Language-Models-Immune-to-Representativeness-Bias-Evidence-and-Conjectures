Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not precise in identifying race, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability. Since we don't know if the witness's error was in this case, we'll consider both possibilities:

1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness is wrong, and the attacker is actually white.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

1. If the witness is correct, the probability that the attacker is black is the proportion of black people in the population: 0.15 (or 15%)
2. If the witness is wrong, the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is the error rate of the witness: 0.2 (or 20%)

Since the witness lives in a city where 85% of the population is white, the probability of picking a white person at random is 0.85. So, the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Now, we need to account for the fact that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since this was an error, the actual probability that the attacker is white is the probability of the witness making an error times the probability of picking a white person at random: 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1465 (or 14.65%).

Finally, since we want the probability that the attacker is black, we subtract the probability that the attacker is white from 1:

probability = 1 - 0.1465 = 0.8535 (or 85.35%)

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 85.35%.
