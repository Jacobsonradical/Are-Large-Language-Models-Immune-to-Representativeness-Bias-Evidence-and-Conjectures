Given the information provided, the population statistics suggest that the attacker is likely to be white (85%) based on city demographics. However, a witness has identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate. Since the witness's identification is not perfect, we should consider both the population statistics and the witness's ability to identify race.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case:
- A: attacker is black
- B: witness identifies attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being black based on city demographics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's success rate in identifying black individuals)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying non-black individuals as black)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being white based on city demographics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.12 (calculated using Bayes' theorem with P(A) and P(B|A))

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.63

So, given the witness's identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.63. This estimate takes into account both the city demographics and the witness's ability to identify race.
