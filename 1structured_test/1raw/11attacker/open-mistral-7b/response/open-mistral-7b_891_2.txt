Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that an event B has occurred, P(A|B), is equal to the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, P(B|A), multiplied by the prior probability of event A, P(A), divided by the probability of event B, P(B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is black (event A), given that the witness identified the attacker as black (event B).

We are provided with two pieces of information:
1. P(A) = Probability of the attacker being black = 15%
2. P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black = 80%
3. P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We don't have the exact value of P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black). However, we do have the complementary probability of P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (20%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41.38%.
