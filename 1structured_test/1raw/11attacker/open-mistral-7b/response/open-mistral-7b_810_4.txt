To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as black, which could be an error given the 85% white population in the city.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). The probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is white, is 0.2 (the witness's error rate, given a white attacker).

The total probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is the probability of a black attacker multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker, plus the probability of a white attacker multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black.

So, P(black attacker and correct identification) = 0.15 (probability of a black attacker) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) + 0.85 (probability of a white attacker) * 0.2 (witness's error rate)

However, this calculation assumes that the witness is equally likely to make an error in identifying either race, which may not be the case given the racial composition of the city. To account for this, we can multiply the probability of a white attacker being misidentified as black by the probability of a black attacker being correctly identified, and vice versa.

So, P(black attacker and correct identification) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) * (0.15 / 0.15 + 0.85 / 0.8)

This calculation gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, which is approximately 0.29.
