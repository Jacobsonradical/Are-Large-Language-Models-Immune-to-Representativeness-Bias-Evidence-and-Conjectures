Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is only 80%, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black can be estimated by considering the probability that the witness was correct and the probability that the witness was incorrect.

The probability that the witness was correct is the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15%. The probability that the witness was incorrect is the proportion of white people in the city, which is 85%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability that the witness was correct, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness was incorrect. If the witness was incorrect, then the attacker must be white. Given the witness's error rate of 20%, the probability that the witness was incorrect is 0.20 (or 20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is actually white is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probability that the witness was correct and the probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is white, which is 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.205 or 20.5%.

However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case. In reality, the witness's error rate may vary depending on the lighting conditions, distance, and other factors. Therefore, this estimate should be treated as an approximation and not as a definitive answer.
