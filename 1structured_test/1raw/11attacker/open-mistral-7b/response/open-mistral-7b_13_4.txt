The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as the product of the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) and the prior probability of event A (P(A)), divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|~A) = 0.2.
4. P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 85% or 0.85.
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This probability can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.252.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.252 â‰ˆ 0.318

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.318 or 31.8%.
