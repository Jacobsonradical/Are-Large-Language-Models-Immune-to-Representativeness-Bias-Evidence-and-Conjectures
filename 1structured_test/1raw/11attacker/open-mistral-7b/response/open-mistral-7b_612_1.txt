Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. We also know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis times the prior probability of the hypothesis:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15%.

P(E | H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's success rate of 80%.

P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker correctly and the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a white attacker as black:

P(E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) + P(E | not H) \* P(not H)

P(E | not H) is the probability of the witness identifying a white attacker as black, which is given as the witness's error rate of 20%. P(not H) is the probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 85%.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 48%.
