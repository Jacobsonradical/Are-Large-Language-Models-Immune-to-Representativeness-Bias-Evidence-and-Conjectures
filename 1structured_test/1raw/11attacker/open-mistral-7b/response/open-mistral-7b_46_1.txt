To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker could be any race, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as black is 20% (the witness's error rate for identifying black people).

However, we know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Therefore, the actual probability that the attacker is black is the inverse of the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black is also 20%. So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15 / 0.2 = 0.75, or 75%}

This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant for all races and that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's observation. However, these assumptions may not hold in reality and could affect the actual probability.
