To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, while erring 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Now, let's calculate the probability. If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify him as black 20% of the time, given the witness's error rate. Similarly, if the attacker was black, the witness would correctly identify him as black 80% of the time.

So, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (error rate). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8.

Given the city's racial distribution, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white). The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is white:

P(witness mistakes white attacker) = probability of attacker being white * probability of witness mistakenly identifying white attacker as black
                                                           = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                           = 0.17

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker:

P(witness correctly identifies black attacker) = probability of attacker being black * probability of witness correctly identifying black attacker as black
                                                                          = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                          = 0.12

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use the total probability rule to find the probability of the attacker being black:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black attacker) / [P(witness correctly identifies black attacker) + P(witness mistakes white attacker)]
                                     = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                     â‰ˆ 0.41

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
