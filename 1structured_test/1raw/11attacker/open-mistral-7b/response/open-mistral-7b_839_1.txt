To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given in the second piece of information: 80% or 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person (since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the probability of the witness not identifying the attacker as black (this is the complement of P(B), which is 1 - P(B) = 0.2)

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.28

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 28%. This means that, considering the evidence provided, there is a 28% chance that the attacker is black and a 72% chance that the attacker is white.
