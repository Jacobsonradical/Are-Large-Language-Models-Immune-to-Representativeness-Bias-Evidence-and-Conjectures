To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, let's consider the two pieces of information provided:

1. The population breakdown in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to correctly identify race is 80% and whose error rate is 20%, identified the attacker as black.

Given this information, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the population statistics alone, as we don't know if the witness's encounter with the attacker was a random event or if the attacker was disproportionately represented in the area at the time of the incident.

However, we can use the witness's reliability to help us make an informed guess. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and that there is no bias in encountering either race in the area, then the probability that the witness made a mistake and incorrectly identified the attacker as black is 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is indeed black, then the witness will correctly identify the attacker 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification times the probability of the attacker being black in the population, plus the probability of the witness making a mistake times the probability of the attacker not being black in the population:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness is correct and attacker is black) + P(witness is incorrect and attacker is not black)
                                    = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                                    ≈ 0.12 + 0.17
                                    ≈ 0.29

So, based on the given information, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.29 (29%). This estimate takes into account both the population breakdown and the witness's reliability. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and does not account for potential biases or other factors that might affect the situation.
