To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E. This is what we're trying to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H. This is given as 0.8 in the problem (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black 80% of the time).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E. This is the probability of the witness making the statement, given any attacker's race.

We're given that the population is 85% white and 15% black. So, the probability of the witness seeing a black person is 0.15 (15%), and the probability of seeing a white person is 0.85 (85%).

However, the witness doesn't know the race of the attacker, so they can't make a statement with 100% certainty. So, the probability of the witness making the statement "I saw a black person" is the sum of the probability of them being correct (0.8) and the probability of them being wrong (0.2).

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 = 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.4 or 40%.
