Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the distribution of races in the city, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, given that the person is actually black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black in the population)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race)

First, let's calculate P(A) from the information provided in "a":

P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black)

Next, let's calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as black, given that the person is actually black)

Now, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness's accuracy is given for a mix of white and black people, we can assume that P(B|not A) is the same as P(B|A), and P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is white).

Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.69

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.69 â‰ˆ 0.26

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 26%.
