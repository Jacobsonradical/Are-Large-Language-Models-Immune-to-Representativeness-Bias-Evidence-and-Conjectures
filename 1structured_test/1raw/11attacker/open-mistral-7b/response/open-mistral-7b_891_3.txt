Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This is our prior probability based on the demographics of the city.

Second, we have information about the witness's ability to judge a person's race. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be mistakes in identifying a white person as a black person and vice versa, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is proportional to the product of the prior probability of H and the likelihood of E given H, divided by the probability of E:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can simplify the equation by assuming that the probability of the evidence E does not change regardless of the prior probability of the attacker being black or white, so P(E) cancels out.

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

We are given that P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time) and P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

We are also given that P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is black) and P(not H) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is white).

Using these values, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.17 = 0.706

So our estimate, based on Bayes' theorem and the given information, is that there is a 70.6% probability that the attacker is black.
