Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any information about the race of the attacker being correct or incorrect in this specific instance.

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot make a precise estimation of the probability that the attacker is black. A more accurate estimate would require additional information, such as whether the witness's identification was correct or not.

However, if we were to make an assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker, we could make an estimate based on the witness's success rate. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be 0.8 (80%).

So, strictly in the dictionary format:
{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an assumption-based estimate and not a definitive probability}
