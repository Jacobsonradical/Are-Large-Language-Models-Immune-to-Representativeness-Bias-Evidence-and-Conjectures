To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the overall racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 or 68%.

Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.

However, the witness identified the attacker as black. Since they incorrectly identify white people as black only 3% of the time, it's more likely that the attacker is actually black than white, given the witness's identification.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 or 97%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.97}
