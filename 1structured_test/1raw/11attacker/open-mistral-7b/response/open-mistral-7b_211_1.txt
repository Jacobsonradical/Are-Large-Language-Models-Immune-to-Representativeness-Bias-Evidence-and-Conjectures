To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker is black
- E: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black (white)
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being white

From the information given, we know that:
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Now, we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.276

So, given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 27.6%.
