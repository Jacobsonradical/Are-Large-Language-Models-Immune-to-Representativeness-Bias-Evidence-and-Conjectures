To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the city's population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white). We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1.

We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness mistakenly identifies them as black is 20/100 = 0.2. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness correctly identifies them as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, the probability we are interested in is P(black | witness identified as black). Given that there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the probability of a random person being white is 2 * 0.85 = 0.71.

Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is P(black | witness identified as black) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is P(white | witness identified as black) = 0.2.

Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the probability of a random person being white given that the witness identified someone as black is P(white | witness identified as black) / P(black) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25.

Since the probability of a random person being white is 0.71, the probability of a random person being black is P(black) = 1 - P(white) = 1 - 0.71 = 0.29.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black is P(black | witness identified as black) = 0.8, which is approximately 80%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.8} or 80%.
