Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:

- H: the attacker is black
- ∼H: the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of H, P(H), is given in the first piece of information: 15%.

The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is given in the second piece of information: 80%.

The likelihood of E given ∼H, P(E|∼H), is the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black one: 20%.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|∼H) * P(∼H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

This simplifies to:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 12%.
