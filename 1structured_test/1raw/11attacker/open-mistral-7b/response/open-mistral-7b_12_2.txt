The information provided about the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the demographics of the city can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B). The witness mistakenly identified a race 20% of the time. Since there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, the error rate for each race is 20%. So, if the attacker is white, the witness has a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying them as black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's error rate. This is called the Bayes' theorem likelihood ratio.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(B | observed) = P(observed | B) * P(B) / [P(observed | B) * P(B) + P(observed | not B) * P(not B)]

In this case, P(observed | B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8. P(B) is the probability we're trying to find, P(observed | not B) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2. P(not B) is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - P(B).

So, the formula becomes:

P(B | observed) = 0.8 * P(B) / [0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * (1 - P(B))]

We can solve this equation for P(B) to get our estimate.

However, without specific values for P(B), we cannot provide a numerical estimate. We would need more information to determine the probability that the attacker is black.
