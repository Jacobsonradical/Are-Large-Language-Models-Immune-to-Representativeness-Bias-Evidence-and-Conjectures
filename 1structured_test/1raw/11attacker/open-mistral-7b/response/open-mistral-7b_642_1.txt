To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial distribution in the city.

1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, and a 20% error rate.
2. The city population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's calculate the probability:

1. First, let's calculate the probability that the witness errs when they see a black person: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.8.
3. Since the city has 15% black population, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city).
4. The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 0.15 \* 0.8 = 0.12
5. The probability that the witness errs, mistakenly identifying a white person as black, is 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.17
6. The total probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
7. Since the witness told the police that the attacker was black, and they can be wrong 29% of the time, the actual probability that the attacker is black is lower than what the witness reported.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

However, considering that the witness might have made an error, a more conservative estimate could be lower than this. For example, we could estimate the probability to be around 0.10 (10%).
