Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can only consider the witness's statement and the city's demographics as evidence.

The probability of the witness being correct (attacker is black) is the product of the witness's correct identification rate and the proportion of blacks in the city.

Let P(attacker is black) be the probability we are interested in. Then, we can write an equation as follows:

P(attacker is black) = Witness's correct identification rate * Proportion of blacks in the city

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
