To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. If we assume the attacker's race is random (which is an assumption, as we don't have any information suggesting otherwise), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race as black would be equal to the proportion of white people in the city, which is 0.85 (85%).

So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, we know that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time. So, the actual proportion of black people in the city that the witness correctly identifies as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
