The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the provided information, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows for the calculation of conditional probabilities.

In this case, the conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's statement (B). The prior probability P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population.

Given the information, we can write the equation as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

1. P(B|A): This is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is 0.8.

2. P(A): This is the probability of the attacker being black in the population. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, this probability is 0.15.

3. P(B): This is the probability of the witness's statement given any attacker (black or white). Since the witness's statement identifies the attacker as black, this probability is equal to the probability of the attacker being black, which is P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15 = 0.8

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
