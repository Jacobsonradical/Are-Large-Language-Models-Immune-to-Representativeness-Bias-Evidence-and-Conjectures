Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black is given as 0.8, and the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is black is given as 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, given no other information, is not provided. However, we do have information about the racial distribution in the city: 15% of the population is black. This can be used as a reasonable prior probability.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, can be estimated as:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

where P(E|A) is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(E|not A) is the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is not black, and P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black.

Using the given values, we can calculate P(E|not A) as 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is not black), and P(not A) as 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives a probability of 0.27 (or 27%).

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.27.
