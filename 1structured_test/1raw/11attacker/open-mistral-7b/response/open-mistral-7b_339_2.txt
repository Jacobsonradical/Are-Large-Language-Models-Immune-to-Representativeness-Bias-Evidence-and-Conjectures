To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of observing B given that A is true. This is provided in the information: the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time when the attacker is black.
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's statement.
- P(B) is the probability of observing B, which is provided in the information: 85% of the population is white.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = [0.8 * P(Attacker is black)] / [0.85 * P(Attacker is black) + 0.15 * P(Attacker is not black)]

We don't know the exact value of P(Attacker is black), but we can make an assumption based on the city's demographics provided in the information. If 85% of the population is white, then 15% must be black. Therefore, P(Attacker is black) = 0.15.

Substituting this value into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(Attacker is black | Witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This means that despite the witness's statement, the evidence still suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white than black.
