Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, we are interested in P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.8, based on the information provided.
2. P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is what we want to find.
3. P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which is a combination of the probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) and the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a black person (1 - P(A|A)) and the probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(A)) and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black (P(A|~A)).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(A) = 0.15. Also, P(~A) = 0.85 (since the total population is 100%).

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.2, based on the information provided.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.182
P(B) = 0.302

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.302
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.232

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.2%.
