Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial distribution of the city's population and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, we also know that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness's error rate, which is 20%, applies to this specific situation.

Now, let's consider the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error:

If the attacker is actually white (the correct classification), the witness would incorrectly identify him as black 20% of the time. This is the error rate we know from the witness's ability to judge race.

On the other hand, if the attacker is black (the incorrect classification), the witness would correctly identify him as black 80% of the time (given that this is the correct classification rate for the witness).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black:

{probability: 0.8, the witness's correct rate of identifying black people}
