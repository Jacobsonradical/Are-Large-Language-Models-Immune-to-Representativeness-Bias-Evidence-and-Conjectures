To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is written as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down the terms:

1. P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would testify that the attacker is black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 in the information.
3. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the proportion of black people in the city, which is given as 0.15 (15%) in the information.
4. P(E) is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H represents not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2. The weighted sum is (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.12 / 0.29
        â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the witness's testimony and the information about the racial makeup of the city, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
