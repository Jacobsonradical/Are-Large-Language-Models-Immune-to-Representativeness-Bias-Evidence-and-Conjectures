To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (irrelevant for our calculation)

Given the information provided, we have:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E), so we'll ignore it for now.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black as:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / 1

P(H|E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 1

P(H|E) ≈ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. This is significantly lower than the witness's testimony, suggesting that the witness may have been biased or incorrect in their identification. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the limited information provided. In a real-world investigation, more evidence would be needed to make a definitive conclusion.
