To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the information)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the information)
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is white (1 - P(A))
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as black (which can be calculated using the probabilities above)

We are given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(~A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

We are also given the witness's ability to judge a person's race. Half of the time, the witness sees a white person, and half of the time, the witness sees a black person. If the witness sees a white person, they incorrectly identify that person as black 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2. If the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify that person as black 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Finally, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.414 or 41.4%.
