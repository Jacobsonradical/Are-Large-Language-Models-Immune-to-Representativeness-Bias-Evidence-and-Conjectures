Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% under similar conditions. This means that even if the attacker was actually white (which makes up the majority of the population), there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistake them for black.
3. On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time.
4. The witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was white, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would make an error and identify them as black. Since the witness did not make this error, it suggests that the attacker is likely to be black.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the sum of the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them, plus the probability that the attacker is white but the witness mistakenly identifies them as black, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is white.
6. Mathematically, this can be represented as: P(Attacker is black) = P(Attacker is black and Witness correctly identifies) + P(Attacker is white and Witness mistakenly identifies)
   P(Attacker is black and Witness correctly identifies) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (15% chance of an attacker being black, and 80% chance of being correctly identified)
   P(Attacker is white and Witness mistakenly identifies) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (85% chance of an attacker being white, and 20% chance of being mistakenly identified as black)
   P(Attacker is black) = 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.184 or 18.4% (rounded to two decimal places)

In summary, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 18.4%. This estimate takes into account both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.
