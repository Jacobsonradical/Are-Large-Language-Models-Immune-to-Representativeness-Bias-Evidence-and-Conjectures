Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as black. This error should be factored into our estimation.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We also know that the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black is 20%.

Given this error, the actual probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black, is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness not making a mistake. This can be written as:

P(witness says black | attacker is black) = P(black) * (1 - 0.2)

On the other hand, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is the probability of the witness making a mistake. This can be written as:

P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up the following equation:

P(witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(white)

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(witness says black) = (0.15 * (1 - 0.2)) + (0.85 * 0.2)

Performing the multiplication and addition, we find that P(witness says black) = 0.18

Recall that P(witness says black) is equal to the sum of two probabilities:

1. The probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black
2. The probability of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black

Since the witness made an error, the first probability is less than the second. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is less than 0.18.

However, without more specific information, we cannot provide a precise number. Therefore, while we know that the probability of the attacker being black is less than 0.18, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.

{probability: less than 0.18, please note that a more precise number cannot be provided without additional information}
