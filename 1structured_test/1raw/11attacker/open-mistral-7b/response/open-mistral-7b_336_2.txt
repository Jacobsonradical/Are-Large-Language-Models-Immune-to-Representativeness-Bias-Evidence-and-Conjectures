Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E (P(H|E)) can be calculated as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't have directly but can estimate using the population statistics), P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (which we have from the witness's ability), P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (which we can estimate from the witness's error rate), and ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black.

Let's first calculate P(E|H) and P(E|~H):

P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify race)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate)

Next, we need to estimate P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't have direct information about the attacker, we can use the city's population statistics as an approximation. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can estimate P(H) as 0.15 (the probability of drawing a black person from the population).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
               = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
               = 0.12

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
