Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an unbiased estimate, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the city's racial demographics and the witness's reliability.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (given that 85% of the population is white).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is P(black) * 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.17 * (1 - P(black)) = 1

Solving this equation, we find the estimated probability that the attacker is black to be approximately 0.62 or 62%.
