To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the hypothesis before considering any evidence. Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker's race, we can assume that the prior probability is equal to the proportion of blacks in the city, which is 15% (0.15).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the statement given any attacker. Since the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race, P(E) is the same for all races. Given the information that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of correct and incorrect identifications: P(E) = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.241

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 24.1%.
