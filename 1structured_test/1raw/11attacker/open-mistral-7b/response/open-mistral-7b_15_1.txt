To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's racial identification is not 100% reliable, as they err in 20% of their cases. Therefore, even if the attacker is actually white (a 85% chance according to city demographics), there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

On the other hand, if the attacker is black (a 15% chance according to city demographics), the witness is more likely to correctly identify them due to their racial bias, as they correctly identify race 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as p, and the probability of the attacker being white as 1-p.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is white is 0.2 (20% chance of error).
The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is:

p = (probability of correct identification when attacker is black) / (probability of correct identification when attacker is white + probability of correct identification when attacker is black)

p = (0.8) / (0.2 + 0.8)

p = 0.8 / 1.0

p = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
