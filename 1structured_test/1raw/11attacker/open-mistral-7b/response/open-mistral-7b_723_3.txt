Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time in similar conditions, but also made errors 20% of the time.

When the witness incorrectly identified the race, they were more likely to mistake a white person for a black person than the other way around, given the city's racial demographics. To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we should consider both the initial racial composition of the city and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as p. We know that the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is q = 0.2 (given that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race, they are wrong 80% of the time in identifying a white person as black).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 1 - q = 0.8. According to the witness, the attacker is black, so we can write an equation:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says attacker is black) = P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)

Using the given information, we can calculate the values of P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) and P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is white) as follows:

P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is black) = 1 - q = 0.8
P(Witness says attacker is black | Attacker is white) = q

We also know that P(Attacker is white) = 1 - P(Attacker is black) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

Now we can solve the equation for P(Attacker is black):

P(Attacker is black | Witness says attacker is black) = 0.8 * P(Attacker is black) + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(Attacker is black), we get:

P(Attacker is black) â‰ˆ 0.23

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23%.
