To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally likely to be assigning black to a white person or vice versa, then the witness's error rate for misidentifying a black person as white is 20% / 2 = 10%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that, based on the information provided, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, and the actual probability could be different if other factors are not accounted for. For example, if the witness had a bias or if the attacker was wearing clothing that made it difficult to determine race, these factors could influence the probability.
