Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume the attacker is black (event A) and the attacker is white (event B). We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is black.

Given the witness's statements, we know that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (P(A|event observed by witness)). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 (P(not A|event observed by witness)).

The total number of people in the sample is equal to the sum of white and black people, which is 85 + 15 = 100.

Given the population distribution, the probability of the witness observing a black person (P(A)) is 15/100 = 0.15.

The probability of the witness observing a white person (P(not A)) is 85/100 = 0.85.

Now, let's find the probability of the witness making the following observations:

1. Correctly identifying a black person as black: P(A and event observed by witness) = P(A) * P(event observed by witness | A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. Incorrectly identifying a black person as white: P(not A and event observed by witness) = P(not A) * P(event observed by witness | not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Since the witness made an identification, the probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probabilities of the correct identification and the error:

P(A) = P(A and event observed by witness) + P(not A and event observed by witness) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
