To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the event A given the evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence B given the event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making this identification, given any attacker)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12 * 0.8 / 0.12 = 0.67

So, given the evidence and the witness's ability to identify race, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.67 or 67%.
