Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states the probability of an event A given some evidence B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification. We know P(B|A) from the first piece of information (80%), P(A) from the second piece of information (15%), and P(B) (the probability of the witness making the identification) can be calculated using the error rate (20%).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.58 or 58%.
