Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the actual attacker is not black is 0.2 (the error rate).

Now, let's consider the racial makeup of the city. We know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it is more likely that the attacker is actually white, given the city's demographic.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of drawing a black person from the city's population, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. This can be calculated as the ratio of the number of black people to the total number of people, multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, probability of the attacker being black is approximately 3%}
