Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case or if they accurately identified the attacker as black.
3. We do know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
4. Without knowing whether the witness made an error or not, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is black.

Since we cannot make a probability estimate based on the given information with uncertainty, the answer is:
{probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1}
