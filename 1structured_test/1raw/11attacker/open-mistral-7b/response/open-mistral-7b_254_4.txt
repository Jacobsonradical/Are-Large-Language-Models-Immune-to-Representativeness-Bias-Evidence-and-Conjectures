Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is biased towards identifying people as white, with an error rate of 20%. Thus, we would expect the witness to err more often when identifying a black person as white than the other way around.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). According to Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(black) = [P(witness said black | attacker is black) \* P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness said black)]

Using the given information, we can compute the probabilities as follows:

1. P(witness said black | attacker is black) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case)
2. P(attacker is black) = the probability we want to find
3. P(witness said black) = P(witness said black | attacker is black) \* P(attacker is black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) \* P(attacker is white)

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that P(witness said black | attacker is white) = 0.8 (since the witness incorrectly identifies whites as black 80% of the time). Using the given population statistics, we can also assume that P(attacker is white) = 0.85 and P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(witness said black), we get:

P(witness said black) = (1 \* 0.15) + (0.8 \* 0.85) = 0.21

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(black):

P(black) = [1 \* 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.714

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the population statistics, is approximately 0.714 or 71.4%.
