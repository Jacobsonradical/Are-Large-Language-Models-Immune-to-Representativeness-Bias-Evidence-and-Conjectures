Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the population (which is approximately 85% white and 15% black based on information b), we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let's calculate the values for each term in the equation:
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. We are given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is what we want to find.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, we have P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black). Since the population is approximately 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate P(B) as follows:
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.29

We don't have the value of P(A), but we can solve for it:

P(A) = 0.29 * P(A|B) / 0.8

Substituting the known value of P(B|A) = 0.8, we get:

P(A) = 0.29 * 0.8 / 0.8 = 0.21

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.21, or 21%.
