To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Similarly, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.
The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 0.97.

Therefore, {probability: 0.97} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
