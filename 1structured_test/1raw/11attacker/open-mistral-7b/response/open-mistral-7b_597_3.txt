To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time, and there are equal numbers of white and black people in the sample, this suggests that the witness's error rate is equally likely for both races. In other words, the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time and mistakenly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.

However, in the city where the attack occurred, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that there are more white people than black people in the city.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

1. The witness made a type I error (mistakenly identifying a white person as black).
2. The witness made a type II error (correctly identifying the attacker as black, but this being a rare event due to the city's racial composition).

Let's calculate the probabilities for these two scenarios.

1. Type I error: Since 85% of the population is white and the witness incorrectly identifies races 20% of the time, the probability of a type I error is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

2. Type II error: Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of a type II error is 0.15.

However, we know that the witness actually identified the attacker as black, so the probability of a type II error is the probability we're interested in.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
