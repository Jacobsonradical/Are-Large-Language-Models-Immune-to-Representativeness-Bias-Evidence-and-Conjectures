Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. We know from information "a" that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. Information "b" tells us that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
3. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, when they identify someone as black, there's a 20% chance they are actually misidentifying a white person.
4. To find the probability that the attacker is truly black, we need to adjust for the witness's error rate.
5. If the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, the attacker is indeed black. In this case, the probability is 80%.
6. If the witness errs and incorrectly identifies a white person as black, the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability is 0, but since we're looking for the probability of the attacker being black, we can ignore this case.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is truly black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, which is 80%.

In dictionary format: {probability: 0.8}
