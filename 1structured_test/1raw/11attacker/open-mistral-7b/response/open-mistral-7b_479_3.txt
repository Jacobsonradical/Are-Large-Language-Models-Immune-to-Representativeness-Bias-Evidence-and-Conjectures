Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is only 80% under similar conditions, with an error rate of 20%.
3. Therefore, even though the majority of the population is white, the witness's identification of the attacker as black should not be automatically discounted, especially considering the conditions under which the witness made the identification (attack at night).

Given this, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person, which is 0.8 (80%). However, since we don't know the actual population size or the number of people the witness observed, this estimate is not strictly based on the information provided. It's an approximation based on the witness's accuracy rate and the racial distribution in the city.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an approximation due to the lack of specific population size or observation data}
