Based on the information provided, the population statistics give us a probability of 0.15 that the attacker is black. However, the witness's testimony suggests a higher probability. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness was correct, given that the attacker is actually black, is 0.8 (80%).

The probability that the witness was incorrect, given that the attacker is actually black, is 0.2 (20%). Since we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can consider the probability of the witness being correct and the probability of the witness being incorrect as two possible scenarios.

The probability of the witness being correct (given that the attacker is actually black) times the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness being incorrect (given that the attacker is actually black) times the probability that the attacker is not black (which is 0.85, given the population statistics) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, and we have two possible scenarios (one in which the witness was correct and one in which the witness was incorrect), we can find this probability by adding these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.29. This is a higher probability than what we would infer from the population statistics alone. However, it's important to note that this estimate is dependent on the accuracy of the witness's testimony, which was not perfect.
