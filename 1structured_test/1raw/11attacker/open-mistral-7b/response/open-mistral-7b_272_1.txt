Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, has an error rate of 20% in identifying race. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.
3. The witness correctly identified the attacker as black in this case.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually white. If the witness errs, there's a 20% chance that they mistakenly identify a white person as black. In this scenario, the actual attacker is white.

However, if the witness is correct, the attacker is indeed black.

Given these two possibilities (witness is correct or witness is incorrect), we can calculate the probabilities and determine the overall probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

We know that P(black) + P(not black) = 1, where P(not black) is the probability that the attacker is white.

We also know that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black with a probability P(witness correct|attacker is black).

Given that the witness has an error rate of 20%, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(witness correct|attacker is black) = 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is black)

Now, let's consider the probability P(witness is correct) when the attacker is actually white (P(witness correct|attacker is not black)). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(witness correct|attacker is not black) = 0.2.

Given that the actual attacker is white with probability P(not black), we can calculate the probability P(witness is correct) as follows:

P(witness is correct) = P(witness correct|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness correct|attacker is not black) * P(attacker is not black)

We know that P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), and P(attacker is not black) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

So, we have:

P(witness is correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can solve for P(attacker is black) using the fact that P(witness is correct) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct in each scenario:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness is correct) / (P(witness correct|attacker is black) + P(witness correct|attacker is not black))

Using the calculated values, we get:

P(attacker is black) = 0.29 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.29 / 1 = 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29, or 29%.
