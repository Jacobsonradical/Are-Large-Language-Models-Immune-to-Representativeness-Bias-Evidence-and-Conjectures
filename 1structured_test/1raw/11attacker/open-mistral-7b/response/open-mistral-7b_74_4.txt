Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 80% or 0.8.
3. P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which can be calculated by subtracting P(B|A) from 1, giving 0.2.
4. P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is given as 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which is the weighted sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A) multiplied by their respective probabilities, P(A) and P(~A): P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 57.1%.
