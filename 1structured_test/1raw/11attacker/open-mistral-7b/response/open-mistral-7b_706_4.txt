Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15 or 0.150.

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness making the identification. Since the witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

4. P(H|E) is what we are trying to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          = 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.414 or 41.4%. This means that, given the witness's identification, there is a 41.4% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on certain assumptions, and more information or a different model could lead to a different estimate.
