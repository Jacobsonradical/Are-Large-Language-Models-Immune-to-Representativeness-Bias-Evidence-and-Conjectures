Given the information provided, we have a witness who is able to correctly identify race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have any direct evidence that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is correct.

Given the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black), we can calculate the probability of a random person being black. This is simply the proportion of the population that is black:

{probability: 0.15}

However, this does not take into account the witness's ability to correctly identify race, which, as we stated, is 80%. To account for this, we should adjust the probabilities accordingly.

Let's assume that the witness's identification is correct. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black is 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as black).

On the other hand, if the witness's identification is incorrect, then the probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of the population that is black, which is 0.15.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification is correct is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is:

0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.024 = 0.824

Therefore, our adjusted estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.824. This means that, given the witness's identification and the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we estimate that there is an 82.4% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical estimate based on the provided information. In a real-world situation, further evidence and investigation would be necessary to draw a definitive conclusion.
