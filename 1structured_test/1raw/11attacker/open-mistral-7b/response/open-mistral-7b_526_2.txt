Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black with a probability of 20%. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness sees the attacker in the dark and mistakes happen, we can assume that the witness's "true" belief about the attacker's race is a weighted average of their belief (0.8) and their error (0.2). Let's call this weight w:

w \* 0.8 + (1 - w) \* 0.2 = 0.8

Rearranging the equation to solve for w, we get:

w = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 1

However, this result implies that the witness's belief in the attacker's race is equal to the actual frequency of black people in the city, which contradicts the 80% accuracy rate given. This suggests that the witness's belief is influenced by more factors than just their accuracy in racial identification, such as prejudice or prior assumptions.

Since we can't accurately determine the weight w, we can't provide a precise probability for the attacker being black. Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please consider revising the question or assumptions}
