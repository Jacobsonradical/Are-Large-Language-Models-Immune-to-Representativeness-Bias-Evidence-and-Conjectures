Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black. The evidence is the witness's statement about the attacker's race.

Let's denote:

- H: The attacker is black
- ~H: The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We know the prior probability of H (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence), which is given by the population statistics: P(H) = 0.15.

We also know the conditional probability of E given H (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is indeed black), which is provided as 0.8.

We don't have direct information about P(E | ~H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to infer this from the provided information.

The theorem states that P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / [P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)].

Since we don't have P(E | ~H), we can use the given information to find an equivalent expression for it:

1. P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker not being black)
2. P(E | ~H) = 1 - P(~E | ~H) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (the probability of the witness misidentifying a white attacker as black)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.8) * (0.85)]

Calculating this value, we find that:

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.27

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.27. This means that, based on the given information, we would assign a probability of about 27% to the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
