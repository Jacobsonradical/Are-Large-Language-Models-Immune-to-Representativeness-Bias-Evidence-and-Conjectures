Given the information provided, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the attacker's race since the attack occurred in the dark, and the witness was not able to see the race of the attacker. However, we can use the population statistics to make an educated guess.

The witness's accuracy rate is not relevant in this case because the witness's ability to correctly identify race under normal conditions does not apply to a situation where the race cannot be seen.

Therefore, based on the city's population statistics:
{probability: 0.15, the attacker is estimated to be black since 15% of the city's population is black}
