To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H0: The attacker is white
- H1: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's description of the attacker as black

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (P(E|H1)) is given in the information as 0.8. The probability of the witness making an incorrect identification (P(E|H0)) is given as 1 - P(E|H1) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

The prior probabilities of the attacker being white (P(H0)) and black (P(H1)) are given in the information as 0.85 and 0.15, respectively.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's description:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.218

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.218 or 21.8%.
