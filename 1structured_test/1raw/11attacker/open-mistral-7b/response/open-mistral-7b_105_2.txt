Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H0 as the hypothesis that the attacker is white
- H1 as the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E as the evidence, which is the witness's identification of the attacker as black

We have two prior probabilities:
- P(H0) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
- P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

And a likelihood ratio:
- P(E|H0) = 0.2 (The witness erred in identifying the attacker as black 20% of the time)
- P(E|H1) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)

We can now calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(H0|E) = P(E|H0) * P(H0) / (P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1))
P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / (P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1))

Calculating the values:

P(H0|E) ≈ 0.18
P(H1|E) ≈ 0.82

So, based on the given information and assuming that the witness's ability to judge a person's race under the given conditions is representative, the attacker is estimated to be black approximately 82% of the time.
