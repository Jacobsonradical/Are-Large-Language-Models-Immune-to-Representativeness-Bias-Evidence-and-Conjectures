The information provided suggests that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is not very reliable in identifying race (correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time) has stated that the attacker is black.

The witness's error rate of 20% means that they might have mistakenly identified an attacker as black when they were actually white. To account for this, we can consider the probability of the witness making a mistake and attributing the attack to a black person, even if the attacker was actually white.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifying a black attacker would mean that the attacker is indeed black. Given that 15% of the city's population is black, the probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3%.

Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black: 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20 or 20%. However, since the witness's reliability in race identification is low, this estimate should be considered as a rough estimate and not a definitive answer.
