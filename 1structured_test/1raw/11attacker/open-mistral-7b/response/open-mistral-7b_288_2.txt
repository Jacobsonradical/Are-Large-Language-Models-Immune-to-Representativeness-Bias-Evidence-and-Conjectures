The provided information suggests that the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. However, we only know the witness's accuracy in general and not specifically for situations where they are unable to see the person's race clearly.

Given that the witness misidentified the attacker's race in this case, it could mean they made an error, or it could mean that the attacker was indeed black but the witness couldn't see it clearly enough to make a correct identification. Without more specific information about the witness's performance in such situations, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested dictionary format. It would require additional data or assumptions to make an informed estimate.
