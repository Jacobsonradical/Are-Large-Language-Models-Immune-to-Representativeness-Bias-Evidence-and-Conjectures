Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any information about the probability that the actual attacker was black, given the racial distribution in the city.

To make an estimate, we can assume that the witness's error rate is equally distributed between incorrectly identifying a black person as white and incorrectly identifying a white person as black. In other words, if there were an equal number of white and black people, the witness would mistake 10% of each group.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. If we assume that the witness's error rate is applied evenly, then the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 0.10 * 0.85 = 0.085 (or 8.5%).

Conversely, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since we don't have any other information, our best estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 12%. However, this estimate is likely to be inaccurate due to the lack of information and the assumption that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed.
