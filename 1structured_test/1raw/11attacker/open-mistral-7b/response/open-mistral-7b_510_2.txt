To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are evenly distributed between the two races (which is not necessarily the case, but it's a reasonable initial assumption), then the witness misidentifies a black person as white 10% of the time (20% error rate / 2).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15 (or 15%). However, the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white 10% of the time, which means that the true proportion of black attackers is actually higher than 0.15.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is 0.8 (80%). Since the witness errs in identifying a black person as white 10% of the time, the actual proportion of black attackers is 0.8 / (1 - 0.1) = 0.88 (88%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.88}.
