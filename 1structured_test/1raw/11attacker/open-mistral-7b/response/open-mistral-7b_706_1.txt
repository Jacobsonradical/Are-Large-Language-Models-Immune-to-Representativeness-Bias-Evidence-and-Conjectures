Given the information provided, we can calculate the likelihood of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

The witness's reliability is 80% for correctly identifying race, and the error rate is 20%. This means that the probability of the witness making a mistake and misidentifying a white person as black is 20%.

Since 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black, there are more white people in the city. If the witness mistakes a white person for a black person, this would increase the estimated proportion of black attackers.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement and the city's demographics:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%). Since there are more white people in the city, this is a significant error that increases the estimated proportion of black attackers.

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we need to consider both scenarios:
- The actual attacker is black (probability 0.15), and the witness correctly identifies him as such: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
- The actual attacker is white (probability 0.85), but the witness incorrectly identifies him as black: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Adding these two probabilities gives us the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement and the city's demographics: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
