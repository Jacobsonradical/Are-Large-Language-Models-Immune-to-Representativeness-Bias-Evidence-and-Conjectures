Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

If the witness saw the attacker and identified them as black, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black. We have the following probabilities:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (given in the information b).
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is actually black. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This probability is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (P(A) * P(B|A)) and incorrectly identifying a white attacker (P(not A) * P(B|not A)). Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(B|not A) is 0.2. The probability of not A (the attacker being white) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85. So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.68.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.134

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 13.4%.
