To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance they made a mistake. This means there's a 80% chance that they correctly identified the attacker's race.

However, the witness's incorrect identifications are not evenly distributed between the two races. In a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we would expect the witness to mistakenly identify a white person as black much more often than a black person as white, due to the city's racial demographics.

Let's calculate the expected number of errors for each race, given the witness's error rate and the city's racial demographics.

If the attacker is white:
- The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time.
- In the city, there are 85 white people for every 15 black people.
- So, the expected number of errors in identifying white people as black is 0.2 * (85/100) = 0.17.

If the attacker is black:
- The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.
- In the city, there are 15 black people for every 85 white people.
- So, the expected number of errors in identifying black people as white is 0.2 * (15/85) = 0.03.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we should consider the 0.03 expected errors for identifying black people as white as a "success" in this case.

The total number of errors the witness makes is the sum of the expected number of errors for each race. So, the total number of errors is 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20.

This means that there's a 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, and a 0.20 probability that they made a mistake.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, and we know that they are correct in 80% of their race identifications, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of a correct identification given that the witness said it was black: 0.80.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.80}.
