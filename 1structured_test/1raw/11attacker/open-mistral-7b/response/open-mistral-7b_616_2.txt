Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this specific case.

In a fair scenario, we would expect the attacker's race to be reflective of the city's population. Given that 85% of the city's population is white, we might initially assume that the attacker is likely to be white. But considering the witness's error rate, it's possible that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

To make an estimate, we could consider a hypothetical scenario where the attacker's race was known and the witness made an error. In this scenario, we would adjust the population proportions to account for the witness's error. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a precise number.

Therefore, I must qualify my answer as an approximate estimate: {probability: around 0.15, with a significant margin of error due to the lack of direct observational evidence and the witness's potential error rate}
