Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness identifying a non-black person as black, given that the attacker is not black.
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black.

From the information given, we know:
P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
P(~B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.167

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 16.7%.
