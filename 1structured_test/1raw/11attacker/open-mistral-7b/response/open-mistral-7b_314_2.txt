After considering the two pieces of information provided, we can make an estimate using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know the following:

1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = Probability that the witness misidentifies a non-black person as black = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
4. P(A|B) = The probability we are trying to find
5. P(B) = Total probability of the witness identifying any person as black = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.44

So, our estimate based on the provided information is that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.44 or 44%.
