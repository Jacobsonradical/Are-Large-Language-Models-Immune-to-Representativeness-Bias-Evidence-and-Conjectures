Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: 1) 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. 2) A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B). Since the witness is biased towards identifying people as black, we need to account for this bias.

If the attacker was actually white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying him as black is 0.2 (20% error rate). So, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 (the probability of a white person being present).

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's statement, is P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 * (1 - 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.179 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

However, we know that the actual probability of a white person being present is 0.85. So, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is P(statement|W) = 0.179.

The probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is P(statement|B) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|statement) = P(statement|B) * P(B) / (P(statement|B) * P(B) + P(statement|W) * P(W)) = 1 * 0.15 / (1 * 0.15 + 0.179 * 0.85) = 0.143 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.143.
