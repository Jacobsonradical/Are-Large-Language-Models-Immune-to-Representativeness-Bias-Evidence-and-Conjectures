Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's description).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case:
- H is the attacker being black
- E is the witness's description of the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify race)
- P(H) = 0.15 (from the population demographics)
- P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (calculated by multiplying the true positive rate by the proportion of black people and the false positive rate by the proportion of white people)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
