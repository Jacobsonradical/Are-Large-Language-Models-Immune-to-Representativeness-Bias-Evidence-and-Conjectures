To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that A is true given that B is true. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given in the first piece of information as 0.8.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black. This is the quantity we want to estimate.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as black. This is a combination of P(A) and the error rate of the witness, which is given in the first piece of information as 0.2.

We can rewrite P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Since the witness is correct half the time, we can assume that they are incorrect the other half of the time.
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not black. This is 1 - P(A).

The value of P(B|not A) can be found using the principle of total probability:

P(B|not A) = P(B and not A) / P(not A)

Since the witness is incorrect half the time, we can assume that they are incorrect when identifying non-black people as black half the time as well. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we have all the values needed to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the prior probability of the attacker being black is P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.54

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 54%.
