To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence (the witness's testimony)

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, we have:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we don't know
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness reporting "black" given that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.8 in the problem
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness reporting "black" given that the attacker is not black, which is the complement of P(E|H)
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H)
- P(E): the probability of the witness reporting "black", which is the sum of the two probabilities above

We are given that P(H) * P(E|H) = 0.8 * P(H), and P(~H) * P(E|~H) = 0.2 * P(~H). From this, we can express P(H) and P(~H) in terms of each other:

P(H) = P(E|H) / (P(E|H) + P(E|~H))
P(~H) = P(E|~H) / (P(E|H) + P(E|~H))

Since 85% of the population is white, P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is white. We are given that P(~H) = 0.85, so we can find P(H):

P(H) = P(E|H) / (P(E|H) + P(E|~H)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1.0 = 0.8

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8, or 80%.
