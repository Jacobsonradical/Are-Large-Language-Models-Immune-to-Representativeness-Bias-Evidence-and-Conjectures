To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, even if the attacker was actually white. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is black by multiplying the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race with the probability of the attacker being black in the city.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%).
The probability that the attacker is black in the city is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12.
