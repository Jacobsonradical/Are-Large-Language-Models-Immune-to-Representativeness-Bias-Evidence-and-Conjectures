Given the information provided, the probability estimate would be calculated as follows:

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and their error rate is 20%. Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's mistake in this specific case was an error or an accurate identification, we will assume a 50-50 split between correct and incorrect identifications.

The witness identified the attacker as black. If we assume a 50% chance that this identification was correct, then the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.5 (or 50%).

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This information suggests that the probability of the attacker being black in the general population is 15%.

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness's identification was accurate or not, the best estimate would be to use the prior probability of the attacker being black in the general population, which is 15%.

Therefore, the probability estimate is {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
