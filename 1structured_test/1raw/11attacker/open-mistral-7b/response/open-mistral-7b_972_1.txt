Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Since we do not have any other information that could influence the attacker's race, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the attacker being black and B represents the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

We can rewrite the equation as:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * P(not A))

We are given P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (since the population is 85% white).

Using the given witness's ability to correctly identify race (P(B|A) = 0.8), we can now estimate the probability of the attacker being black (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
