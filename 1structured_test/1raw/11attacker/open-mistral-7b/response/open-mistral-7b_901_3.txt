Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% erroneous. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's reliability and the city's population distribution. Since the witness can't always accurately determine race, we need to adjust the city's population proportion to account for their errors.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is actually R (either black or white). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is R, and the probability that they incorrectly identify a white person as black is (1-R)*0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be true in two ways:
1) The attacker is actually black (R=1), and the witness correctly identifies R.
2) The attacker is white (R=0), but the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black.

The probability of the first case is R, and the probability of the second case is (1-R)*0.85. Since these are the only two ways the witness's statement can be true, the total probability that the witness's statement is true is R + (1-R)*0.85.

However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is black (R=1), given the witness's statement. This is called the conditional probability, and it can be calculated as the probability that the witness's statement is true when the attacker is black, divided by the total probability that the witness's statement is true:

P(R=1 | witness's statement) = P(witness's statement and R=1) / P(witness's statement)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated earlier, we get:

P(R=1 | witness's statement) = (R) / (R + (1-R)*0.85)

Since we don't know the exact value of R, we can't provide a specific number as the probability. However, we can rearrange the equation to solve for R:

R = P(R=1 | witness's statement) * (R + (1-R)*0.85)

R - P(R=1 | witness's statement) * R = P(R=1 | witness's statement) * 0.85

R(1 - P(R=1 | witness's statement)) = 0.85 * P(R=1 | witness's statement)

R = 0.85 / (1 - P(R=1 | witness's statement))

This equation allows us to find the value of R given any estimate of P(R=1 | witness's statement). However, without more information, we can't provide a specific value for P(R=1 | witness's statement) or R.
