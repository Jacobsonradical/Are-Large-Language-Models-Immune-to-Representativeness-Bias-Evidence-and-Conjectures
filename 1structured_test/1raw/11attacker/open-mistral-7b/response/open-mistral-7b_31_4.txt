To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is our estimate (to be found)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness identifying a person as black), which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where P(E|~H) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H))

We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, so P(~H) = 0.15 and P(H) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Now, we can find P(H|E) by solving the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 = 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.4 or 40%.
