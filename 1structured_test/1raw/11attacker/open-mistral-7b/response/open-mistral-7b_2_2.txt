To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to know if the witness's error rate is the same for identifying black people as white people. If it is, then the witness's error rate is added to the proportion of the population that is white (85% in this case).

If the witness's error rate is not the same for both races, we would need more information to make a more accurate estimate.

Given the limited information, we can make a rough estimate by assuming the witness's error rate is the same for both races. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be the proportion of the population that is black, adjusted for the witness's error rate.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%) times 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12, or 12%.

However, this is a very rough estimate and could be significantly different if the witness's error rate for identifying black people is higher or lower than their error rate for identifying white people. If more information is available, a more accurate estimate could be made.
