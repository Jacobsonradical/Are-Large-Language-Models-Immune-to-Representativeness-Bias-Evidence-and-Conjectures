To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

1. According to the information provided, 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness, however, is not perfectly reliable. They correctly identify race 80% of the time but err 20% of the time.

When we combine these two pieces of information, we can think of the witness's identification as a random event with two possible outcomes: correct identification or error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, this counts as a successful identification (correct or error).

The probability that the attacker is actually black (P(black|attack_description)) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

a) Probability of a black attacker (P(black)): 15%

b) Probability of a white attacker (P(white)): 85%

c) Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (P(correct|black)): 0.8 (from the text)

d) Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black (P(false positive|white)): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time and there is an 85% chance of a white attacker)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the event "witness identifies attacker as black" given that the attacker is black (P(attack_description|black)) and given that the attacker is white (P(attack_description|white)):

e) P(attack_description|black) = P(correct|black) = 0.8

f) P(attack_description|white) = P(false positive|white) = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's description:

g) P(black|attack_description) = [P(black) * P(attack_description|black)] / [P(black) * P(attack_description|black) + P(white) * P(attack_description|white)]

g = (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17)

g = 0.12 / 0.1895 â‰ˆ 0.63

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.63 or 63%.
