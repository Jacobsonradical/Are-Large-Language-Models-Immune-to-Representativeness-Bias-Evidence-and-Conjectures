Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

1. The demographic information about the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify races: the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There's a chance that the witness made an error in their identification.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we should consider both the demographic information and the witness's error rate. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

Given the demographic information, P(black) = 0.15 (15%).

Given the witness's error rate, if the attacker was actually white, the witness would mistakenly identify him as black with a probability of 0.2 (20%). Therefore, the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness identified him as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the attacker is either black or white, we can write a Bayes' theorem-like equation:

P(black|witness's ID) = [P(witness's ID|black) * P(black)] / [P(witness's ID|black) * P(black) + P(witness's ID|white) * P(white)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(black|witness's ID) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
