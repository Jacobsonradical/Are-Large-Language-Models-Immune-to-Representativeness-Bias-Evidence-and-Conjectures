Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let's break this down:
1. H: The attacker is black
2. E: The witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (from information "a").

The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (given in information "b"). Let's call this p(E|H).

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (given in information "b"). Let's call this p(E|~H).

The probability of the witness identifying a random person as black is 0.5 (half of the people are black, so the probability of picking a black person is 0.5). Let's call this p(E).

Now we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:

p(H|E) = [p(E|H) * p(H)] / p(E)

Substituting the values:

p(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.5

p(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 12%.
