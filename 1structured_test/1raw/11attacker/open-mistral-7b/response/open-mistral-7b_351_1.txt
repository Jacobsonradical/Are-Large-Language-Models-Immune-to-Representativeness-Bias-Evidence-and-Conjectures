Given the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not always reliable in identifying race, has identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

If we assume that the witness's errors are uniformly distributed (i.e., they are just as likely to mistake a white person for black as a black person for white), then the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is a mistake (i.e., the attacker is actually white) is 20%.

But we also know that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is black in the population. So, if the witness's identification is a mistake, it must be because they mistakenly identified a white person as black. In this case, the actual attacker is still white.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is not simply the probability that the attacker is black in the population, but rather the probability that the attacker is black in the population, minus the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black.

The probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black is the same as the probability that the witness would correctly identify a black person as black, which is 80%. So, the probability that the witness's identification is a mistake due to mistaking a white person as black is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.15 - 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.0425, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that, given the information, it is estimated that there is a 4.25% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions, and in a real-world situation, other factors and evidence would likely be considered.
