Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race under specific conditions: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's statement that the attacker was black increases our belief that the attacker is indeed black. However, we need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error in their observation.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as black is 20% (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
2. If the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying them as black is 80%.

Given that the total population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probabilities of each scenario:

1. If the attacker is white: P(attacker is white) = 0.85
   P(witness's mistake | attacker is white) = 0.20
   P(attacker is white and witness's mistake) = P(attacker is white) * P(witness's mistake | attacker is white)
   = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

2. If the attacker is black: P(attacker is black) = 0.15
   P(witness correctly identified attacker | attacker is black) = 0.80
   P(attacker is black and witness correctly identified) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identified attacker | attacker is black)
   = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

Now, we can calculate the total probability of the witness's statement being correct, considering both scenarios:

P(witness's statement is correct) = P(attacker is white and witness's mistake) + P(attacker is black and witness correctly identified)
                                       = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Since the witness's statement cannot be both correct and incorrect, we need to subtract the double-counted probability:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness's statement is correct) - P(attacker is white and witness's mistake)
                        = 0.29 - 0.17 = 0.12

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
