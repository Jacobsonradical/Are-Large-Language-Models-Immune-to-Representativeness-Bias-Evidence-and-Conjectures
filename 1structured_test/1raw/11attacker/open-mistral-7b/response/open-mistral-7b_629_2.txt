To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is random within the city population, then the probability that the witness makes an error when identifying the attacker's race is equal to the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakes them for black.

Given that 85% of the city population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. The witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakes them for black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as black, and there is a 17% chance that the attacker is white and the witness mistakes them for black, the probability that the actual attacker is black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

Here is the answer in the requested dictionary format: {probability: 0.83}
