Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker is either white or black. The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The witness correctly identified the attacker as black in this case. The probability of this happening if the attacker is actually black is 1 (since the attacker is indeed black in this scenario).

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies black people as white 20% of the time. If the attacker is actually white, the probability that the witness will still incorrectly identify him as black is this 20% error rate.

So, the probability that the witness made a correct identification given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (the error rate).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's incorrect identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.46875 or 46.88%.
