To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can assume that when they see a black person, they correctly identify it as such 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify it as black 20% of the time (since they err 20% of the time overall). So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the proportion of black people in the population. From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is black. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black. Since she correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, we have P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

4. Now we can calculate P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
