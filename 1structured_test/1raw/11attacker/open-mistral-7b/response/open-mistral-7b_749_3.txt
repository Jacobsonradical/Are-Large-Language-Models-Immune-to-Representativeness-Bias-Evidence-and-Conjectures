To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification and population statistics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H):
The witness identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when the person was actually black. So, P(E|H) = 0.8

Next, calculate P(H):
Since we don't have any prior information about the attacker's race, we can assume that the prior probability is equal to the population proportion. So, P(H) = 0.15

Now, calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
P(E|not H) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|not H) = 0.2
P(not H) is the probability that the attacker is white. P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
