Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's testimony that the attacker was black should be weighed against their error rate. If the witness's identification of the attacker's race was based on reliable information, then their statement is likely to be accurate. If it was based on unreliable information, then their statement is likely to be an error.

The probability that the attacker is black can be estimated by multiplying the probability that the witness made an accurate identification by the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the racial demographics of the city.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(E|A) be the probability that the witness makes a correct identification when the attacker is black. Let P(E|not A) be the probability that the witness makes a correct identification when the attacker is not black.

Then, we have:

P(A) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / [P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|not A) \* P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
