To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen, there is a chance that the witness might have made an error. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black).

The witness identifies the attacker as black. However, due to the witness's error rate, there is a chance that the witness made an incorrect identification. The probability of this happening is the error rate, which is 0.20 (or 20%).

On the other hand, there is also a chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. This probability is the complement of the error rate, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (or 80%).

Given that the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and the population is 85% white, we can assume that the witness correctly identifies a white person 80% * 0.85 = 0.68 (or 68%) of the time.

However, the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, which is equivalent to incorrectly identifying a black person as white 20% * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%) of the time.

Since the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, and the population is 15% black, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%) of the time.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, and the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 3% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually white is 0.03.

Since the probability of a random person being white is 0.85, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black is the probability of the attacker being black divided by the probability of a random person being white, which is (P(black))/(1-P(white)) = (P(black))/0.85.

Given that the probability of a random person being black is 0.15, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 3%, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black is (0.15)/(1 - 0.03) = 0.1538 or 15.38%.

However, since the witness has a 20% error rate, we should consider the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error is 0.20, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given that the probability of a random person being black is 0.15, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.80, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black and the witness did not make an error is (0.15)/0.80 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.

Given that the probability of the witness making an error is 0.20, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80, the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identifies the attacker as black is (0.1875 * 0.80) + (0.1538 * 0.20) = 0.148 or 14.8%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is between 14.8% and 15.38%.
