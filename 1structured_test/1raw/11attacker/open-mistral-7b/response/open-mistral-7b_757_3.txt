Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black, as the witness could have made an error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the updated probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, the hypothesis is H = attacker is black, and the evidence is E = witness identified attacker as black.

We are given P(E | H) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black), P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black), and P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race).

So, the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.16] = 0.4375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.44 or 44%.
