Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black.
3. The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (from information b).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 (from information b).

Given that the population is 85% white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies this white person as black is 0.2.

So, the probability of observing a scenario where the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since we are given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this scenario must correspond to either the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying him (0.8 probability) or the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying him (0.17 probability).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the first scenario plus half of the probability of the second scenario:

(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.5 * (0.17) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.
