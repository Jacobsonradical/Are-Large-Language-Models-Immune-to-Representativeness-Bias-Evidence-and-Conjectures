Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the attacker was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's reliability data to make an estimate. But we can use the population data to make an educated guess.

In this case, given that 85% of the population is white and the attacker could have been any race, it might initially seem that the probability of the attacker being black is only 15% (since the attacker could not have been white in this case).

But considering the witness's ability to correctly identify race 80% of the time, and given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we might want to adjust our initial estimate. However, without more information, we cannot quantify this adjustment accurately.

Therefore, while we cannot provide a strict numerical probability between 0 and 1, we can suggest that based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics, there might be a higher probability than the initial 15% that the attacker is black. But without more specific information, it's impossible to provide a precise number.
