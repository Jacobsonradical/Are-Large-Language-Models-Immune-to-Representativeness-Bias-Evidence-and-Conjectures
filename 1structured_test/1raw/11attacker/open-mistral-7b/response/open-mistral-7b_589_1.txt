Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, P(E|H) is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 0.8 (80%). P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (15%). P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can be calculated using the witness's overall accuracy and the proportion of black and white people in the city.

Since the witness identifies black people correctly in 80% of cases and errs in 20% of cases, and there are 85% white people and 15% black people, we can calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.25

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
