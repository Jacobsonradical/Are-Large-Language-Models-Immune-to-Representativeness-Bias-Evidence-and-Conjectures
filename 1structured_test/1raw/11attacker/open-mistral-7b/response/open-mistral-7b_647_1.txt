To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's race
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black

We know that P(B) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black) and P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate for blacks) and P(W|not B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate for non-blacks).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the attacker must be either black (B) or the witness made an error (not B). We can set up a Bayes' theorem problem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B))

Now, we can plug in the given values:

P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
