Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's identification.

1. According to the demographics, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness, who has an accuracy of 80% in identifying race, identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider these two pieces of information together. The witness's identification could be a true indication of the attacker's race (80% chance) or an error (20% chance). If the identification is an error, then the attacker is likely white (given the city's demographics).

However, we don't have enough information to quantify the probability of the witness's identification being an error in this specific case. Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate.

To make a more precise estimate, you would need additional information, such as the witness's certainty in their identification, any physical descriptors given by the witness, or other evidence that could help corroborate or contradict the witness's statement.
