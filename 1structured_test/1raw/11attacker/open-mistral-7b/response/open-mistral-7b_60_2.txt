To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

From the information provided, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

If we assume that the witness's racial identification is independent of the actual race of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This probability is the product of the witness's accuracy rate and the proportion of black people in the city:

P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) = witness accuracy rate * proportion of black people
                                                                                  = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                                                  = 0.12

Since the attacker's race is unknown, we should also consider the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white. This probability is the product of the witness's error rate and the proportion of white people in the city:

P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is white) = witness error rate * proportion of white people
                                                                                      = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                                                      = 0.17

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the ratio of the former probability to the sum of the former and the latter probabilities:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) / (P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) + P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is white))
                                     = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                     â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
