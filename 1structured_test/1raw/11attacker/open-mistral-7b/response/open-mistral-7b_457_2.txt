Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H: attacker is black) given the evidence (E: witness's identification), which we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is given as 0.15 (85% of the city's population is white, so 15% is black).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is not black (P(~H) = 0.85, and P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the race 20% of the time when the person was not black, which is not provided in the information).

Since we don't have the necessary information to calculate P(E), we cannot strictly provide a numerical estimate for P(H|E). However, we can still provide an estimation based on the information provided. Given that the witness's ability to judge race is not perfect and that the city's population is majority white, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be white. Therefore, our estimate would be that the probability of the attacker being black is less than 0.15.
