Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographics.

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
3. Since we don't know if the witness's error was in this case, we should consider both possibilities:
   a) The witness correctly identified the race, in which case the attacker is indeed black.
   b) The witness made an error, in which case the attacker could be either white or black.
4. In case b), we know that the witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness erring and calling a white person black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%). The probability of the witness erring and calling a black person white is also 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03 (3%).
5. Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the probability of the witness erring and mistakenly identifying a black person as white is actually higher than the probability of erring and identifying a white person as black. Therefore, we can assume that in most, if not all, cases where the witness errs, they would identify a black person as white.
6. So, in case b), we can effectively treat the attacker as white for the purpose of calculating the probability.
7. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of their identification being correct is 0.80 (80%).
8. Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black is the product of the witness's reliability and their correct identification, which is 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68 (68%).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.68 or 68%.
