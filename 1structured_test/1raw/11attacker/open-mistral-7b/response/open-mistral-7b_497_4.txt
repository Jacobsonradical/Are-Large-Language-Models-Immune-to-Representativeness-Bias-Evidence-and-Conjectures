To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

1. The witness's identification is not always accurate, as they correctly identify race only 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.
2. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

To incorporate both pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- W: The witness's identification of the attacker as black

The probability of the witness's identification being correct when the attacker is black is P(W|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy statistics).
The probability of the witness's identification being correct when the attacker is white is P(W|~H) = 0 (it's impossible, as the witness identified the attacker as black).

The probability of the attacker being black is P(H), and the probability of the attacker being white is P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.15 (from the city's racial makeup).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0 \* 0.85]

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 12%.
