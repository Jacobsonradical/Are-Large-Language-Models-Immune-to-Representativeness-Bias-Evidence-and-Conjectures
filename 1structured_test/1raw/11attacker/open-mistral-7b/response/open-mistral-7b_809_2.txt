To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

1. According to the given information, 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% in favorable conditions, but there is also a 20% chance of error.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this a successful identification if the attacker was indeed black. However, if the attacker was white, the witness would have made an error. The probability of the witness making a correct identification (P(correct)) is then the product of the probability of the attacker being black (P(attacker is black)) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:

P(correct) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black)

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is the probability of the attacker being black (P(attacker is black)) multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person:

P(incorrect) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness incorrectly identifies black)

Since the witness actually identified the attacker as black, we know that the observed event (P(observed)) is either P(correct) or P(incorrect). We can write an equation using Bayes' theorem to solve for P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is black) = P(observed) / [P(observed) + P(incorrect)]

We are given the value of P(observed) from the witness's statement and P(correct) and P(incorrect) from the information about the witness's racial identification abilities. To find P(observed), we can use the witness's statement that the attacker was identified as black. Since the attacker was identified as black, P(observed) is equal to P(correct).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is black:

{probability: 0.875, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.875 or 87.5%.
