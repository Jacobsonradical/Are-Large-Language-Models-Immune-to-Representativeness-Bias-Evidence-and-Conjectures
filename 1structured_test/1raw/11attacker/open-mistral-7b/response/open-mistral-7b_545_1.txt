Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness to the attack identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, this means they correctly identified a black person as black 80% - 20% = 60% of the time when the person was actually black.

Given that the attacker's race was not seen by the victim, we cannot assume that the attacker was white with a 85% probability. Instead, we should consider the witness's reliability. Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person as white only 20% of the time, but correctly identified a black person as black only 60% of the time, it seems that the witness is less reliable in identifying black people correctly.

Therefore, it is more likely that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error, and the attacker is actually white. The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, would be lower than the 15% population rate.

However, without more specific information about the witness's reliability in this particular situation or any other evidence, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability.

{probability: less than 15%, but a precise number cannot be determined with the given information}
