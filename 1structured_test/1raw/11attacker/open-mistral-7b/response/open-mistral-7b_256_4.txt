Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our belief about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we know from the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (from the witness's performance test: P(W|B) = 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (from the witness's performance test, since the proportion of white and black people is equal: P(W|~B) = 0.5 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.5 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (which is just the complement of P(B): P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.1765

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17.65%.
