Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the event "attacker is black" and B is the event "witness identified the attacker as black."

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15). The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black when they are black is 0.8 (from information b). This is the likelihood of B given A, L(B|A).

The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black when they are white is 0.2 (from information b). This is the likelihood of B given not A, L(B|~A).

The probability of the witness making any identification at all is the sum of the likelihood of identifying a black person and the likelihood of identifying a white person, which is 0.8 + 0.2 = 1 (from information b).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, P(A|B), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = L(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 1

P(A|B) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%. {probability: 0.12}
