Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city population is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness's statement about the attacker's race should be considered as their best guess, influenced by their error rate. We can calculate the probability of the witness being correct given the attacker's actual race by multiplying the correct identification rate by the probability of the attacker being black, and the error rate by the probability of the attacker being white.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(white) be the probability that the attacker is white.

Given the city demographics, P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is P(black) * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is P(white) * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

The witness's statement about the attacker's race being black can be considered as the sum of these two probabilities, since the witness can either be correct or incorrect. So, the total probability of the witness's statement is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

However, the witness's statement implies a higher probability of the attacker being black than if we only considered the city demographics. This suggests that the witness's statement may be biased by their error rate.

Therefore, a more conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is black could be the city demographic probability, which is P(black) = 0.15. This is a lower estimate than the witness's statement, but it is based on objective data and does not suffer from any potential bias introduced by the witness's error rate.
