Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In our case,
- H is the event that the attacker is black
- E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is black
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observation, which we can calculate as the sum of the probabilities of both events (attacker is black and witness correctly identifies, and attacker is black and witness makes an error)

Using the provided data, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there is an 85% chance the attacker is white)
4. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.2365

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's observation:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2365 â‰ˆ 0.3341

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3341 or 33.41%.
