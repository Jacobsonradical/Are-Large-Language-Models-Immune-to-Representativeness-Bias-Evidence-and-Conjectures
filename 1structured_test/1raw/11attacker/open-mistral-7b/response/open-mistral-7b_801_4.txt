To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A (the attacker being black)
- P(B) is the prior probability of the evidence B (the witness's testimony)
- P(A|B) is the probability of the event A given the evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence B given the event A

We are given the following information:
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy in identifying race)
- P(B|A) = unknown (this is what we want to estimate)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)
- P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1 - P(A)) = 0.85 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.1325 (given that 85% of the population is white)

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the known values:

P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.1325

Calculating the value:

P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.604

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.604 or 60.4%.
