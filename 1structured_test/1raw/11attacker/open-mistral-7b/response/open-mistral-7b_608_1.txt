The information provided consists of two pieces: the racial distribution of the population in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The racial distribution of the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% (correctly identifying black people) and 20% (misidentifying or failing to identify black people).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the probability is the frequency of black people in the population, which is 15%.

b) The attacker is white, and the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the probability is the frequency of white people in the population, which is 85%. However, the witness's incorrect identification rate is 20%, and since this error rate is based on a population that is half white and half black, it can be interpreted as the likelihood of misidentifying a white person as black. Therefore, this scenario's probability is 20% (the error rate) multiplied by the frequency of white people in the population, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the probability of scenario a is higher than the probability of scenario b (0.15 > 0.17), the overall probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, would be an estimate of 15%.
