Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the demographic data of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness is able to correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
2. The demographic data of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's report) = [P(Witness's report | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness's report)]

Where:
- P(Witness's report | Attacker is black) is the probability that the witness reports "black" given that the attacker is actually black. This is equal to the witness's reliability for identifying blacks, which is 0.8.
- P(Attacker is black) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the demographic data of the city, i.e., 0.15.
- P(Witness's report) is the probability of the witness reporting "black", which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness accurately reporting "black" (when the attacker is black) and the probabilities of the witness making an error (when the attacker is white).

Using the given witness's reliability and prior probability, we can calculate P(Witness's report):

P(Witness's report) = P(Witness's report | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness's report | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)

Since the witness's reliability for identifying whites is given as 0.8, the error rate for identifying whites is 0.2. Therefore, P(Witness's report | Attacker is white) = 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is white, P(Attacker is white) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(Witness's report):

P(Witness's report) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's report:

P(Attacker is black | Witness's report) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.48 or 48%

So, based on the witness's report and the demographic data of the city, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
