Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observation E.

We know the values of P(E|H) (0.8) and P(H) (0.15) from the information given. To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is not black, P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black, and P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black. Since the witness identifies races incorrectly 20% of the time, we can assume that P(E|~H) = 0.2.

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(~H), but we do know that P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities: the attacker is black or not black). So, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.483

So, based on the given information, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.483 or 48.3%.
