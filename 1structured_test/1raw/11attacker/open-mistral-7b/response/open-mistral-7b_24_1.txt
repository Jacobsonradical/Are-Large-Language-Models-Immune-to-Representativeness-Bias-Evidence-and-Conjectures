Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, with 85% white and 15% black population.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so we cannot directly use this information to determine the attacker's race. Instead, we will use the witness's error rate to account for the possibility that the witness might have made a mistake in identifying the attacker's race.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (80%). Since the witness also has a 20% chance of making a mistake, the probability that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race is 0.2 (20%).

Given the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%). Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness made an error or not, we cannot directly use the witness's identification to update the probability that the attacker is black.

However, we can use the witness's error rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification. If we assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race, then the probability that the attacker is white would be equal to the probability that the witness made a mistake, meaning the probability that the attacker is white is 0.2 (20%).

On the other hand, if we assume that the witness did not make an error in identifying the attacker's race, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%).

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness made an error or not, we must consider both scenarios. The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the weighted average of the probabilities in both scenarios, where the weights are determined by the probabilities of the scenarios:

probability = (probability that the witness made an error) * (probability that the attacker is white given the witness made an error) + (probability that the witness did not make an error) * (probability that the attacker is black given the witness did not make an error)

probability = (0.2) * (0.2) + (1 - 0.2) * (0.15)
probability = 0.04 + 0.12
probability = 0.16

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.16 (16%). This estimate takes into account the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city. However, it is important to note that this estimate is uncertain due to the lack of information about whether the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race.
