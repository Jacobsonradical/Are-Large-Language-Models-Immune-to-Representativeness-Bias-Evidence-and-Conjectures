Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly by the victim, we can consider this as an error for the witness. Therefore, the probability that the witness's error was in identifying the attacker as black is 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of an attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that the error occurred in identifying the attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 or 97%.
