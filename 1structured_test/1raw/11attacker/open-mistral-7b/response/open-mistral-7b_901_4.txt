Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, which we want to estimate.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is given as 0.2.
- P(B) is the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony.
- P(~B) is the probability of the attacker being non-black before considering the witness's testimony.

We are given that 85% of the population is white, so P(~B) = 0.85. To find P(B), we can use the fact that P(B) + P(~B) = 1, so P(B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us a probability of 0.27, or 27%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.27 or 27%.
