Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given to be 0.8 (80%)
- P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is given to be 0.2 (20%)
- P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or not black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

This calculation gives us an estimate of 0.17, or 17%.

However, the witness's error rate seems to contradict the city's demographic data. Given that 85% of the population is white, it would be highly unlikely for the witness to incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. This might indicate that there is an error or inconsistency in the information provided. Therefore, this calculation might not accurately reflect the true probability. It would be advisable to investigate further and obtain more reliable information.

{probability: 0.17, please note that this is an estimate based on the provided information, but given the inconsistency, it may not be reliable}
