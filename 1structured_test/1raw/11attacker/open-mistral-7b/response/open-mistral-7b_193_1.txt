To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We also know that the error rate of the witness in identifying race is 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:
1) The witness was correct (P(black))
2) The witness made an error (1 - P(black))

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness was correct given that they identified the attacker as black is:
P(black | identified as black) = P(black) / (P(black) + (1 - P(black)) * 0.2)

We have another piece of information that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. This means that P(black) = 0.15 and P(white) = 0.85.

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability P(black | identified as black):
P(black | identified as black) = P(identified as black | black) * P(black) / P(identified as black)

First, we need to find P(identified as black | black):
P(identified as black | black) = 1 (since the attacker is definitely black if the witness is correct)

Now, we can find P(identified as black):
P(identified as black) = P(identified as black | black) * P(black) + P(identified as black | not black) * P(not black)

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(identified as black | not black) = 0.2

Now, we can plug in the values:
P(identified as black) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

So, P(black | identified as black) = 1 / (1 + 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.15) = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:
{probability: 0.8}
