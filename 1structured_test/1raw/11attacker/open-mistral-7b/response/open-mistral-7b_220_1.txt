Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We have two conditional probabilities:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black, which is given as 0.2 (20%).
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is the complement of P(H), or 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability, we find:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.249

So, given the witness's evidence and the racial composition of the city, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24.9%.
