Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's mistake rate (20%) is not accounted for in the first piece of information. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are evenly distributed between the two races, then we can adjust the 80% success rate accordingly.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as p. We know that the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, and white people 80% of the time as well (since the mistake rate is evenly distributed).

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85 and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

So, if p is the true probability of the attacker being black, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we have:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p) = 0.8

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.5

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.5} or 50%.
