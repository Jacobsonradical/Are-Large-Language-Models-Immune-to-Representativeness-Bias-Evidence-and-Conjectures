Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily correct, as they only correctly identified race 80% of the time.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that when they see a white person, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time. Since the city is 85% white, this means that out of the times the witness sees a white person (which is 85% of the time), they will mistakenly identify them as black 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

So, when the witness sees a black person (which is 15% of the time), they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time. But when they see a white person (which is 85% of the time), they mistakenly identify them as black 17% of the time.

Therefore, the total probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (either correctly or mistakenly) is 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.21 + 0.14 = 0.35 or 35%.

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black, not the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we know that the actual attacker is either correctly identified as black (with probability 0.80) or mistakenly identified as black (with probability 0.17). The total probability of this happening is 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97 or 97%.

So, the actual probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, which is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black divided by the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 / 0.97 = 0.82 or 82%.
