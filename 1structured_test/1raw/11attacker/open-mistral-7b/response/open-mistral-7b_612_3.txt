Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about the attacker's race being correct or incorrect. But we do know the racial composition of the city, with 85% white and 15% black.

Since the witness is mistake-prone, we can consider two scenarios:
1) The attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness's bias might lead to incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which would lower the observed percentage of black attackers.
2) The attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness's bias might lead to incorrectly identifying a black person as white, which would increase the observed percentage of black attackers.

Without knowing the exact distribution of errors in scenario 1 or 2, it's not possible to provide a precise probability. However, we can make an educated guess based on the racial composition of the city.

If we assume that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two races, then the observed percentage of black attackers (80%) would be an overestimate of the true percentage. In this case, the true percentage would be lower than 15%, but we don't have enough information to provide a specific number.

So, strictly speaking, without more information, it's not possible to provide a numerical probability estimate. However, the racial composition of the city suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white than black, given the witness's error rate.
