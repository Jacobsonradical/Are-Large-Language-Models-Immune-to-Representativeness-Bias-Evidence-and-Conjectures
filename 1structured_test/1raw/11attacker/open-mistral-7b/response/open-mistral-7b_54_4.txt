To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race judgment and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 0.8 (80%), and they make errors 0.2 (20%) of the time. Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of encountering a white person is 0.85, and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, we can assume that their errors are distributed equally between misidentifying whites as blacks and misidentifying blacks as whites. This means that when the witness identifies a person as black, there is a 0.2 chance that they are mistaken and the person is actually white.

Since the city is 85% white, the probability that a person identified as black by the witness is actually white is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. This means that the probability that a person identified as black by the witness is actually black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.83.
