Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's identification

The prior probability of H (P(H)) is given in the first piece of information, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is black).

The likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)) is given in the second piece of information, which is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 0.8 (80%).

The likelihood of E given not H (P(E|not H)) is the complement of P(E|H), which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).

The prior probability of not H (P(not H)) is 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

So, the probability of H given E (P(H|E)) can be estimated using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.31

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.31, or 31%.
