Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The city's racial demographics: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify races: 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies the race, and 20% of the time, the witness makes an error.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability of the attacker being black, as we do not know the reliability of the witness's identification in this specific case.

Instead, let's calculate the expected probability of a random person being identified as black based on the witness's tracking record. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, a random person has a 15% chance of being black. If the witness is correct 80% of the time, they would correctly identify a black person 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12% of the time. If they are incorrect, they would incorrectly identify a white person as black 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they were correct is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 (correct identification of a black person) + 0.17 (incorrect identification of a white person as black).

Using these calculations, we estimate the probability that the attacker is black to be 0.29 or 29%.
