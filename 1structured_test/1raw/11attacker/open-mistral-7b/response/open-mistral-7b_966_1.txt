Given the information provided, the probability estimate of the attacker being black would be:

{
  "probability": 0.8
}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as black.
3. Since the witness's accuracy rate is higher than the actual population ratio of blacks in the city, it implies that the witness might have mistakenly identified a white person as black or correctly identified a black person.
4. Without additional information, it's impossible to definitively say whether the attacker was misidentified or not. Therefore, the best estimate would be to use the witness's identification as a data point and consider it as evidence.
5. The witness's identification of the attacker as black has a probability of 0.8 (80%) based on their past performance, assuming that their ability to judge race is consistent.
