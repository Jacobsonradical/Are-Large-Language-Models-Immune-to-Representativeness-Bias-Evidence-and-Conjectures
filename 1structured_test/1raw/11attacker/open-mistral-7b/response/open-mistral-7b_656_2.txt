To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probabilistic concept that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population in the city is 15% black)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2 (due to the witness's error rate, the probability of being identified as black is lower than the actual proportion of black people in the population)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2
                 = 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.6, or 60%.
