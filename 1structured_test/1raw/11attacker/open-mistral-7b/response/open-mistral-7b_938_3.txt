To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a black person, and a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a black person as white. Given the racial composition of the city, 15% of the population is black.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%) times the probability that the attacker is black. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black (assuming the attacker is actually white) is 0.2 (20%) times the probability that the attacker is white.

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black can be calculated by adding these two probabilities:

0.8 * Probability(Attacker is Black) + 0.2 * Probability(Attacker is White)

We are given that 85% of the population is white. So, the probability that the attacker is white is 1 - 15% = 0.85.

Now, we can solve for Probability(Attacker is Black):

0.8 * Probability(Attacker is Black) + 0.2 * 0.85 = Witness's Statement (Attacker identified as black)

0.8 * Probability(Attacker is Black) = Witness's Statement - 0.2 * 0.85

Probability(Attacker is Black) = (Witness's Statement - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

Given the witness's statement that the attacker was identified as black, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.91 or 91%.
