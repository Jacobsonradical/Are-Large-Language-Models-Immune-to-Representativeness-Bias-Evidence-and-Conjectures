To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the racial distribution in the sample used to assess the witness's ability is similar to the city's population, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case,
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We have:
- P(B|A) = the witness's probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8
- P(A) = the probability that the attacker is black, which is the probability we want to estimate
- P(B) = the probability that the witness identifies someone as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of a black and white person being identified as black by the witness
- P(B|A) * P(A) = the probability of both events A and B happening, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person and the attacker is indeed black
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
- P(B|not A) = the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2
- P(not A) = the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - P(A)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|not A) = 0.2. We also know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. So P(not A) = 0.15 and P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.39.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.33 = 0.3636

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
