Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A represents the attacker being black, and B represents the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

The probability of the witness's statement being true if the attacker is black is P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify race).

The probability of the witness's statement being true if the attacker is white is P(B|not A) = 0.2 (because the error rate is 20%).

The prior probability of the attacker being black is P(A) = 0.15 (from the population composition in the city).

The probability of the witness's statement being true, regardless of the attacker's race, is P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
          = 0.12 / 0.144
          = 0.828571428571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83, or 83%.
