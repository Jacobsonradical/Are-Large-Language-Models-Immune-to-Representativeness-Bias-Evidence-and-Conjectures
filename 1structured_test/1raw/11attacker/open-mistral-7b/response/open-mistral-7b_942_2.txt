Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if this identification was correct or an error. Since we don't have enough information to determine whether this specific identification was correct or not, we cannot provide a definitive probability.

However, if we were to make an assumption, we could calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given the population distribution. Since the population is 85% white, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we would expect the witness to incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black would be 1 - 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.54, or 54%.

This calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the race of the person they are identifying, which may not be the case. Therefore, this is just an approximation and the actual probability could be different.

{probability: 0.54, note: This is an approximation and the actual probability could be different.}
