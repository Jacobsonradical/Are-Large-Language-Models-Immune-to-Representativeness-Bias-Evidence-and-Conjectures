Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black.

Since we don't have enough information about the actual racial distribution of attackers in the city, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker is black based on the racial composition alone.

However, we can use the witness's reliability to make an estimate. Since the witness incorrectly identified a race 20% of the time, the remaining 80% of the time, they are likely to be correct. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black, which means there is a 80% chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed black.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness made an error. If the witness is wrong 20% of the time, then the attacker could potentially be white 20% of the time.

But since we don't have any direct evidence of the attacker's race, we can only consider the most likely scenario given the information we have. Therefore, our estimate based on the witness's reliability is:

{probability: 0.8}
