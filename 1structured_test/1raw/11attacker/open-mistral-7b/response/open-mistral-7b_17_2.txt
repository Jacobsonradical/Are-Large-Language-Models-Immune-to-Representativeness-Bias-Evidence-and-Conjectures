Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let:
- P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black (given in the second piece of information: 80%)
- P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (given in the second piece of information: 20%)
- P(~A) be the prior probability of the attacker not being black (given in the first piece of information: 1 - P(A) = 0.85)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.52 or 52%. Therefore, based on the given information, we estimate that there is a 52% probability that the attacker is black.
