Given the information provided, we cannot estimate the attacker's race with certainty because the victim could not see the attacker's race. However, we do have some statistical information about the population and the witness's accuracy.

The population statistics tell us that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. The witness's ability to identify race is 80% accurate, meaning they incorrectly identify race 20% of the time.

If we assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the actual race of the person, and that they made an error in identifying the attacker as black, then the probability that the attacker is actually white is 80% (the witness's error rate).

However, since we cannot rule out the possibility that the witness's identification was correct, the overall probability that the attacker is black must be lower than 15%, the population proportion.

Given these considerations, a conservative estimate for the probability that the attacker is black could be the population proportion minus the witness's error rate, which is 0.15 - 0.2 = 0.15.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error is always in favor of the minority group (black in this case). If the error rate is not biased, the estimate would be closer to the population proportion divided by (1 - error rate), which is 0.15 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.230769.

Therefore, the best estimate based on this information is between 0.15 and 0.23, with a conservative estimate of 0.15.
