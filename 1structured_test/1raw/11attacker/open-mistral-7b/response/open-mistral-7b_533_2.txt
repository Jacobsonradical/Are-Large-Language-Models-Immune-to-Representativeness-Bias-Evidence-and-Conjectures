Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between mistakenly identifying a white person as black and a black person as white, then in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

However, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If the witness's error rate is evenly distributed, then we would expect the witness to mistakenly identify a white person as black about 20% of the time (since 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies race).

But in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than the 20% error rate.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is more than 20%, but less than 100% (since the witness's identification is not perfect).

However, we don't have enough information to calculate an exact probability. We would need more information about the error distribution or about the specific circumstances of the witness's identification.

Therefore, I must reserve judgment and provide an answer in the following format: {probability: "greater than 0.2, less than 1.0", please provide a range}
