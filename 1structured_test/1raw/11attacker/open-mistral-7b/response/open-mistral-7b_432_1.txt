Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that the hypothesis H is true
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of observing the evidence E (regardless of whether the hypothesis is true or false)

Let's break it down:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)): 15% (from information "a")
2. Probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (P(E|H)): 0.8 (from information "b")
3. Probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white (P(E|~H)): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (Assuming that the witness is equally likely to err in identifying a white person as a black person. The 0.8 is the prior probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white, and the 0.2 is the prior probability of the attacker being white.)
4. Probability of observing the evidence E (regardless of whether the hypothesis is true or false): P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66.7%.
