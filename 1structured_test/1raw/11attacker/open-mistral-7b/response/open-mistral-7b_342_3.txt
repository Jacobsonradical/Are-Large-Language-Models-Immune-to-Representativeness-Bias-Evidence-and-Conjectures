Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being black, given by the city's demographics: P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) is the prior probability of an attacker being white: P(not A) = 0.85
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker: P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black: P(B|not A) = 0.2

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.35 (or 35%). So, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, we estimate that there is a 35% chance that the attacker is black.
