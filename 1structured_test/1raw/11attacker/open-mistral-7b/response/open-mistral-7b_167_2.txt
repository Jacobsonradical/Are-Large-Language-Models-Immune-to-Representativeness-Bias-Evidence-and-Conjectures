Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is as follows:

1. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
3. We don't have any information about the attacker's actual race, so the witness's identification is our only source of information.
4. To estimate the probability, we can multiply the witness's success rate (80%) by the proportion of black people in the city (15%):

{probability: 0.12, this is 12%}

So, given the information, our estimate is that the attacker has a 12% chance of being black.
