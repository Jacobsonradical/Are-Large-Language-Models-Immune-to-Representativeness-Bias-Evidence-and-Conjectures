Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' Theorem is a probability rule that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (which we can calculate based on the witness's error rate)

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (The proportion of black people in the population is 15%)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
