Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given to be 15% or 0.15
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, given that the person is black. This is given to be 0.8 (80%), so P(B|W) = 0.8
- P(W|B) as the likelihood of the witness making the identification, given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's success rate in identifying black people, which is given to be 0.8, so P(W|B) = 0.8
- P(B|~W) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person, given that the attacker is not black. Since the probability of the attacker not being black is 1 - P(B) = 0.85, and the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B|~W) = 0.2 / 0.85 = 0.235.
- P(W|~B) as the likelihood of the witness making the identification, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness correctly identifies white people 100% of the time, P(W|~B) = 1.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.85))

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.396

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 39.6%.
