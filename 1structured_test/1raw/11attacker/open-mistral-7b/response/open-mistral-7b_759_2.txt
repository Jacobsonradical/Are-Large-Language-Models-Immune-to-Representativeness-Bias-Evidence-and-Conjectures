To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, meaning they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness would correctly identify a black person in a random encounter:

Expected correct identifications of black people = Probability of encountering a black person * Witness's accuracy rate
                                                                  = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                  = 0.12

Now, the witness identified the attacker as black. Since they are wrong 20% of the time, the probability that their identification is incorrect is 0.2. So, the probability that their identification is correct is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the ratio of expected correct identifications of black people to the total number of times the witness could have mistakenly identified a white person as black:

Probability of attacker being black = Expected correct identifications of black people / (Probability of witness's mistake + Expected correct identifications of black people)
                                                    = 0.12 / (0.2 + 0.12)
                                                    â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
