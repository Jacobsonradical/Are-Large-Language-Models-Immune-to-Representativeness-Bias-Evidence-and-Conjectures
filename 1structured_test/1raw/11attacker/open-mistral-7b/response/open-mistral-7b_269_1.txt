Given the information provided, we have two probabilities to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race: 80% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness could have made an error.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of correct identification is 0.8. Given that 15% of the city's population is black, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness made a correct identification and the attacker is indeed black. This probability is the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being black.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.29} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
