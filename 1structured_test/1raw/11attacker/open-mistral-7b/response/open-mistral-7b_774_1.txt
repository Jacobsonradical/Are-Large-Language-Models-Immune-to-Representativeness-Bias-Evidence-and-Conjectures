Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is calculated as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" (A) and event B is "witness identified attacker as black" (B).

We are given the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases where the attacker was not black)

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 1 * 0.15 / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given P(B|A) and P(B|not A), but we don't have explicit values for P(B), P(A), and P(not A). However, we can rewrite the denominator in terms of known values:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
     = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.3425

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.3425
      â‰ˆ 0.438

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.438 or 43.8%.
