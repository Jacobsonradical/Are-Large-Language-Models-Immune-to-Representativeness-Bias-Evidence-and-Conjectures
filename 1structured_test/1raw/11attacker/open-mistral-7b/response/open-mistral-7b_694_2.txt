To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the times. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, there are two possibilities:

1. The attacker is actually black (true positive).
2. The witness errs and mistakenly identifies a white person as black (false positive).

The probability of a false positive is given by the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

On the other hand, if the witness identifies the attacker as white, there are also two possibilities:

1. The attacker is actually white (true negative).
2. The witness errs and mistakenly identifies a black person as white (false negative).

The probability of a false negative is 1 - the witness's success rate, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white (P(white)) is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black (P(black)) is 0.15.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we're interested in the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives:

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = P(true positive) / (P(true positive) + P(false positive))

= 0.15 * P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black | attacker is black)
  / (0.15 * P(witness correctly identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) + 0.2 * P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker as black | attacker is white))

= 0.15 * (0.8)
  / (0.15 * (0.8) + 0.2 * (0.2))

= 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the actual racial composition of the city's population. This discrepancy highlights the potential unreliability of eyewitness testimony and the importance of considering all available evidence in a criminal investigation.
