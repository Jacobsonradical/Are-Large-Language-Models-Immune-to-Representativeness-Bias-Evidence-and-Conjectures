To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial distribution in the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not in this specific case, we'll consider both possibilities:

a) If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed black. In this case, the probability is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).

b) If the witness made an error, then the attacker is actually white. However, given that the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 20%.

So, the total probability of the attacker being black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.28}

The estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.28 or 28%.
