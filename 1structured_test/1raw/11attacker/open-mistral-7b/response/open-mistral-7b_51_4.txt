To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, they misidentified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white, and the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 15% chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's racial distribution, is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
