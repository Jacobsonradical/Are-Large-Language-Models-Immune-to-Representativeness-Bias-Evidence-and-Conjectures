Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate this probability:

P(black) = [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

We have P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race), P(attacker is black) = 0.15 (from population data), and P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (assuming the witness's error rate is the same for both races, which is a reasonable assumption given the lack of specific information).

Using these values, we can calculate P(black):

P(black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.21

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 21%.
