To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the population (which is approximately the case given the 85% white and 15% black population), then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is equal to the probability of mistakenly identifying a black person as white.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of being correct is 0.8. Since there are two types of errors (mistaking a white person for black and vice versa), the probability of making an error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

There are two possible scenarios for the attacker's race: the attacker is black, or the attacker is white. In the first scenario, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8. In the second scenario, the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2.

The probability of the first scenario is 0.8 (probability of correct identification), and the probability of the second scenario is 0.2 (probability of error). Since these are the only two scenarios, we can find the probability of the attacker being black by adding the probabilities of the two scenarios:

probability of attacker being black = probability of correct identification + probability of error in identifying a white person as black
                                                 = 0.8 + 0.2 * (probability of attacker being white)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the probability of the attacker being white:

probability of attacker being white = (1 - 0.8) / 0.2 = 0.25

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being black:

probability of attacker being black = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.8 + 0.05 = 0.85

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.85, or 85%.
