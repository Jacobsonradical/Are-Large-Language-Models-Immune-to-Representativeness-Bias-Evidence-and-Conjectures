To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. This means the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2 (20%).

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%). However, if we consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race, the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, if the attacker is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black.

Thus, {probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)} is an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's reliability and the city's racial demographics.
