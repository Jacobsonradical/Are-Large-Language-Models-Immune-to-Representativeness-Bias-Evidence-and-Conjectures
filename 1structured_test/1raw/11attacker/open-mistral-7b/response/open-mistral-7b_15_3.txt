Given the information provided, the population breakdown of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80% correct, with an error rate of 20%. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can consider both the population breakdown and the witness's error rate. If the attacker was white, there is a 85% chance the witness would misidentify him as black due to the witness's error rate. Since the witness did identify the attacker as black, this means that the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's identification, is less than 85%.

We can calculate this probability mathematically using Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is white, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the probability of A occurring, P(B) is the probability of B occurring, and P(B|A) is the probability of B given A.

Given that P(B|A) = 0.2 (the error rate of the witness), we can calculate P(A) by rearranging Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 * P(A) / 0.8

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.2 * P(B) / 0.8 = 0.125 * 0.8 = 0.1

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, is 10%. Since the probability of the attacker being black is 1 minus the probability of the attacker being white, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.9}
