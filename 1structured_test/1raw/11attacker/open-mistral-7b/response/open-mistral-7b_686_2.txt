Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race is 20% (0.2).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is therefore 1 - the probability of error, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as black given that the attacker is white is the probability of error, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
        â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
