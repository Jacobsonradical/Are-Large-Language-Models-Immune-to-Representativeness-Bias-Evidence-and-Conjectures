To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness identifies race correctly 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time. However, we cannot directly apply this proportion to the city's racial demographics since the witness made an error in this specific case.

In the city, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If we assume that the witness's mistake was a false identification of a white person as black (given the higher proportion of white people in the city), then the probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person.

So, the probability that the attacker is black = 0.15 (proportion of black people) * 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person) = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.12} or 12%.
