To provide an estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person,
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black,
- ~B represents the attacker is not black.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We're given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying non-black people as black)

Now, let's compute:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(B|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.3 * 0.85]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.12 / 0.53
P(B|W) ≈ 0.226

So, given the witness's identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.226 or 22.6%.
