To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, P(H|E) is the probability we are interested in, which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the probability that a black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that they correctly identify a black person as black 80% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence. Since we have no information about the attacker's race, we should assume that they are equally likely to be black or white, so P(H) = 0.5.

P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the probability that the witness would identify any person as black, given their ability to judge race. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of picking a black person at random is 0.15. However, the witness identifies black people as black 80% of the time and white people as black 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness identifying any person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.20.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.20 = 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4 or 40%.
