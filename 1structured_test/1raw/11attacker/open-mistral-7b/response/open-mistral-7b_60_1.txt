The given information suggests that the overall population is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfectly accurate, as they are incorrect 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy is not 100%. Therefore, we can't simply take the witness's statement at face value and assume that the attacker is definitely black.

Let's calculate the probability based on the witness's accuracy and the overall population statistics:

1. If the attacker is actually white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will mistake them for black (given the witness's 80% accuracy).
2. If the attacker is actually black, then the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8) plus the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black (0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83 or 83%.
