To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the following factors:

1. The racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black).
2. The accuracy of the witness in identifying race (80% correct, 20% error).

The witness's identification of the attacker as black could be correct or an error. Given the racial composition of the city, we can calculate the probability of this event being an error.

The probability of the witness making an error when identifying a white person is 20%, and the probability of making an error when identifying a black person is also 20%, due to the witness's equal accuracy rate.

Since the attacker's race is unknown, the probability of the witness making an error in this case is the weighted average of these two probabilities, depending on the racial composition of the city.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black.
Then, P(W) = 1 - P(B) is the probability that the attacker is white.

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, we have:

P(W) = 0.85
P(B) = 0.15

We can now calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is black:

P(error|B) = 0.2

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white:

P(error|W) = 0.2

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event given that the attacker is black is 0, and given that the attacker is white is 0.

However, we can calculate the probability of the event occurring given the witness's identification, which is the sum of these probabilities weighted by their respective probabilities:

P(attacker is black|witness's identification) = P(witness's identification|attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)
                                                            = 0 * P(B) + P(error|B) * P(W)
                                                            = 0 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                                                            = 0.17

This means that, given the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 17%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's race. If the witness's accuracy depends on the attacker's race, then the calculation would be more complex and would require additional information.

So, strictly in the dictionary format:
{probability: 0.17}
