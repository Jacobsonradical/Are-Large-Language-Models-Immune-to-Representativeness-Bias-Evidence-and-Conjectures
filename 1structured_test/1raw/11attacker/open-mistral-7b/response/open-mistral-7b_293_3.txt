Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as we do not know if the witness made an accurate identification or an error.

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (the population is 15% black)
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

So, P(E) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.3764

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 37.64%.
