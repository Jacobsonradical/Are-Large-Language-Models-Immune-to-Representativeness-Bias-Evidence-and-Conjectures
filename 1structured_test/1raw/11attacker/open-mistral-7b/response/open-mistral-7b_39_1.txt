To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification under similar conditions.

The racial composition of the city is given as 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% in similar conditions, with an error rate of 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a possibility that this identification was incorrect.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (being black) and the probability of the witness making an error (being white).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (being black) is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:

P(Witness correctly identified black) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness correctly identifies black | Attacker is black)
                                                          = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                          = 0.12

The probability of the witness making an error (being white) is the probability of the attacker being white multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

P(Witness incorrectly identified black) = P(Attacker is white) * P(Witness incorrectly identifies black | Attacker is white)
                                                             = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                             = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification:

{probability: 0.12}

In other words, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate relies on several assumptions and may not be accurate in real-world scenarios, especially considering potential biases and limitations in witness testimonies.
