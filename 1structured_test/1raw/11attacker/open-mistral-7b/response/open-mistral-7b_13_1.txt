Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have specific information about the witness identifying the attacker, only that they identified the attacker as black. Since we don't know if this identification was correct or not, we cannot directly use the witness's error rate in this case.

However, we do have information about the racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This demographic information can be used to make an estimate.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, without knowing if this identification was correct or not, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that another event B has occurred is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is that the attacker is black and event B is that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 80% according to the information given.
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% according to the demographic information.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15 = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%. However, this estimate is sensitive to the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is the same in the dark as in daylight, and that they made the identification based solely on race. If these assumptions are not valid, the estimate could be significantly different.
