To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The attacker being black according to the witness (correct identification): 0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) = 0.12

The attacker being black despite the witness saying white (error in identification): 0.2 (probability of error) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being white) = 0.17

The witness's statement that the attacker is black consists of both the correct identification and the error. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of these two probabilities:

Overall probability of attacker being black: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
