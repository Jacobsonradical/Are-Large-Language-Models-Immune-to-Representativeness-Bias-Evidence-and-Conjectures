To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

1. The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (given in information b).
2. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 (given in information a).
3. Therefore, the probability of both events happening (witness error and attacker being white) is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. This is given as 0.80 (given in information a). Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of the attacker being black is the product of the witness's accuracy and the population proportion of blacks:

1. The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Since we are looking for the probability that the attacker is black, the sum of this probability and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black should equal 1. However, our calculated probabilities do not sum up to 1. This is because our initial assumption that the witness's error rate and the attacker's race are independent may not hold true in this context.

Given the limited information, it is challenging to provide a precise probability estimate that strictly adheres to the given information. Therefore, I would recommend seeking additional information or consulting a statistician for a more accurate estimate.

{probability: Approximately 12% (with reservations due to the independence assumption), please note that this might not be a reliable estimate given the limited information}
