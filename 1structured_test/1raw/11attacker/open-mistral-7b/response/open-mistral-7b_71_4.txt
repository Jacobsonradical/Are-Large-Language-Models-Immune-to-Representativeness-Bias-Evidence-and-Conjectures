The given information suggests that in the general population, 85% of the people are white and 15% are black. However, a witness, who is not perfectly reliable in identifying race, has identified the attacker as black.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race. Probability of this scenario: 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate)
2. The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the race. Probability of this scenario: 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the population) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

The total probability of these two scenarios is the sum of their individual probabilities:

Total probability = Probability of scenario 1 + Probability of scenario 2
                            = 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2
                            = 0.8 + 0.03
                            = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the information and witness's statement, is 0.83.
