To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as non-black
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being non-black

We are given the following information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's performance)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from the witness's performance)

We are also given the total population, which is made up of 85% white people and 15% black people. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly use this information to calculate the likelihood of the witness being correct or incorrect.

To overcome this, we can use the fact that the witness's performance is independent of the attacker's race, meaning that the likelihood of the witness being correct or incorrect does not depend on whether the attacker is black or not. This means that P(E|H) and P(E|~H) are constant numbers that do not change based on the attacker's race.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this, we find that P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.61 (61%) is the estimated probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the given information, we estimate that there is a 61% chance that the attacker is black.
