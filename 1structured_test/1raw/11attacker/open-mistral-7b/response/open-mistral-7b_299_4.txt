The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black, but their identification was not perfectly accurate.
4. So, even if the attacker was actually white (which is more likely given the city's demographics), there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.
5. Conversely, if the attacker was actually black, there is a 80% chance that the witness would correctly identify them as such.
6. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by considering both the city's demographics and the witness's reliability:

   Probability of attacker being black = Probability of attacker being black given witness's identification * Probability of witness's identification being correct

   Probability of attacker being black given witness's identification = 1 (since the attacker was identified as black)

   Probability of witness's identification being correct = 0.8 (given in the information)

   Therefore, Probability of attacker being black = 1 * 0.8 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8, or 80%.
