Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the population statistics in the city, which is 15% (0.15). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we're interested in the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness made this identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / P(Witness Identification)

P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) = 0.8
P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Not Black) = 0.2 (assuming the witness errs equally often for black and white people)
P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15
P(Attacker is Not Black) = 0.85

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Not Black) * P(Attacker is Not Black)

P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48 or 48%

Therefore, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
