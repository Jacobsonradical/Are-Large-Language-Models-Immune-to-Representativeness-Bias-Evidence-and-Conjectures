Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's reliability and the population distribution. Since we don't know if the witness saw the attacker correctly or incorrectly, we'll need to consider both possibilities.

Let's denote:
- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white

From the information given, we know that P(black) + P(white) = 1 (total probability).

Now, we have two scenarios to consider:

Scenario 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is actually black (P(black)), and the witness correctly identified it (0.8 probability). So the probability of this scenario is 0.8 * P(black).

Scenario 2: The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race. In this case, the attacker is white (P(white)), but the witness incorrectly identified it as black with a probability of 0.2. So the probability of this scenario is 0.2 * P(white).

The total probability of the attacker being identified as black is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

P(attacker identified as black) = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * P(white)

Since we know that P(black) + P(white) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(attacker identified as black) = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black))

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. P(black) + P(white) = 1
2. 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.8 (the probability the witness gave)

We can solve this system of equations to find P(black). However, since we don't have enough information to find exact values, we can only give an estimate based on the given population distribution.

Given that 85% of the population is white, we can assume that P(white) is close to 0.85 and P(black) is close to 0.15. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) ≈ 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.12 + 0.2 = 0.32

So, given the information provided, it's estimated that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.32 or 32%. Keep in mind that this is only an estimate based on the data given and may not reflect the true probability in reality.
