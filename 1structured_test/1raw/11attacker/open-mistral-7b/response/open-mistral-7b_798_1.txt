Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a rule that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's statement and the city's demographics).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we want to find P(H|E), where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the race 20% of the time, so the probability of erring when the attacker is not black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the city's population is 85% white)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
    = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
    = 0.12 + 0.17
    = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
       ≈ (0.12 * 0.15) / 0.29
       ≈ 0.10

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.10 or 10%. This means that given the evidence and the witness's ability to judge race, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the given information and assumptions, and other factors could potentially change this probability.
