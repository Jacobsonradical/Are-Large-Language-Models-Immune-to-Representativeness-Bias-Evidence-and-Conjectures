To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error by incorrectly identifying a black person as white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black) and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white). We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1.

If the attacker is black, the probability of the witness misidentifying them as white is the error rate, which is 0.2. So, we can write an equation for this scenario as:

P(black) * 0.2 = P(witness misidentifies black as white | attacker is black)

Similarly, if the attacker is white, the probability of the witness misidentifying them as black is also the error rate, which is 0.2. So, we can write an equation for this scenario as:

P(white) * 0.2 = P(witness misidentifies white as black | attacker is white)

Since the total probability of misidentifications is equal to the error rate, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

P(black) * 0.2 = P(white) * 0.2

Now, we can solve for P(black) using the racial composition of the population. We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1, and we can write an equation for P(white) using the information that 85% of the population is white:

P(white) = 0.85

Now we can substitute P(white) into the equation we derived earlier:

P(black) * 0.2 = 0.85 * 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.17

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.17 or 17%.
