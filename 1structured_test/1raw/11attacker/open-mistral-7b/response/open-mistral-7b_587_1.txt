To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time. Since we don't have information about whether the witness's error in this case was identifying a black person as white or vice versa, we'll assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two types of errors (this is called the Bayesian assumption of independence).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a randomly selected person being white is 0.85. The probability of a randomly selected person being black is therefore 0.15.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, the witness's statement that the attacker was black suggests that the witness did make a correct identification in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification divided by the total probability of the witness making a correct or incorrect identification:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(witness correctly identified | attacker is black) / P(witness correctly identified or erroneously identified)

P(witness correctly identified | attacker is black) = 0.12

P(witness correctly identified or erroneously identified) = P(witness correctly identified | attacker is black) + P(witness incorrectly identified | attacker is black)

P(witness incorrectly identified | attacker is black) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

P(witness correctly identified or erroneously identified) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.8, or 80%.

In summary, based on the witness's statement and the racial composition of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8. This estimate takes into account the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, but it assumes that the error rate is evenly distributed between identifying a black person as white and identifying a white person as black. If the error rate was not evenly distributed, the estimate could be different.
