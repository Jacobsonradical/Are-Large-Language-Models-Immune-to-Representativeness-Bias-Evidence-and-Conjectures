Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability of A (the attacker is black) is what we want to estimate. The probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifies a black attacker) is 0.8 (from the first piece of information). The probability of B (the witness identifies anyone as black) is 0.5 (since half of the population is black). The probability of A given B (given that the witness identified someone as black, what is the probability that they were right and the attacker is black) is equal to the witness's accuracy rate when identifying race, which is 0.8.

The probability of B (the witness identifies anyone as black) is given to us as 0.5.

So, Bayes' theorem gives us:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.5

We can rearrange this to find P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(B) / P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.8 = 0.5

However, given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black (from the second piece of information), it seems there might be a mistake in the numbers provided. If the true ratio is 85% white and 15% black, then the probability of A (the attacker is black) would be 0.15, and the probability of B (the witness identifies anyone as black) would be 0.15 * 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time) = 0.12.

So, if the numbers provided are accurate, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.5. However, if the true ratio of white and black people in the city is 85% to 15%, then the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15.
