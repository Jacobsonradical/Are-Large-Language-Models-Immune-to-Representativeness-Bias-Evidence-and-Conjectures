Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker, we can assume that the witness's observations are independent events when they identified the attacker as black.

Given this, the probability that the attacker is black, according to the witness's account, is 0.8 (or 80%). However, this is not the actual probability, as the witness's observations may not accurately reflect the true racial composition of the attacker.

To estimate the actual probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the racial distribution in the city (85% white and 15% black).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)], where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the attacker is black given the witness's account)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being black in the city)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the witness correctly identifying a black person)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.85 (given 85% of the population is white), and P(A) = 0.15 (given 15% of the population is black).

To calculate P(A|B), we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.85
       = 0.12

Therefore, given the witness's account and the racial distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%). This is significantly lower than the witness's estimate, indicating that the witness's racial identification may not be reliable in this situation.
