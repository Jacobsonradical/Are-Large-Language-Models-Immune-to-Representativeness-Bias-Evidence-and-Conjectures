To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of updating our beliefs in the light of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 in the information.
- P(B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is given by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification (when the attacker is black) and a mistaken identification (when the attacker is white).

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = x (which we want to find), and P(B) = 0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x).

We also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, x = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this, we find that P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.58.

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.58. This means there is a slightly higher than 50% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.
