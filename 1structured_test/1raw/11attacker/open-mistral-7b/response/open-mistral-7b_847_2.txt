Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the probability before new evidence) with the likelihood of the evidence given the prior.

In this case, the prior probability is the racial distribution of the city, which is 85% white and 15% black. The likelihood of the evidence is the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so the likelihood of a black attacker being identified as black is 0.8. The likelihood of a white attacker being identified as black is 0.2 (since the witness mistakes white for black 20% of the time).

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = [P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

This simplifies to:

P(attacker is black | witness identification) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(attacker is black | witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
