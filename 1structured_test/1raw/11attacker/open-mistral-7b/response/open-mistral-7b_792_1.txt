The probability estimate is not straightforward due to the conflicting pieces of information provided. On one hand, we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. On the other hand, a witness who is generally accurate in identifying race (80% correct) has identified the attacker as black.

However, the witness's error rate (20%) is significant, and they made an error in this case. Without more information about the specific circumstances of this incident or the witness's performance in this specific situation, it's impossible to accurately weigh the conflicting evidence.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive probability estimate based on the information provided. The problem seems to require additional context or assumptions to make a reasonable probability calculation.
