Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being black.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the person was white)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (15% of the population is not black)

We are asked to find P(A|B), so we can substitute the values into the formula:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.374

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 37.4%.
