To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break it down:

1. P(H) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 15% in the first piece of information.
2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker is black, the probability of being correctly identified is 0.8, and the probability of being misidentified is 0.2.
3. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is white, the probability of being misidentified as black is 0.5 (since the witness incorrectly identifies half of the white people as black).
4. P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is not black, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
5. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H).

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.5) * (0.85)]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.425]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
