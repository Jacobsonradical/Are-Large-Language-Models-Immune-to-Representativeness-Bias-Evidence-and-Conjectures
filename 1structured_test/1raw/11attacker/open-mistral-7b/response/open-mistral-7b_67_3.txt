Based on the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct, and a 0.2 probability that the witness made an error.

Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, if the witness made an error, it is more likely that the witness misidentified a black person as white, given the population demographics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, considering both the witness's ability to identify race and the population demographics, can be estimated as follows:

1. Probability of witness being correct: 0.8
2. Probability of witness being incorrect and misidentifying a black person as white: 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.03 (since there are fewer black people, the likelihood of a mistake being in this direction is lower)
3. Probability of witness being incorrect and misidentifying a white person as black: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, considering both the witness's ability and the population demographics, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness being incorrect but identifying the attacker as black: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
