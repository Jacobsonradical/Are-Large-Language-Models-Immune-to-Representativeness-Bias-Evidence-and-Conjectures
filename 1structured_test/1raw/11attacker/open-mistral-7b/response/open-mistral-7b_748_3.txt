Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (80% chance). In this case, the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error (20% chance). In this case, the attacker could be white (since the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black), but since the witness is more likely to mistake a black person for white than the other way around, it's more likely that the attacker is still black.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race (if the attacker is black) by the probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness made an error:

Probability of witness correctly identifying attacker's race (if attacker is black) * Probability of attacker being black, given witness error

= 0.8 * (probability of attacker being black / (probability of attacker being black + probability of attacker being white))

We know that the probability of the attacker being white is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. So, the equation becomes:

= 0.8 * (0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85))

Calculating the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's error, we get:

{probability: 0.4}
