Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(H): Prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the proportion of blacks in the city, 0.15.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, 0.8.
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
- P(~H): Prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, which is the proportion of whites in the city, 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.14) = 0.12 / 0.26 = 0.4615

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.
