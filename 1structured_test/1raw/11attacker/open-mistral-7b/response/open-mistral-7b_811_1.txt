To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now let's calculate the probability:

When the witness sees a black person, there is a 0.8 probability that they will correctly identify the person as black (since they're correct 80% of the time).
When the witness sees a white person, there is a 0.2 probability that they will mistake the person for black (since they err 20% of the time).

Given the witness's statement, we assume that the attacker is black. So, we want to find the probability of this event happening, which is the probability of the witness seeing a black person and correctly identifying them as such.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population is black) multiplied by 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time):

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
