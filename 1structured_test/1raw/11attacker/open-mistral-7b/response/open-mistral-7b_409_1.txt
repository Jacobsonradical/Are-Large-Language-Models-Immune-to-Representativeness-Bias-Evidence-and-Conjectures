Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not 100% reliable in identifying race saw the attacker and identified them as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't be sure that the attacker is actually black, as there is a chance that the witness made an error. Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this case and the probability of the attacker being white.

The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 20% (the error rate). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is black is 80%.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is calculated as the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is white divided by the total probability of the witness making an error in both cases:

0.17 / (0.17 + 0.80 * 0.15)

This simplifies to 0.17 / 0.178 = 0.967 or approximately 96.7%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, regardless of the actual race of the person. Since the witness's error rate for identifying white people is higher than for identifying black people (20% vs. 20% * 0.15 = 3%), it's possible that the witness made an error in this case and the attacker is actually white.

Therefore, while it's highly likely that the attacker is white, we cannot be 100% certain, and the most conservative estimate would be that the attacker could be either white or black.

{probability: 0.967, please note that this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case}
