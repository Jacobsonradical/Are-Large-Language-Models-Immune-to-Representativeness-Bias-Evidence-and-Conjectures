Given the information provided, we have two probabilities to consider:

1. The general population distribution in the city: 85% white and 15% black. This is our prior probability.
2. The witness's accuracy in determining race: 80% correct identification and 20% errors.

The witness identified the attacker as black. Since we cannot assume that their identification was incorrect in this specific case, we should consider the probability of the witness making a correct identification.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is the proportion of times they correctly identify a person's race, which is 80%.

Given that the attacker's race is either white or black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
A: the attacker is black
B: the witness identified the attacker as black

Since we cannot calculate P(B), we can rewrite Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B) directly:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Given our information, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and we do not have enough information to calculate P(B|not A) or P(not A).

However, we can make an assumption that the witness's accuracy is the same for both white and black individuals. In this case, P(B|not A) would be equal to 0.8, and P(not A) would be equal to 0.85 (since the overall probability of being white is 0.85).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / 0.48
= 0.25

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.25 or 25%. This is significantly lower than the general population distribution in the city, which suggests that the witness's identification might not be accurate in this specific case.
