Given the information provided, we need to consider two probabilities: the probability that the attacker is actually black (based on the city's demographics) and the probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race.

1. Probability of the attacker being black based on city demographics:

   The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. So, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

2. Probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's race:

   The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white is 0.20 (or 20%), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.80 (or 80%).

3. Combining the probabilities:

   Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use the probability of the witness's correct identification to adjust our initial probability estimate. The probability of both the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the attacker is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%).

   The probability of the attacker being black and the witness misidentifying the attacker as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (or 3%).

   Since the witness's identification is our only piece of evidence, we should consider both cases equally likely. So, the final estimate is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (or 15%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (or 15%).
