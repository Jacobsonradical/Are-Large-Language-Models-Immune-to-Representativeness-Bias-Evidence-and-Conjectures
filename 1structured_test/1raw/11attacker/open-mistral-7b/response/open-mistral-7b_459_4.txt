To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race but errs 20% of the time, we can interpret this as a binomial probability problem. If we assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race, the probability of the attacker being black would be lower than the actual racial composition of the city.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability of the attacker being black (the quantity we aim to estimate)
- q as the probability of the attacker being white
- e as the error probability of the witness (0.2)

Since the total population is 85% white and 15% black, we can write down the equation:
p + q = 1

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can also write down the equation:
p * (1 - e) + q * e = 0.8 (the witness's success rate in identifying the attacker's race)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. Solving this system of equations numerically, we find that:

p â‰ˆ 0.135 (probability that the attacker is black)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 13.5%.
