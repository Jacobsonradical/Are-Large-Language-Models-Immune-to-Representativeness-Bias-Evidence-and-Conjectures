To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is black.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- π(A): Prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony).
- π(W|A): Likelihood of W given A (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black).
- π(W|~A): Likelihood of W given not-A (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black).
- π(~A): Prior probability of not-A (probability of the attacker being non-black).

We are given the following information:
π(A) = ? (we want to find this)
π(W|A) = 0.8
π(W|~A) = 0.2
π(~A) = 0.85 (given in the information)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate π(A|W) as follows:

π(A|W) = π(W|A) * π(A) / [π(W|A) * π(A) + π(W|~A) * π(~A)]

We can rewrite the equation to solve for π(A):

π(A|W) = (0.8 * π(A)) / [(0.8 * π(A)) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now we have an equation with one unknown, π(A). To find a numerical value for π(A), we would need additional information or make an assumption about the prior probability of the attacker being black, π(A). Without this information, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as the answer. However, I can show the equation and explain how to use it to compute an estimate of π(A) if such information becomes available.
