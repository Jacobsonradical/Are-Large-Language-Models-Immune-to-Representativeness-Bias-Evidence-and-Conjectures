The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness's identification given the attacker being black (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence B (probability of the witness identifying someone as black)

Given that we are given the prior probability of the attacker being black and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, we can calculate the probability of the evidence B.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))

Since we don't have the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person (P(B|not A)), we can't directly calculate P(B). However, we do know that P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

So we can rewrite P(B) as:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
