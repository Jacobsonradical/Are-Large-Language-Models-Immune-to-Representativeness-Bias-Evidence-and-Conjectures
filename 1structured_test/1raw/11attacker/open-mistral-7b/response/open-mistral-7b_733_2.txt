Given the information provided, the population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not infallible, identified the attacker as black with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can consider the witness's biased observations. If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify him as black 20% of the time. On the other hand, if the attacker was black, the witness would correctly identify him 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness misidentifies a white person as black is then P(white) * 0.20. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is P(black) * 0.80.

The observed probability that the witness identified the attacker as black is equal to the sum of these two probabilities:

0.80 * P(black) = 0.20 * P(white) + 0.80 * P(black)

Since the population is composed of 85% whites and 15% blacks, we have P(white) = 0.85 and P(black) = 0.15. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.80 * 0.15 = 0.20 * 0.85 + 0.80 * 0.15

Solving this equation, we find that P(black) â‰ˆ 0.25.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
