Given the information provided, here's how to approach the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * P(black).

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability that the witness misidentifies a black person as white is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is:

P(black) = P(witness correctly identifies black) / (P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness mistakenly identifies white as black))

P(black) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03)
P(black) = 0.12 / 0.15
P(black) = 0.8

So, based on the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).
