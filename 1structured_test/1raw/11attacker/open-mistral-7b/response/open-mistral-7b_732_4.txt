Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if the witness's identification was correct or not, as the victim could not see the attacker's race.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. But this information does not directly relate to the witness's ability to identify race.

Without knowing if the witness's identification was correct or not, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate. Therefore, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as the answer.
