To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can model this as a binomial distribution. The probability of correctly identifying a black person (p) is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person (q) is 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker was indeed black, the event occurs with probability p = 0.8. If the attacker was white, the event occurs with probability q = 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to know the actual race of the attacker. All we know is that the witness identified the attacker as black. Given this, the probability that the attacker is black (P(attacker is black)) is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person, given that they identified someone as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as:

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness identified as black)

We are given P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy) and P(attacker is black) = ? (the probability we are trying to calculate).

We also know P(witness identified as black) = P(witness identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identified as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

We are given P(witness identified as black | attacker is white) = 0.2, and we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So P(attacker is white) = 0.85 and P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(witness identified as black):

P(witness identified as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(attacker is black | witness identified as black):

P(attacker is black | witness identified as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48.
