Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 0.8 (or 80%) and their error rate is 0.2 (or 20%). If we assume that the attacker's race is random within the city population, the city's population statistics are as follows: 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given P(B|A) (the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly), P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black), and we need to find P(A|B) (the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification).

We are also given P(B|not A) (the probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black), but we can calculate this from P(B|A) and the total error rate (1 - P(B|A)) because the total error rate includes both misidentifying blacks and misidentifying whites.

So, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (or 20%)

Now, we can calculate P(A):
P(A) = P(black population) = 0.15 (or 15%)

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.13 (or 13%)

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.13 â‰ˆ 0.62 (or 62%)

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.62 (or 62%).
