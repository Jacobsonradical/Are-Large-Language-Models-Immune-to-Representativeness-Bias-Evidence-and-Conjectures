To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the demographics of the city.

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race, but also makes 20% errors.
3. Since we don't have any direct evidence, we should assume an equal probability that the attacker is white or black, given the city's demographics.
4. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than 15%.
5. To estimate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the posterior probability of an event based on prior probability and likelihood:
   P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

   Where:
   - A is the event that the attacker is black
   - B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

6. Let's calculate the values:
   - P(A) = probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (from the city's demographics)
   - P(B|A) = likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black = 0.8 (based on the witness's success rate)
   - P(B|~A) = likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (based on the witness's error rate and the city's demographics)
   - P(B) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.21

7. Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.429

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.429 or 42.9%.
