Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is less than perfectly accurate in identifying race, reported that the attacker was black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as p. We want to find the value of p that maximizes the product of two probabilities: the probability that the attacker is black given the racial composition of the city, and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker.

The probability that the attacker is black given the racial composition of the city is simply the percentage of black people in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is 0.8 (the probability of success) times 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black), which equals 0.12.

Now, let's consider the probability that the witness reports a black attacker when the attacker is actually white. This probability is the percentage of white people in the city, which is 0.85, times the probability that the witness errs, which is 0.2. Therefore, this probability is 0.17.

Since the witness reported a black attacker, we need to find the value of p that maximizes the product of the probability that the attacker is black and the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, subject to the constraint that the probability of the witness reporting a black attacker when the attacker is white is less than or equal to the reported probability of 0.2.

Mathematically, we want to solve the following inequality:

0.15p * 0.12 ≥ 0.2 * (1-p)

Solving this inequality, we find that p ≥ 0.63. However, since the probability of the attacker being black must be between 0 and 1, we can conclude that the attacker is likely black, with an estimate of probability 0.63 or higher.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.63, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
