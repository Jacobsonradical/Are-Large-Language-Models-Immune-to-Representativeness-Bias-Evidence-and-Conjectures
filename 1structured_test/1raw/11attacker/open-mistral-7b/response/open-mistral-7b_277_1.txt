To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is unknown but can be estimated from the city's population data
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, given by the witness's ability to judge race
- P(E|~H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, given by the witness's ability to judge race
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black

We can calculate P(~H) from P(H) and the city's population data:
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

We are also given that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.8, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with a probability of 0.2. So, P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.162

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 16.2%.
