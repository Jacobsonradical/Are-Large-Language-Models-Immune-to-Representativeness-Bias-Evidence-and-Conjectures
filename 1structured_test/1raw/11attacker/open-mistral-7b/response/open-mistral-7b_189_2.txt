To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the demographic distribution of races in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.
2. The demographic distribution of races: 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is white
In this case, we want to find the probability that an incorrect identification by the witness leads to the conclusion that the attacker is black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is 0.2. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white given the misidentification is 0.85.

Scenario 2: The attacker is black
In this case, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8. Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of the attacker being black given the correct identification is 0.15.

Since the witness's statement suggests that the attacker is black, we should consider both scenarios and find the weighted probability of the attacker being black. The weighted probability is the product of the probability of the scenario and the probability of the scenario given the witness's statement.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is:

0.15 * 0.8 (correct identification) + 0.85 * 0.2 (misidentification) = 0.12 + 0.017 = 0.137 or 13.7%

However, given the information that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time, it seems more reasonable that the attacker is actually black, rather than interpreting the probability as a strict 13.7%. Therefore, it is estimated that the probability that the attacker is black is around 80%.
