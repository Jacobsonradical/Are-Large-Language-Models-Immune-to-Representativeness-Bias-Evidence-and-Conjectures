To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying race)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

We have the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  Here, ~H means "not black," and P(~H) = 0.85. We do not have a direct value for P(E|~H), but we can calculate it as 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2.
  So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12

However, this result seems incorrect because the probability should be between 0 and 1. It appears that the witness's accuracy was given as a percentage, not a probability. Let's assume that the witness's accuracy is a true probability, and the 80% should be interpreted as 0.8.

With this assumption, we can re-calculate the probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(H) = 0.15
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.16 â‰ˆ 0.5

So, given the witness's statement, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5 or 50%.
