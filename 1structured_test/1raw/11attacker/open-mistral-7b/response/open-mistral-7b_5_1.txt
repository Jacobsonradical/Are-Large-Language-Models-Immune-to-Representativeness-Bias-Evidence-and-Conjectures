Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

We can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by considering the witness's error rate and the population composition.

If the attacker was white, there is a 85% chance that the witness would correctly identify them as white (given the witness's 80% accuracy). However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, which means the actual attacker must be in the 20% error group.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is the error rate in the witness's identification, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
