To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)): 15% (from the city's population statistics)
2. Probability of the witness stating 'black' given that the attacker is black (P(E|H)): The witness was correct 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8
3. Probability of the witness stating 'black' given that the attacker is not black (P(E|~H)): The witness was incorrect 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2
4. Probability of the witness stating 'black' (P(E)): This is the weighted average of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), multiplied by their respective probabilities. P(E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] + [P(E|~H) * P(~H)] = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness statement:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.15 = 0.6

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.6 or 60%.
