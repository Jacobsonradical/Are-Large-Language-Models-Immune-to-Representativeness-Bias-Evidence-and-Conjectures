To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 0.8 or 80%)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person (complementary probability, since P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A): 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.17)
- P(~B) as the probability that the witness does not identify the attacker as black (1 - P(B): 0.2)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.2]

Calculating, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 0.385, or 38.5%.
