To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black.
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness making this identification given that the attacker is black.

From the information provided, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(A) is the probability we want to find
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
  P(not A) = 1 - P(A)

We are given that 85% of the population is white, so P(not A) = 0.15. Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))
= 0.8P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can solve for P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
= [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Let's simplify this equation:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8P(A) + 0.17)

To find the probability P(A), we need to solve this equation for P(A). However, without more information, it's not possible to provide a numerical answer. We would need to know the value of P(A) to find the probability that the attacker is black.
