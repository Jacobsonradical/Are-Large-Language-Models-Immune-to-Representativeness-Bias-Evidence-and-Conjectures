To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observed evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is whether the attacker is black. The prior probability of this event (P(A)) is the proportion of black people in the city, which we know is 15% (from information b).

The evidence we have is the witness's identification of the attacker as black (E). The probability of this evidence given that the attacker is black (P(E|A)) is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which we know is 80% (from information a).

On the other hand, the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black (P(E|~A)) is the witness's error rate in identifying black people, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.20 or 20% (also from information a).

The total probability of the evidence (P(E)) is the sum of the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is black and the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not black:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(A|E)) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
