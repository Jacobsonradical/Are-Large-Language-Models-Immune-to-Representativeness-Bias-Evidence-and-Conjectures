To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

First, let's define our variables:
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15
- P(W|B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are actually black. This value is given in the information: P(W|B) = 0.8
- P(W|~B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black. This value can be calculated from the given information: P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- P(B|W) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified someone as black. This is what we want to calculate.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.415

So, our estimate, based on the witness's identification, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 41.5%. This is a significantly higher probability than the initial 15% based on the city's demographics, but it's still less than 50% because the witness is not perfect at identifying race.
