To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the victim could not see the attacker's race, the witness's statement should be treated as an error. Therefore, the probability that the witness is incorrect is 20% (the error rate).

On the other hand, the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. Given that the witness made an error, the probability that the error was attributing blackness to a white person is higher because there are more whites in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness made an error and attributed blackness to a white person is P(black) * 0.85 (since there are 0.85 whites in the city). The probability that the witness made an error and attributed blackness to a black person is P(not black) * 0.15 (since there are 0.15 blacks in the city).

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, we have P(black) * 0.85 + P(not black) * 0.15 = 0.2. Solving this equation gives us P(black) = 0.12 and P(not black) = 0.88.

However, given that the witness's statement should be treated as an error, it would be more appropriate to assign an equal probability to both possibilities. Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black as 0.5.
