To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote:
- P(attacker is black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(witness's guess is correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race

From the information given, we know that:
1. P(witness's guess is correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
2. P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) = 1 (since there are only two races: black and white)
3. P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black)

The witness's error rate is 20%, so we can also write:
4. P(witness's guess is incorrect) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Since the witness's guess is independent of the attacker's race, the probability of guessing correctly for a black attacker is the same as for a white attacker:
5. P(witness guesses black | attacker is black) = P(witness guesses black | attacker is white) = P(witness's guess is correct) = 0.8

However, the frequency of black and white people in the city is not equal. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can write:
6. P(attacker is black) = 0.15

Now we can find P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 0.85

Given the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black can be calculated as follows:

P(witness guesses black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness guesses black | attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness guesses black | attacker is white)

Since P(witness guesses black | attacker is black) = P(witness guesses black | attacker is white) = 0.8, we have:

P(witness guesses black) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.12

However, we made an error in our calculations. The witness's guess is independent of the attacker's race, so the correct equation should be:

P(witness guesses black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness guesses black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness guesses black)

So,

P(witness guesses black) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.21

Finally, since the witness guessed black, the probability that the attacker is black is:
