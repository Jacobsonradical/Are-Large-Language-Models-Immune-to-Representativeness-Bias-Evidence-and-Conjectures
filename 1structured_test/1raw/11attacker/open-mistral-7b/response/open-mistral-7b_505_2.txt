To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a black person as white and vice versa, then the probability that the witness is correct when they identify someone as black is 0.8 (80%) and the probability that they are incorrect is 0.2 (20%).

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. The probability that the witness is incorrect when they identify a person as black is 0.2, so the probability that the person they identified as black is actually white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when they identify someone as black, the probability that the person they identified as black is actually black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness is incorrect when they identify a white person as black. The probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 0.15, so the probability that the witness is correct when they identify a person as white is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68. The probability that the witness is incorrect when they identify a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when they identify someone as white, the probability that the person they identified as black is actually white and the witness made an error is 0.03 * 0.85 = 0.026.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities that the witness is correct and that they are incorrect but the attacker is actually white: 0.12 + 0.026 = 0.146.

However, since we cannot rule out the possibility that the witness is completely wrong and the attacker is actually white, we should also consider this as a possibility. If the witness is always wrong and the attacker is actually white, then the probability that the attacker is white is 1. Therefore, the lower bound on the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15, and the upper bound is 0.146.

Given the uncertainty and limitations of the information, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be somewhere between 0.15 and 0.146. However, without more information, a precise estimate is not possible.
