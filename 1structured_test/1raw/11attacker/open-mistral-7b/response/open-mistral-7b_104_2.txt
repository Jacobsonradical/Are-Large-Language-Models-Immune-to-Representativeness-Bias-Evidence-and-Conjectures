Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's mistake in this case (identifying the attacker as black) could potentially be an error in the opposite direction (mistaking a white person for black). Without knowing the specific error distribution between the two types of mistakes (misidentifying a black person as white and vice versa), we cannot accurately calculate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's statement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate between 0 and 1 for the attacker's race. A more detailed investigation or additional information would be necessary to make a more informed estimate.
