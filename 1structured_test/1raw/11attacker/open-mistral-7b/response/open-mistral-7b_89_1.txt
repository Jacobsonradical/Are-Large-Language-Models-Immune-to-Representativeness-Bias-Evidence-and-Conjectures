Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this case.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case,
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 15% (the population proportion of black people)
- P(B|A) = 100% (since the witness is always correct when the attacker is black)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is not black)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the population proportion of white people)

We do not have the value of P(B) directly, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.245

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [0.245] â‰ˆ 0.608

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 0.608 or 60.8%.
