Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we do not have direct evidence of the witness's observation of the attacker's race. We only have the witness's general ability to identify race.

The population statistics provided in point b indicate that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. Without knowing the context or specific circumstances of the witness's observation, it's not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the witness's general ability and the city's demographics.

Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate within the requested format. This situation requires more specific information to make a reliable estimate.
