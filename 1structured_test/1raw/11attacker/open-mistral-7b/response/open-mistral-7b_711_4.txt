To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

First, let's calculate the expected number of correct identifications for a white person and a black person, given the witness's accuracy.

1. For a white person: The witness correctly identifies white 80% of the time, so the expected number of correct identifications is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4. The expected number of incorrect identifications is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

2. For a black person: The witness correctly identifies black 80% of the time, so the expected number of correct identifications is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4. The expected number of incorrect identifications is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Now, let's consider the racial composition of the city's population. Since 85% of the population is white, the expected number of white people in the sample is 0.85 * N (where N is the total number of people in the sample). Since 15% of the population is black, the expected number of black people in the sample is 0.15 * N.

Given that the witness's identification is biased, we can expect that the actual number of correct identifications for white people will be higher than the expected number of correct identifications, and the actual number of correct identifications for black people will be lower than the expected number of correct identifications.

Let Cw be the actual number of correct identifications for white people, and Cb be the actual number of correct identifications for black people. We can write two equations:

1. Cw = 0.4 * 0.85N + 0.1 * 0.15N + error (where error represents the difference between the actual and expected number of incorrect identifications for white people)
2. Cb = 0.4 * 0.15N + 0.1 * 0.85N - error (where error represents the difference between the actual and expected number of incorrect identifications for black people)

Since the total number of correct identifications is Cw + Cb, we can write another equation:

3. Cw + Cb = 0.8 * 0.5N

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the number of black people in the sample (Cb). Once we have Cb, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black by dividing Cb by the total number of people in the sample (N).

Unfortunately, without the actual sample size (N), we cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black. However, we can say that the probability is likely to be less than 0.15 (15%) due to the witness's bias towards identifying people as black. If the bias is strong enough, the actual number of correct identifications for black people (Cb) could be less than the expected number of correct identifications, which would result in a lower probability that the attacker is black.
