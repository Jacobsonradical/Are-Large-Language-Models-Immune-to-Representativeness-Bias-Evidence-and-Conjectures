To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city where the attack occurred.

The witness's reliability is 80% for correctly identifying a person's race, and 20% for erring. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect, and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white, and the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

This means that there is a 100% - 17% = 83% chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is black. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
