Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using the Bayes' theorem.

The Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, the events are:
1. A: The attacker is black.
2. B: The witness identified a black person as the attacker.

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is given as 15% (0.15). The probability of B given A (P(B|A)) is assumed to be 1, as the attacker is indeed black, and we don't have information to the contrary.

The probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)) is given as 0.2 (20%), as the witness errs in identifying the race 20% of the time. The probability of not A (P(not A)) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

The probability of A given B (P(A|B)) is what we're trying to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 1 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8)
       = 0.15 / 0.24
       = 0.625

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.625 or 62.5%.
