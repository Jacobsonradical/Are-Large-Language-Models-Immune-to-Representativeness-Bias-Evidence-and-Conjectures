Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that a black person would be mistakenly identified as white by the witness)
- P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (the probability that a white person would be mistakenly identified as black by the witness)
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)

Let's break this down:

1. Prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)): 15% (from the city's population statistics)
2. Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)): The witness incorrectly identifies black people as white 20% of the time. So, the probability they correctly identify a black person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
3. Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (P(E|~H)): The witness incorrectly identifies white people as black 20% of the time. So, the probability they correctly identify a white person is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
4. Prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (P(~H)): 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 16%. This means that there is still a higher probability that the attacker is white, but the witness's identification of the attacker as black does increase the probability that the attacker is black.
