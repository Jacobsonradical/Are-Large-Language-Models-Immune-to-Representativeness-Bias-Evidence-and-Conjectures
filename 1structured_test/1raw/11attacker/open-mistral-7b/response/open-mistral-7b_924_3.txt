Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, and it allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is black"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black"

We are given P(B|A) (probability of witness identifying attacker as black given that attacker is black) and P(A) (probability of attacker being black), but we need to find P(B) (probability of witness identifying attacker as black) and P(B|A') (probability of witness identifying attacker as black given that attacker is not black).

From the information provided, we can calculate P(B|A) = 0.8 (80%) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population).

We are told that the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means that when the attacker is white, the witness will mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A') = 0.2 (20%).

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' represents the event "the attacker is not black" (which is the complement of A). Since the total population is 85% white, P(A') = 0.85 (85%).

Using the given values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.341

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.341 or 34.1%.
