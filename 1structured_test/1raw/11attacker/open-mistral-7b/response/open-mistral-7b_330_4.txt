Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect at identifying races, correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time and erroneously identified it 20% of the time.

However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that the witness's incorrect identification was made 20% of the time. Since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can calculate this by inverting the error rate.

The probability that the witness errs in identifying a white person as black is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct in identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the witness claimed that the attacker was black, and they are correct 80% of the time when they make such a claim, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually black is 0.80.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.80}
