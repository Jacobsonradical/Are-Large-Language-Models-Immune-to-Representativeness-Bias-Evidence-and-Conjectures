Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker's race (black or white), and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(witness said black | attacker is black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(witness said black | attacker is white) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black

From the information provided, we know that P(black) = 0.15, P(white) = 0.85, P(witness said black | attacker is black) = 0.8, and P(witness said black | attacker is white) = 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is:

P(attacker is black | witness said black) = [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black)] / [P(witness said black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness said black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness said black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.33 or 33%.
