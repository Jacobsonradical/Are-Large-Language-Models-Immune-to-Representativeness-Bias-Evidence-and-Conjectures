Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is random and follows the city's demographic distribution (85% white and 15% black), we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we can estimate from the city's demographic distribution), and P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black (which we know is 80%).

The prior probability of the attacker being black can be estimated as follows:

P(A) = Number of black people / Total number of people
    = 0.15 * Total population
    = 0.15 * 1000 (assuming the total population is 1000 for simplicity)
    = 150

The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is indeed black can be estimated as follows:

P(B|A) = Witness accuracy
        = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.8 * 150 / (0.8 * 150 + 0.2 * 850)
      = 0.8 * 150 / (120 + 170)
      = 0.8 * 150 / 290
      = 0.5172

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.5172 or 51.72%.
