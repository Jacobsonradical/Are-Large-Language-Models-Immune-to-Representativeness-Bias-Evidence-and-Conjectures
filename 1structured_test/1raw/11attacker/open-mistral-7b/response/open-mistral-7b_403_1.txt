To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85.

Given that the witness identifies the race 80% of the time, the probability that they correctly identify a white person is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68. This means that when they say a person is white, they are likely correct 68% of the time.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, the probability that they incorrectly identify a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. This means that when they say a person is black, they are likely incorrect 17% of the time.

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. Since they are likely incorrect 17% of the time when they say a person is black, the actual probability that the attacker is black is lower than the 15% that we would expect based on the racial composition of the city.

To find this probability, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating probabilities in light of new evidence:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15), P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.182).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.182 â‰ˆ 0.126

So, based on the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is around 12.6%. This is significantly lower than the 85% probability that a randomly chosen person is white.
