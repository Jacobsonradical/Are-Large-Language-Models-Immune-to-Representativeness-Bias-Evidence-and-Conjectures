Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race: They are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

However, we should note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black might not necessarily reflect the actual race of the attacker. The witness might have made an error in their judgment.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, this probability is 0.8 (or 0.80).
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the proportion of blacks in the city, which is 0.15 (or 0.15).
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black. Since there are twice as many whites as blacks in the city, the probability of the witness picking a white person is 0.85 (or 0.85), and the probability of picking a black person is 0.15 (or 0.15). Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.12 (or 0.12 = 0.15 * 0.8).

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.15)
= 0.12 / 0.13
â‰ˆ 0.923

So, based on the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city, we estimate that there is a 92.3% probability that the attacker is black. However, it's important to remember that this is an estimate, and the true probability could be different due to factors not accounted for in this analysis, such as the accuracy of the witness's identification or the possibility that the witness was biased or mistaken.
