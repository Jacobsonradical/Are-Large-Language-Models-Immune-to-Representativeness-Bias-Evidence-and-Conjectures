To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen clearly, we should consider both the correct identification and the error as possibilities.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (15% of the population is black, and the witness errs 20% of the time).

So, the total probability of the attacker being identified as black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83 (around 83%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
