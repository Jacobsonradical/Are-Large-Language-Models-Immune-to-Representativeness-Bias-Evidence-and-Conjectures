Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying race, correctly identified as black 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

However, without knowing the exact number of times the witness identified the race, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement.

To estimate the probability, we can make an assumption that the witness saw an equal number of black and white people in their sample, which is not indicated in the information provided. If we assume that, then the 80% correct identifications of the witness as black could be a mix of true black individuals and mistaken white individuals identified as black.

To account for this, we can calculate the proportion of correctly identified black individuals among the total number of black individuals the witness saw. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that 20% of the time they mistakenly identified a white person as black. So, if the witness saw an equal number of black and white people, then 80% of the time they identified a black person correctly, and 20% of the time they mistakenly identified a white person as black.

Let's denote the total number of black people the witness saw as X. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the number of white people the witness saw is 0.85X. The witness correctly identified 0.8X black people and mistakenly identified 0.04X white people as black.

The total number of correct black identifications is 0.8X. So, the number of true black individuals the witness saw is 0.8X - 0.04X = 0.76X.

The proportion of correct black identifications among the true number of black individuals is therefore 0.8X / 0.76X. Since we are looking for a probability, we need to convert this proportion into a number between 0 and 1.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.8X / 0.76X = 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.8, where X is the total number of black people the witness saw.

Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot provide a specific value for X and therefore can't provide a precise probability. However, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8.
