To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence: the witness's testimony
- P(H): The prior probability of the hypothesis, i.e., the probability that the attacker is black before considering the evidence
- P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, i.e., the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(E|~H): The likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, i.e., the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black
- P(~H): The prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, i.e., the probability that the attacker is not black

From the information given, we know P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time), and P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time).

We don't have direct information about P(~H), but we can calculate it using the given information and Bayes' theorem:

P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis, P(H|E), using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 24%. This mean that, based on this evidence, the attacker is more likely to be white (76%) than black. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on a single piece of evidence and may not fully represent the true probability. Further investigation and evidence would be needed to make a more conclusive determination.
