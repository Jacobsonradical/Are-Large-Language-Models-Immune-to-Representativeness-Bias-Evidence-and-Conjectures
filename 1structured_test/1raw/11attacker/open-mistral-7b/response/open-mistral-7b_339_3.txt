Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness, in similar conditions, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

We can't directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this case because the attacker's race was not observed under the same conditions. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E is given by P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the observed evidence that a witness, with given abilities, identified the attacker as black.

We have P(H) = 0.15 (15% population is black), P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% witness accuracy in identifying blacks), and we can assume P(E|not H) = 0.2 (20% witness error in not identifying blacks). However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(E).

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(E), we cannot provide an exact probability estimate. But we can say that the witness's identification increases the likelihood that the attacker is black, and the attacker being black is still a minority in the population. Therefore, it's reasonable to believe that the attacker is more likely to be black than white, but the exact probability cannot be determined based on the given information.
