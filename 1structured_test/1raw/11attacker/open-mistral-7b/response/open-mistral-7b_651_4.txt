To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. Racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black, even if the attacker was white. This will allow us to find the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

The probability that the witness mistakes a white person for a black person is the error rate of the witness: 0.20

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is the reliability rate of the witness multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is the error rate of the witness: 0.20

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black:

P(Witness correctly identifies attacker as black | Attacker is black) = P(Attacker is black) * P(Witness correctly identifies black person) / (P(Witness correctly identifies black person) + P(Witness mistakes white person as black))

P(Witness correctly identifies attacker as black | Attacker is black) = 0.15 * 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20) = 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.375 (or 37.5%). This means that there is a 37.5% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.
