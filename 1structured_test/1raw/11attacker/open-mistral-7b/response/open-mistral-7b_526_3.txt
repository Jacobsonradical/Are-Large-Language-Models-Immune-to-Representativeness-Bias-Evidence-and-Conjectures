Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The witness's ability to identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2) The distribution of races in the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both pieces of information. The witness's identification is not perfect, so we need to account for that error rate.

If the attacker was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. Conversely, if the attacker was black, the witness would correctly identify them 80% of the time.

Given that the city has a 85% white and 15% black population, we can calculate the probability of each event:

a) Probability of witness misidentifying a white person as black: 0.85 (probability of a white person) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%)
b) Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person: 0.15 (probability of a black person) * 0.80 (correct identification rate) = 0.12 (or 12%)

Now, we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying a black person, either correctly or incorrectly. We can do this by adding the probabilities from parts a) and b):

Total probability of witness identifying a black person: 0.17 (a) + 0.12 (b) = 0.29 (or 29%)

However, since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are only interested in the probability of the correct identification (part b). So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%).

In dictionary format: {probability: 0.12}
