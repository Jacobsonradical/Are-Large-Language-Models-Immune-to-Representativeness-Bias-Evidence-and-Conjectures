Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If the attacker's race is actually black, the witness would correctly identify them as such 80% of the time. If the attacker's race is white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

The total probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race, is the probability of misidentifying a white person as black times the proportion of white people in the city. Since the witness misidentifies white people as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability of misidentifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as such minus the probability of misidentifying a white person as black: 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63 or 63%.
