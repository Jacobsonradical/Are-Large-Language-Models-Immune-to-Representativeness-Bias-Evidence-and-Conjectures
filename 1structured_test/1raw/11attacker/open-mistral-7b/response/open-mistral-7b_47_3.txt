To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (this is the accuracy of the witness in this case)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's testimony)

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being black is 15%)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (total probability of the witness's testimony)
  P(~H) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 85%)
  P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time)

We can compute P(E) as follows:
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Now we can compute P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.4

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4, or 40%. This means that, given the witness's testimony, there is a 40% chance that the attacker is black and a 60% chance that the attacker is white. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on the given information and assumptions, and the actual probability may be different.
