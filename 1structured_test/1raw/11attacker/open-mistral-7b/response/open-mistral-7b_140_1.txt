To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We have two pieces of information:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: P(A|B) = 0.8 (80%), P(not A|B) = 0.2 (20%)
2. The demographic distribution of the city: P(A) = 0.15 (15%), P(not A) = 0.85 (85%)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
