Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case:
- H is the event that the attacker is black.
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a black person correctly, which is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observed identification, which is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person.

Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 1 - 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.13.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.13 â‰ˆ 0.69

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.69 or 69%.
