To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the original population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the attacker being white is then P(white) = 1 - P(black).

The witness's report of the attacker being black can be seen as a binomial event, where the number of successes (correctly identifying a black person) is 1, the number of trials is the total number of people the witness saw, and the probability of success is P(black).

However, we do not have the exact number of people the witness saw or the exact number of times they correctly identified a black person. We only know that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the witness saw more white people than black people, since they are more common. If the witness saw a large enough number of people, they are likely to make more than one mistake in identifying a black person as white (given their 20% error rate).

Therefore, the witness's report that the attacker is black is not strong enough evidence to conclude that the attacker is definitely black. It could be an error.

To estimate P(black), we would need to know more about the number of people the witness saw and the number of times they correctly identified a black person. Without this information, we cannot provide a specific number between 0 and 1 as the estimate of P(black).

However, we can say that given the witness's error rate and the fact that they identified the attacker as black, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black, because the population is mostly white. But without more information, we cannot quantify this difference in probabilities.

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: cannot be determined with the given information}
