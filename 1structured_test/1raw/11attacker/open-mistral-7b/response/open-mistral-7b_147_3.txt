To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as P(witness_correct). Then, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white attacker as P(witness_mistake) = 1 - P(witness_correct).

We know that the probability of a random attacker being black is P(black_attacker) = 0.15. Given the witness's ability, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is P(witness_correct) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness making a mistake in this case is P(witness_mistake) = 1 - P(witness_correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

The witness reported that the attacker was black. Given the witness's error rate, the probability that the witness is reporting the truth is the probability that the attacker is black times the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, plus the probability that the witness makes a mistake and incorrectly identifies a white attacker times the probability of a white attacker being misidentified as black.

So, P(attacker_is_black|witness_report) = P(black_attacker) * P(witness_correct) + P(not_black_attacker) * P(witness_mistake) * P(witness_mistake_identifies_black)

Since the probability of a random attacker being white is P(white_attacker) = 0.85, we can calculate P(not_black_attacker) = P(white_attacker) = 0.85.

Given the witness's error rate, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is P(witness_mistake_identifies_black) = P(witness_mistake) * P(white_attacker|witness_mistake) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(attacker_is_black|witness_report) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.17 = 0.164 + 0.034 = 0.198

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is approximately 19.8%.
