To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, the probability that they are correct is 0.8 (80%) and the probability that they are wrong is 0.2 (20%).

However, we need to adjust this probability based on the racial composition of the city. If 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, then the probability that a randomly chosen person is black is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we need to consider both factors. The witness might be correct, in which case the attacker is black. The probability of this is 0.8 (the witness's correct rate). But if the witness is wrong, then the attacker is actually white. The probability of this is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Since there are twice as many white people as black people, the witness being wrong and identifying the attacker as black would imply that the actual attacker is white. So, the probability of this happening is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times 0.85 (the probability of a randomly chosen person being white).

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is black, considering both the witness's accuracy and the racial composition of the city, is 0.8 (the witness's correct rate) minus 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times 0.85 (the probability of a randomly chosen person being white), which equals 0.68 or 68%.
