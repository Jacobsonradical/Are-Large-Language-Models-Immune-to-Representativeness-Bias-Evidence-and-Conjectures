Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect at identifying race, identified the attacker as black with a probability of 80%.

The witness's error rate of 20% means that they misidentify the race 20% of the time. Therefore, when they correctly identify someone's race, it means that person is indeed of that race. So, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time.

Since 15% of the population is black, we can estimate the chance that the witness's identification is correct by multiplying the population's proportion of blacks by the witness's ability to correctly identify blacks.

So, {probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 12%}

However, given the witness's identification, we should also consider the possibility of a false positive. In this case, the witness might have mistakenly identified a white person as black. The probability of a false positive is the witness's error rate (20%) multiplied by the proportion of whites in the population (85%).

So, the probability of a false positive is {probability: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, the attacker is estimated to be black due to a false positive with a probability of 17%}

The total probability of the attacker being black, considering both the correct identification and the false positive, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.29, the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 29%}
