Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black) and the witness's ability to accurately identify race. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we can assume that there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error in this specific case. However, we cannot assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between identifying a black person as white and a white person as black.

Given that the population is heavily dominated by whites (85%), it is more likely that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black than the other way around. To account for this bias, we can adjust the 20% error rate to reflect this imbalance.

Let's assume that the witness is twice as likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black (error type 1) than to incorrectly identify a black person as white (error type 2). This means that error type 1 occurrences account for 1.5 * 20% = 30% of the total errors.

Since the population is 85% white, there are 85 white people for every 15 black people in the city. Therefore, the probability of an error type 1 occurrence is 30% * 85/100 = 0.255 or 25.5%.

This leaves us with 74.5% of errors being error type 2 (incorrectly identifying a black person as white). Since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time, the probability of error type 2 is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probabilities of error type 1 and error type 2:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of error type 1 + Probability of error type 2
                                                      = 0.255 + 0.2
                                                      = 0.455 or 45.5%

However, since we cannot definitively distinguish between error type 1 and error type 2 in this case, it is more conservative to assume that the witness's original 20% error rate applies to both types of errors. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black would be 20%.

Based on this analysis, the probability that the attacker is black is between 20% and 45.5%. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a more precise estimate.
