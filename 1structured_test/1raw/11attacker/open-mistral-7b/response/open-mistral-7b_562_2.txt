To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, if the population is 85% white and 15% black, then the probability of encountering a white person is higher than that of encountering a black person.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(Black). The probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as such is 80% * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event occurring is the sum of the two probabilities we just calculated: P(Black) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 (29%).

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case in real life. If the witness is more likely to err in identifying white people as black than the other way around, the probability of the attacker being black could be higher. Without more specific information, it's challenging to make such an adjustment.

Therefore, based on the given information, the best estimate is a probability of 0.29 (29%) that the attacker is black. However, this estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the potential limitations in the witness's racial identification ability and the assumption that their error rate is constant.
