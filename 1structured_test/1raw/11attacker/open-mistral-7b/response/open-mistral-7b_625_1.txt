Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not reliable 100% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that P(B) + P(W) = 1

The witness identified the attacker as black with a probability of P(B) * Witness's reliability (0.8) + P(W) * Witness's error (0.2) = 0.8P(B) + 0.2P(W)

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the witness had an equal number of white and black people to observe in their sample (half-half). So, the witness's reliability (0.8) is the probability of correctly identifying a black person, and the witness's error (0.2) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

The witness's reliability and error are thus related by:
0.8P(B) + 0.2(1-P(B)) = 0.8

Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.625

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.625 or 62.5%.
