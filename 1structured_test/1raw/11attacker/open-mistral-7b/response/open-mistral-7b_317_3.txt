Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to this specific situation. The witness's accuracy rate is based on a sample of people, but we don't know if the attacker was in that sample or not. Therefore, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

The second piece of information about the racial composition of the city suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white due to the majority population. However, this information also doesn't allow us to make a direct probability estimation because it doesn't take into account the witness's ability to identify races.

Without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate. Therefore, the answer is: {probability: Unable to determine, please provide more information}
