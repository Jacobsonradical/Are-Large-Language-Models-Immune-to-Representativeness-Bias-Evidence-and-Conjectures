To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We have the following information:
- P(H) = 15% (from b)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from a)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (we assume that the witness errs in identifying a white person as black 20% of the time, and there is a 50% chance of the attacker being white)

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is:

{probability: 0.32, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that there is a 32% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information, and actual probabilities may vary based on other factors not considered in this analysis.
