To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city).

Let's denote the following variables:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- W: the racial demographics of the city (85% white, 15% black)

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of population in the city is black)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies black people 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of population in the city is white)

Calculating P(B) gives us:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial demographics of the city, is approximately 0.4828 or 48.28%.
