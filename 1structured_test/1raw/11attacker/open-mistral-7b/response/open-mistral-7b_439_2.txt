Based on the information provided, the population is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is typically correct 80% of the time in identifying race but errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as black. This suggests that the witness may have made an error in this case, given the high proportion of white people in the city.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to account for both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B).

The witness's correct identification rate can be represented as P(B) * Witness_correct + P(not B) * Witness_error, where Witness_correct is the probability of correctly identifying a black person and Witness_error is the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can write this equation as:

0.8 = P(B) * 0.8 + (1 - P(B)) * 0.2

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * (1 - P(B)))
P(B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * P(B))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P(B) = 4 / 5

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is constant and that the witness's error in this case was due to a misunderstanding of the attacker's race, not because the attacker was white. In a real-world scenario, these assumptions may not hold, and the actual probability could be different.
