To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (before considering the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(B) as the total evidence (witness's testimony)

From the provided information, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (total probability of the witness's testimony)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.31

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
