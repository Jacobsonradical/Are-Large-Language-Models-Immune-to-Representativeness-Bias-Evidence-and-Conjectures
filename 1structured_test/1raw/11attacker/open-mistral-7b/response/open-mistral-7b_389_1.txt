Given the information provided, we have a witness who accurately identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot be certain that the witness's identification is correct, as there is a chance they made an error.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as black is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct minus the probability of the witness being wrong.

probability: 0.8

This means that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when they were correct, so we estimate that the attacker is black 80% of the time. However, we must keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the given information and assumptions, and actual outcomes may differ.
