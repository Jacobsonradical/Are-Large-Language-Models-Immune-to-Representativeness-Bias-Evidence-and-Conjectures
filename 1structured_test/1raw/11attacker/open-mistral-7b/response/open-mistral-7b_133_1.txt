To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to know whether the witness's error rate is the same for misidentifying blacks as white or vice versa. Let's assume for simplicity that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two races.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of encountering a white person in the same circumstances as the attack is 0.85. The witness's accuracy in identifying whites is 0.8, so the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person as white is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of the witness erring in identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, let's consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15. The witness's accuracy in identifying blacks is 0.8, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of the witness erring in identifying a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The witness reported that the attacker was black, which corresponds to the witness's error in identifying a white person as black. So, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the witness erring in identifying a white person as black, which is 0.17.

However, we should take into account that the witness might have been mistaken about the race of the attacker. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, there's a 20% chance that the witness misidentified the attacker's race. In this case, the actual attacker could be of any race.

To account for this possibility, we need to consider the overall distribution of races in the city. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report and the racial demographics of the city, is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (0.12) and the probability of the witness erring in identifying a white person as black (0.17), which is 0.29 (29%).

However, we should also consider the possibility of the witness's mistake. If we assume that the witness's mistake is equally likely for any race, the actual probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (0.12) and the probability of the witness's mistake (0.2), which is 0.32 (32%).

In summary, based on the given information, the most likely estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is between 0.29 (29%) and 0.32 (32%). This estimate is subject to the assumption that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between the two races and that the witness's mistake is equally likely for any race.
