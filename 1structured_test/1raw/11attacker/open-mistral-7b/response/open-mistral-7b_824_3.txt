To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information given and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.

1. We know from the witness's ability that they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
2. In the population, 85% are white and 15% are black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that they are correct can be calculated as the proportion of black people in the population multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying blacks:

probability = (proportion of black people) * (witness's success rate in identifying blacks)
                       = (0.15) * (0.8)
                       = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This means there is an 88% chance that the witness made an error in their identification.
