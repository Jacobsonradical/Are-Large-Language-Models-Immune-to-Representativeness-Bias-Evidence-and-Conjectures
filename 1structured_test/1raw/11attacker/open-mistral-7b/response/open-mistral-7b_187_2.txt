The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the information provided, would be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, has a 20% error rate in identifying races. This means that when the witness sees a white person, they incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.
3. Therefore, even if the attacker was white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as black.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, let's consider two scenarios:
   a) The attacker is actually black. In this case, we would expect the witness to correctly identify the race. The probability of this scenario is 15% (the probability of the attacker being black in the population).
   b) The attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black due to their error rate. The probability of this scenario is 85% (the probability of the attacker being white in the population) multiplied by the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (20%).
5. To find the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we add the probabilities of both scenarios: 15% (scenario a) + 0.2 * 85% (scenario b) = 15% + 17% = 32%.

However, this calculation assumes that the error rate of the witness is constant, which may not be the case. If the witness is more likely to err when it's dark or when they are under stress (as it would be during an attack), the error rate could be higher. Without more information, we can only provide the calculation based on the given data.

{probability: 0.32, please note that this calculation relies on certain assumptions about the witness's error rate and may not accurately reflect the true probability in real-world situations}
