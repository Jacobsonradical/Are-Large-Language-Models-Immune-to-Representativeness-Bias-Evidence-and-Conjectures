To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.
2. In this case, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, there is a 80% chance that the attacker is actually black (true positive).
3. However, if the witness identifies the attacker as white, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually black (false negative).
4. The total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false negative, weighted by their occurrence.

Let's denote the probability of a false negative as P(FN). Since the probability of a true positive is 0.8, we can write:

0.8 = P(TP) + P(FN) * (1 - P(TP))

Where P(TP) is the probability of a true positive, which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as black, given that the attacker is black.

We know that P(TP) = 0.8, and we can calculate P(FN) by using the information about the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the population.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, and the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of a false negative is then P(FN) = 0.17 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.21.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

0.8 * P(TP) + 0.21 * P(FN) = 0.64 + 0.042 = 0.682

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.682 or 68.2%.
