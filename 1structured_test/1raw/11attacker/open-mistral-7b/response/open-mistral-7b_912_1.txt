Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If the attacker's race was white, the witness would incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

The probability of the attacker being black, given that the witness identified them as black, is the probability of a correct identification by the witness plus the probability of an error in the opposite direction (a white person being misidentified as black). So, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.2 (witness's error rate) + 0.17 (probability of witness misidentifying white attacker as black) = 0.37 (or 37%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.37} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
