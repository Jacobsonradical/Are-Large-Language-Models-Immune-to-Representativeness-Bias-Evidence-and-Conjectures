To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is "The attacker is black," and the evidence is "The witness identified the attacker as black."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black,
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black,
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black,
- P(A|B) as the probability of the event "witness identifies black person as black" given that the attacker is black,
- P(not A|B) as the probability of the event "witness identifies black person as black" given that the attacker is not black.

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|not A) = 0.2, and P(A) = ? (the probability we want to find).

Given that the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can compute P(not A) as the probability that the attacker is not black:

P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of being white)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Solving this equation for P(A) will give us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

However, without a calculator or solving the equation, it's difficult to give an exact number. But based on the given information, it's clear that the probability P(A) should be higher than 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city). The exact value will depend on the specific numbers in the equation.
