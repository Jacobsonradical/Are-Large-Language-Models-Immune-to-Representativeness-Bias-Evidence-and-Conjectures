To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given the witness's reliability in identifying race, they are correct 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black, but rather that the witness has made a correct identification.

On the other hand, the racial composition of the city's population, as provided in the second piece of information, is 85% white and 15% black.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black as follows:

1. The probability that the witness makes a correct identification of a black person is 0.8 (from the first piece of information).
2. The probability that the attacker is black is the product of the witness making a correct identification and the probability that the attacker is actually black in the population.
3. The probability that the attacker is actually black in the population is 0.15 (from the second piece of information).
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness could have also made a mistake and identified a white person as black. The probability that the witness makes an error in identifying a white person is 0.2 (from the first piece of information).

5. The probability that the witness makes an error in identifying a white person and the attacker is indeed white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.
6. Since we cannot distinguish between the two errors (witness identifying a black person as white or a white person as black), we add the two probabilities to find the overall probability that the attacker is indeed black: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

In summary, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 29%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.
