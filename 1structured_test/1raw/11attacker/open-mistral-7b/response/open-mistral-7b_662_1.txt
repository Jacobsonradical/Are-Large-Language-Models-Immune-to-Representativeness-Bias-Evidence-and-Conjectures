To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If the witness saw a random person from the city, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the person's race as black is 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city).

However, the witness saw the attacker and identified them as black. Since the witness is not perfectly reliable, there's a chance that the witness made a mistake. The probability of this mistake is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02 (given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies the race, and 20% of the time they err, the probability of erring on a white person is 0.2 * 0.15).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability that the witness correctly identified the race plus the probability of a mistake, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is black given they were identified as such.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identified the race) + 0.02 (the probability of a mistake) * 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is white given they were identified as black) = 0.8 + 0.003 = 0.803.

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can round it to 0.8.
