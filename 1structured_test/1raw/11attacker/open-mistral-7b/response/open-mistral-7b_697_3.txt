To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the composition of the population in the city.

The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% (correctly identifying race) and 20% (making an error). Since we don't have specific information about the race of the attacker, we can assume that the witness's mistakes could be equally distributed between black and white individuals.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the witness making a mistake by misidentifying a black person as white is 20% * 15% = 0.03 or 3%.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness making a mistake by misidentifying a white person as black is 20% * 85% = 0.17 or 17%.

Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, the witness is more likely to make an error by misidentifying a white person as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 80%.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness could be biased or mistaken. In a real-world scenario, it would be important to collect more information and evidence to make a more accurate estimate.

Since we cannot make a fully accurate estimate without more information, we will provide an estimate based on the given information:
