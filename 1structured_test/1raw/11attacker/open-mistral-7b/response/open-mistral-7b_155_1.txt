Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The city population is 85% white and 15% black. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we need to consider the witness's error rate as well.

Let's assume the attacker is actually white. In this case, there's a 85% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as black due to the error rate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's mistake, is 15% (the actual proportion of black people in the city).

Now, let's assume the attacker is actually black. In this case, there's a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify them as white due to their error rate. The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black in this case is 80%.

Since we don't have any other information, we can't assign a higher probability to one assumption over the other. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black should be the same as the probability that they are white, given the witness's error rate.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%), and the probability that the attacker is white is also 0.15 (15%). However, these probabilities are conditional on the witness's error rate, and they don't account for other possible factors that could have influenced the witness's identification. Therefore, a more accurate estimate might require additional information.
