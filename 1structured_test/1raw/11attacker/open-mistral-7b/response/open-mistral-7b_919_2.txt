Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given by the witness's ability: P(W|B) = 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (complementary to P(W|B): P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of an attacker being non-black (complementary to P(B): P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(B|W) of an attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is given by:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
