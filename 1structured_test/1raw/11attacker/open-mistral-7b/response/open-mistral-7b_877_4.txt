To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of attacker being black given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of attacker being black before any evidence)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (probability of the witness's identification before any evidence)

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(A) (probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black)
2. P(B|A) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black) = 0.8 (given that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases)
3. P(A|B) (probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification) is what we want to find

Now, we can calculate P(B) (probability of the witness's identification):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we don't have information about P(B|not A) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black), we can't calculate an exact value for P(B). However, we can make an assumption based on the given information.

Assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can assume that P(B|not A) is equal to P(B|A) = 0.8. This is a simplifying assumption and may not be accurate in real life, but it allows us to calculate a rough estimate.

With this assumption, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15

So, based on the given information and the simplifying assumption, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%. This is less than the 80% accuracy of the witness, which suggests that the witness's identification is likely to be an error in this case. Again, this is a rough estimate and should be treated with caution due to the simplifying assumption.
