To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is random within the city's population, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is actually black is the same as the probability of erring when the attacker is white.

Let P(Black) be the probability that the attacker is black and P(White) be the probability that the attacker is white. We have:

P(Witness identifies Black | Black) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
P(Witness identifies Black | White) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability)

Since the witness identifies the attacker as black, we have the following equation:

0.8 * P(Black) + 0.2 * P(White) = 1

We also know that the total population is 85% white and 15% black, so:

P(White) + P(Black) = 1

P(White) = 0.85 and P(Black) = 1 - P(White) = 0.15

Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 1

Solving this equation, we find that P(Black) = 0.12 (or 12%). However, since the witness's reliability is based on a sample that may not be representative of the city's population, this estimate may not be accurate. It's important to note that this calculation assumes that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's ability to identify race, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this calculation should be interpreted with caution.
