Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The racial makeup of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not necessarily accurate in identifying races, stated that the attacker was black. This witness was shown a 50-50 mix of white and black people and correctly identified the race 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). We also know the probability that the witness is incorrect in identifying the race of a person as P(Error). Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, we can write this event as P(Error) = 1 - P(Black).

The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so P(Correct) = 0.8. Since there are two types of people (white and black), and the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, it means that the witness correctly identified a black person 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%) of the time.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random person being white is P(White) = 0.85. Therefore, the probability of a random person being black is P(Black) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identified a black person 0.12 times, so the probability that the witness was right when they said the attacker was black is 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.8.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can now write the equation:

P(Error) = 1 - P(Black) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

We know that:
P(Error) = 1 - P(Black)
0.8 = 1 - P(Black)
P(Black) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

But we also know that:
P(Correct) = 0.8
P(Black) * P(Correct | Black) = P(Correct)
0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Since both calculations give us the same result (0.12), we can conclude that the probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
