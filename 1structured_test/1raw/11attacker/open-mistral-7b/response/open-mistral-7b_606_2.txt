Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black (H), and our evidence is the witness's identification (E). The prior probability P(H) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which we know is 15% (0.15). The likelihood P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which we know is 80% (0.8).

The posterior probability P(H|E) is what we're interested in, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification. We can calculate it using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

To calculate P(E), we need the probability of the witness identifying a black person when the attacker is white. We know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so when the attacker is white, the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|not H) = 0.2.

Using this information, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

This simplifies to:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.42

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 42%.
