Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is estimated as follows:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

The probability that the witness made a correct identification is the product of the city's black population proportion and the witness's correct identification rate:

0.15 (black population proportion) * 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) = 0.12

The probability that the witness made an error is the product of the city's white population proportion and the witness's error rate:

0.85 (white population proportion) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability we are interested in is the probability of the witness's correct identification given that the attacker is black:

P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) = P(attacker is black and witness's correct identification) / P(attacker is black)

P(attacker is black) = 0.15
P(attacker is black and witness's correct identification) = 0.12 (from our computation above)

Therefore,

P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) = 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.8

However, since the witness also made errors, we should consider the possibility that the witness identified a white person as black. The probability that the witness made an error given that the attacker is white is:

P(witness's error | attacker is white) = P(attacker is white and witness's error) / P(attacker is white)

P(attacker is white) = 0.85
P(attacker is white and witness's error) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (from our computation above)

Therefore,

P(witness's error | attacker is white) = 0.17 / 0.85 = 0.2

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / [P(witness's correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness's error | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)]

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = (0.12 * 0.15) / [(0.12 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.238 = 0.504

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.504 or 50.4%.
