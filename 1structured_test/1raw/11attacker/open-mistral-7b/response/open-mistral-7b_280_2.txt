To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Given this information, the probability that the witness misidentified the attacker as black (when the attacker was actually white) is equal to the error rate of 20%. So, the probability that the attacker is actually white and the witness misidentified them as black is 0.85 (probability of being white) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%).

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black (when the attacker was actually black) is equal to the reliability of 80%. So, the probability that the attacker is actually black and the witness correctly identified them is 0.15 (probability of being black) * 0.80 (reliability) = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, since we are interested in the overall probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the correct identification and the misidentification. So, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases: 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (misidentification) = 0.39 (or 39%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.39}.
