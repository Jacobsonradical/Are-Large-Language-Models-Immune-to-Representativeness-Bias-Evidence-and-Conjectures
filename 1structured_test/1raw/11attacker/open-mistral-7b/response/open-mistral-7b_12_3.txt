To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement about the attacker's race.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness said the attacker is black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), is given by the city's demographics: 15% black.

The likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black, P(B|A), is the witness's accuracy rate: 80%.

The likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is white, P(B|~A), is the witness's error rate: 20%.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is white is the same as the likelihood of the witness saying that a white person is black. In a city where 85% of the population is white, this means that the witness saw a white person and misidentified them as black 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

So, P(B|~A) = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimate of:
