Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness who is generally accurate in identifying races (80% correct) identified the attacker as black.

However, we also know that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time. In this case, it's not specified if the witness's mistakes are more likely to occur when identifying white people as black or vice versa. For simplicity's sake, let's assume the error rate is equal for both races (this assumption might affect the final probability estimate, but it won't change the direction of the answer).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
B) The attacker is white, and the witness made an error.

The probability of scenario A is the likelihood of picking a black person from the population and having the witness correctly identify the race. This probability is:

P(A) = Probability of picking a black person * Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person
P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8
P(A) = 0.12

The probability of scenario B is the likelihood of picking a white person from the population and having the witness mistakenly identify the race. This probability is:

P(B) = Probability of picking a white person * Probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black
P(B) = 0.85 * 0.2
P(B) = 0.17

Since there are only two possible scenarios, the total probability should equal 1:

P(A) + P(B) = 1
0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, we found an inconsistency (P(A) + P(B) â‰  1) in the provided information, which may indicate an inaccuracy in the witness's error rate or the population proportions. In such cases, it's essential to check the source of the information or consult additional data to obtain a more reliable estimate.

Given the provided information, the probability of the attacker being black is approximately 12%. However, this estimate should be considered preliminary and potentially unreliable due to the inconsistency in the data.
