Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B. This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A. This is the witness's ability to correctly identify a black person as black, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's identification. This can be calculated from the information given in the city's population. In this case, P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of event B. This is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, regardless of the person's actual race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of a white person being misidentified as black and a black person being correctly identified, which is (0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.17.

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.17] = 0.529

So, based on the witness's identification and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 52.9%.
