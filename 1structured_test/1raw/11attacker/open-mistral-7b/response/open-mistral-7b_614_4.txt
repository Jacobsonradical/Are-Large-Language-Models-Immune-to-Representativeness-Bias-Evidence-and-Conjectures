Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- H: The attacker is black
- ~H: The attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: The witness's identification of the attacker as black

The Bayes' theorem formula is:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Given the information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the population distribution in the city: 0.15
- P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker being white: 0.85
- P(E|H): The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, given by the witness's performance: 0.8
- P(E|~H): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, given by the witness's error rate: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.23

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.23 or 23%. This is significantly lower than the witness's identification, indicating that the witness's identification may not be reliable. However, the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not considered in this analysis.
