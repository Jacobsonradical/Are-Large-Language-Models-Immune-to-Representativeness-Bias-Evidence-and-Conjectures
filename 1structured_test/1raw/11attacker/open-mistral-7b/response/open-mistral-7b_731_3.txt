Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identified attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)
- P(E) is the likelihood of the evidence (this is calculated by summing the probabilities of the evidence given both hypotheses)

First, let's calculate P(E|H):
P(E|H) = probability of witness correctly identifying a black person
P(E|H) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(E|~H), the probability of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis (attacker is white):
P(E|~H) = probability of witness mistaking a white person for black
P(E|~H) = 0.2

Now, let's calculate P(H):
P(H) = 0.15 (as stated in the problem)

Next, let's calculate P(~H):
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
