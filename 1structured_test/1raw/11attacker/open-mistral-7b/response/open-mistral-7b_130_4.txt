Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- A is the event we are interested in (attacker is black)
- B is the evidence (witness's identification)

Let's break down the probabilities:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (0.15) from the population distribution.
2. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are indeed black. This is given as 80% (0.8) from the witness's accuracy.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability:
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   where P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85
   and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are not black. Since we don't have this information, we can assume it's the same as P(B|A) due to lack of specific information. So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.68 = 0.92

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.92
          = 0.12

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
