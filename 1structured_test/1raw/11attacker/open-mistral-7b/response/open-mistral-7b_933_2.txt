Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the attacker's race 80% of the time and erroneously identified it 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's consider the possibilities:
1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (80% chance). In this case, the attacker is indeed black.
2. The witness made an error (20% chance). In this case, the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black.

The witness's error rate (20%) does not affect the actual proportion of black people in the population (15%). Thus, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is equal to the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).

Therefore, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.15}
