Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, given the witness's error, can be calculated as the false positive rate (20% error) divided by the sum of the false positive rate and the true positive rate (100% - 80% correct identification).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black). We're given the following:
- P(Black) = P(Witness correctly identifies Black attacker) + P(Witness incorrectly identifies Black attacker | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)
- Given the witness's error rate, P(Witness incorrectly identifies Black attacker | Attacker is White) = 0.20
- Given the racial demographics, P(Attacker is White) = 0.85

Now, we can solve for P(Black):

P(Black) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
