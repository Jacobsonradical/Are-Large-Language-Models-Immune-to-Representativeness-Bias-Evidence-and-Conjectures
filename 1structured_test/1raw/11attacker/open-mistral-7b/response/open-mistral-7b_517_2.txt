To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, there's a chance that the witness made an error.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness making an error and saying the attacker is white is P(black) * 0.20 (the witness's error rate).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is P(black) * 0.80.

Since the witness said the attacker is black, we can set up an equation based on the probabilities:

P(black) * 0.80 + P(not black) * 0.20 * 0.80 = 0.80 (witness's statement)

We can simplify this equation to:

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.20 * P(not black))

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that P(not black) = 0.85.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.20 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.37 or 37%.
