Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. According to the city's population statistics (information "a"), 15% of the population is black.
2. However, the witness, who was not the victim, identified the attacker as black (information "b"). The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.

Now, let's consider the possible errors:
- If the attacker is actually black (as the witness claimed), the witness correctly identified the race. This happens with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
- If the attacker is actually white, the witness erroneously identified the race as black. This happens with a probability of 0.2 (20%).

Since we don't have any additional information about whether the witness made a correct or incorrect identification in this specific case, we can't modify the probabilities given by the witness's accuracy. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's statement, is 0.8 (80%).

However, it's important to note that this probability is based on the witness's statement and not on the actual attacker's race. The true probability that the attacker is black might be different, and it would require additional evidence to determine.

In summary:
{probability: 0.8, note: This is the probability based on the witness's statement, not the actual probability of the attacker being black.}
