Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(B|A) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4 (given that the sample is half white and half black, and the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(~A) (the probability of the attacker not being black) = 0.85 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.4 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.157 = 0.77

Therefore, given the witness's statement and the demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.77 or 77%.
