Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that deals with conditional probabilities.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person in the city being black)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was actually black)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was actually not black)
4. P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person in the city being white)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
