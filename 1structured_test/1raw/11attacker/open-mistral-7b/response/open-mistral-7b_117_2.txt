To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the likelihood of a random person being black. This is simply the probability of drawing a black person out of the population, which is 15% or 0.15.

However, the witness's identification is not always accurate. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a black person, they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time, and when they see a white person, they incorrectly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black as Q. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation:

P(black) * (1 - Q) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)

We know that Q = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black), so we can solve for P(black):

P(black) = 0.8 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 / 0.8 = 1

However, this result is not possible because the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1. This means that either the witness's accuracy or the demographics of the city are incorrect, or both.

Without more information, it is impossible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black. We need to know the true accuracy of the witness's racial identification or the true demographics of the city. Until then, we must conclude that the information provided is insufficient to make a reliable estimation.

Therefore, the answer in the requested dictionary format is: {probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1, more information is needed}
