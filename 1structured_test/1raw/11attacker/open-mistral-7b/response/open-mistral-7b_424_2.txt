Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's testimony)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy rate when identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's testimony)

Given the information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate when identifying black people)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of black people in the city)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  where ~H is the complement of H (the attacker is not black)
  and P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate when identifying black people)
  and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Calculating P(E) gives:
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.12) / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.67 or 67%. This means that, based on the provided information, it is more likely that the attacker is black than not, but not with absolute certainty.
