Based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (85% white and 15% black). The likelihood of the witness making a mistake is given as 20% (80% correct).

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement (what we want to find)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is black (the witness was correct 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%)
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making the statement (the likelihood of error is 20%, so 1 - 0.8 = 0.2)

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2
        = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
