To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black,
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black,
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black,
- P(E|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person,
- P(E|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person.

We are given P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(~A) = 0.85 (since P(A) + P(~A) = 1 and P(A) = 0.15, given the population statistics).

P(E|~A) is the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is white. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can calculate P(E|~A) as follows:

P(E|~A) = 1 - P(~E|~A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating:

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.1764

So, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 17.64%.
