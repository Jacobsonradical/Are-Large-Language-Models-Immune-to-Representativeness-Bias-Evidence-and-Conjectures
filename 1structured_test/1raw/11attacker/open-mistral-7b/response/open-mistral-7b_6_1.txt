To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black

We are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
P(W|~B) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability)

Since the witness saw the attacker from behind and couldn't identify their race with certainty, the probability that they made an error, regardless of the attacker's race, is equal to the probability of identifying a non-black person as black. Thus, P(W|~B) = 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
1) The attacker is truly black, and the witness correctly identified them.
2) The attacker is not black, and the witness mistakenly identified them as black.

The probability of the first scenario is P(B) * P(W|B) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
The probability of the second scenario is P(~B) * P(W|~B) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in the probability of the first scenario. However, we only have the probability of both scenarios, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

To find the probability of the first scenario given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.46

So, based on the given information and assuming that the witness's racial identification is an independent event, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46. This means there is a 46% chance that the attacker is black.
