Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a rule that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probabilities needed:
1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, given that the person is actually black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given the city's demographics, P(H) = 0.15.
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct (P(E|H)) and being wrong (P(E|~H)), where ~H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is not black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8. And since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2. So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21
          = 0.267

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.267 or 26.7%.
