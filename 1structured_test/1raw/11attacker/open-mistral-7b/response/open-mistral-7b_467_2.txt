Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness to the attack identified the attacker as black with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%. This means that, when presented with a mixed group of white and black people, the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and mistakes it 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can consider this as a "hit" (correct identification) in the context of the witness's accuracy. The probability of this hit happening by chance, given the population distribution, is the proportion of black people in the city.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).

{probability: 0.15}
