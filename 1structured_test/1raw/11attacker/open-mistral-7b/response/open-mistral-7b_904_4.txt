Given the information provided, we have a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we also know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that if we randomly select a person from the population, they are more likely to be white.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the racial makeup of the population. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

Given the witness's accuracy, if the attacker was actually white, the witness would incorrectly identify him as black with probability 0.2 (20% error). On the other hand, if the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify him with probability 0.8 (80% accuracy).

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is therefore 0.2. The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is 0.8.

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. If the attacker is actually white, this is a false positive. If the attacker is black, this is a true positive.

The likelihood ratio (LR) is the ratio of the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true, divided by the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is false. In this case, the LR is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, divided by the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white.

LR = P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is black) / P(witness identifies attacker as black | attacker is white)

= 0.8 / 0.2

= 4

The likelihood ratio tells us how much more likely the evidence is if the hypothesis is true than if the hypothesis is false. In this case, the evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker as black) is four times more likely if the attacker is black than if the attacker is white.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(black | evidence) = LR * P(evidence | black) / (LR * P(evidence | black) + P(evidence | not black))

where P(evidence | black) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, and P(evidence | not black) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (white).

We know P(evidence | black) = 0.8, and P(evidence | not black) = 0.2 (witness's error rate). We also know the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the racial makeup of the population: P(black) = 0.15.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(black | evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

= 0.12 / 0.178

= 0.67

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
