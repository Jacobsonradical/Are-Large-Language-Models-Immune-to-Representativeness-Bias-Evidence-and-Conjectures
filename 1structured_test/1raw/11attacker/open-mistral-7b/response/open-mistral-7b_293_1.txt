Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is stated as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as p.

If the witness saw a white person, we expect them to misclassify it as black 20% of the time. Given that 85% of the population is white, this means the witness will misclassify 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 white people as black.

However, there are actually 15% black people in the city, so the witness would be correct in identifying them 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 times.

Since the witness identifies a person as black, the actual number of black people they identified must be greater than their misclassifications of white people. So, we can set up the inequality: 0.12 > 0.17.

Solving for p, we get p > 0.55 or the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 55%.

However, the witness also correctly identifies black people 80% of the time. Given that 15% of the population is black, this means the witness will correctly identify 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 black people.

Since the witness saw a black person, the actual number of black people they identified must be less than or equal to the total number of people they saw. The total number of people the witness saw is not given, but we can assume it's a large enough sample that the proportion of black people they see should be similar to the city's demographics.

Let's denote the proportion of black people the witness saw as q. Given that 15% of the population is black, we can expect the witness to see a similar proportion of black people in their sample. So, q = 0.15.

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

Given the information in part b, P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 and P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is White) = 0.2.

Using the city's demographic information, P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 and P(Attacker is White) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification) â‰ˆ 0.62 or the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is approximately 62%.

Given both lines of reasoning, the most likely estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 62%.
