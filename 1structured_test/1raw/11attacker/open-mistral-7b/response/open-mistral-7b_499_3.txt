To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker correctly given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly given that the attacker is not black
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker not being black

We are given:
1. P(H) = 0.15 (from "b")
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (from "a")
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from "a")

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

So, P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.226

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.226 or 22.6%.
