To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Here are the probabilities we need for Bayes' theorem:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A), which is the proportion of black people in the city. From the information given, this is 0.15 (15%).

2. The prior probability of the witness identifying a person correctly, given that person's race, P(B|A). Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this is 0.8.

3. The prior probability of the witness identifying a person incorrectly, given that person's race, P(B|not A). Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this is 0.2.

4. The likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is black, P(A|B). Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this is also 0.8.

5. The likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is not black, P(not A|B). Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, this is 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

= 0.12 / 0.29

= 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.414 or 41.4%.
