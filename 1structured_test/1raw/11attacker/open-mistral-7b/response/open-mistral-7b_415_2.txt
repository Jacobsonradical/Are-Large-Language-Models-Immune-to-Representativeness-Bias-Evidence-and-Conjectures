To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is "the attacker is black," and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case, A is "the attacker is black," B is "the witness identified the attacker as black," P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (0.8), P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to find), and P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying a black person as black (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * P(A) / 0.17

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * P(A) / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.47

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.47 or 47%.
