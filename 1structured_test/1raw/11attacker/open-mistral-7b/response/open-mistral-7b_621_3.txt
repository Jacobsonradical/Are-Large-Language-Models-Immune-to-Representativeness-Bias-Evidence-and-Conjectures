To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial demographics of the city.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. The city's racial demographics are 85% white and 15% black.

If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is equal to their error rate of 20%. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is also 20%. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black. This is given by 0.8, or 80%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
