Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city.

The witness's reliability is stated to be 80% for correctly identifying race, and 20% for errors. The racial distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean the attacker is actually black. It's also possible that the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white is 20%, and the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is black is also 20%.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as the ratio of the number of times the witness would correctly identify a black attacker to the total number of times the witness could make such an identification, including both correct and incorrect identifications.

The total number of times the witness could make an identification is the sum of the number of times the attacker is white and the number of times the attacker is black. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the number of times the witness identifies a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the time.

The number of times the witness correctly identifies a black attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%) of the time.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the ratio of correct identifications to total possible identifications: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41 or 41%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both white and black individuals. If the error rate is different, the calculation would need to be adjusted accordingly. Without further information, this assumption cannot be confirmed or refuted.
