The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then the probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is black, given that the attacker is actually white, is 20%.

Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black, is 80%.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can assume that the likelihood of the attacker being white is higher than the likelihood of the attacker being black. Therefore, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness saying the attacker is black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B|A) be the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given that the attacker is black, and P(B) be the probability of the witness saying the attacker is black given any attacker.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness said the attacker is black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A)).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.85 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find that the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness said the attacker is black is approximately 0.275.

Therefore, {probability: 0.275} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
