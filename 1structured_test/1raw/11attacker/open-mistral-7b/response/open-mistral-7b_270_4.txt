Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the attacker's race, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of A and B respectively, and P(B|A) and P(B|A') are the likelihoods of B given A and B given not-A respectively.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, and A' is the attacker being white.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, which we know is 0.8 (80%). P(A') is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A). P(B|A') is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, which we know is 0.2 (20%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|A') * P(A'), or 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)).

From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white, so P(A') = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.12 / 0.3 = 0.4

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4, or 40%.
