Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the witness's statement)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability of the witness's statement before considering the attacker's race)

Since we don't have the exact values for P(B|A) and P(B), we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is independent of the attacker's race. This means that P(B|A) = P(B|not A) = 0.8 for both black and non-black attackers.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(witness states attacker is black) = P(witness states attacker is black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness states attacker is black | attacker is not black) * P(attacker is not black)

Since we don't have the exact values for P(witness states attacker is black | attacker is not black), let's assume that it's the same as P(witness states attacker is black | attacker is black) due to lack of information. This gives us:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15

So, given the information and assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, and the actual probability may be different due to the assumptions made.
