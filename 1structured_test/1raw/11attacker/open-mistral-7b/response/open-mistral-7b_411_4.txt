Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

From the information given, we have:

1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black = Unknown
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black = 0.8 (from the witness's ability)
3. P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black = 0.2 (from the witness's ability)
4. P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying any person as black = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A)

Since the population is half white and half black, P(~A) = 0.5. So,

P(B) = P(A) * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.3P(A) + 0.1

Now we can solve for P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.3P(A) + 0.1)

The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, so we can make an assumption about the prior probability P(A):

P(A) ≈ 0.15 (since 85% of the population is white)

Substituting this value into the equation for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.3 * 0.15 + 0.1) ≈ 0.8 / 0.26 ≈ 0.3077

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.3077 or 30.77%.
