To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's unreliability in identifying race and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the true probability that the attacker is black
- q: the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (1 - 0.8 = 0.2, since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- r: the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (0.8)
- w: the proportion of white people in the city (0.85)

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, there is a chance that the witness made a mistake. We can calculate the probability of this error as follows:

p \* (1 - r) + (1 - p) \* q = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white (error 1) or incorrectly identifies a white person as black (error 2)

The observed probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is w \* (1 - r) + (1 - w) \* r.

We can now set up an equation and solve for p:

w \* (1 - r) + (1 - w) \* r = p \* (1 - r) + (1 - p) \* q

Substituting the given values:

0.85 \* (1 - 0.8) + (1 - 0.85) \* 0.8 = p \* (1 - 0.8) + (1 - p) \* 0.2

0.182 + 0.14 = p \* 0.2 + (1 - p) \* 0.2

Solving for p:

p = 0.182 / 0.2 = 0.91

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can conclude that the witness's unreliability in race identification makes it impossible to make a reliable estimate of the attacker's race based on this information. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black cannot be determined with certainty.
