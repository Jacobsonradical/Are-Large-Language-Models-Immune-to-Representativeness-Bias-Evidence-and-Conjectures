Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability of the attacker being black is given by the distribution of races in the city.

Let's denote P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black. Similarly, let P(B') be the prior probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., being white), and P(W|B') be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is white.

Based on the information provided, we have:

1. P(B) = 0.15 (from the distribution of races in the city)
2. P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
3. P(W|B') = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying race 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|B') * P(B'))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we get:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.26

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.26 or 26%.
