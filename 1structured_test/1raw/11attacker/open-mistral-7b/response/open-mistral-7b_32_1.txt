Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.48, or 48%.
