Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on both the population demographics and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The population demographics suggest that 15% of the city's population is black.
2. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is only 80% accurate, meaning they incorrectly identify race 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy is less than perfect, we need to account for the possibility of an error in their identification. We can do this by considering the probability that the witness made a mistake and identified a white person as black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(white). We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1.

The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with probability P(white) * (1 - 0.8) = P(white) * 0.2, because the witness is only 80% accurate in identifying race.

The witness correctly identifies a black person as black with probability P(black) * 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness making an error and still identifying a black person:

P(black) = P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness mistakes white for black)

P(black) = (P(black) * 0.8) + (P(white) * 0.2)

We know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

P(black) = (P(black) * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)

P(black) - 0.8 * P(black) = 0.17

P(black) = 0.17 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.17 / 0.2 = 0.85

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is approximately 0.85 or 85%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and there may be other factors and uncertainties that could affect the accuracy of this estimate.
