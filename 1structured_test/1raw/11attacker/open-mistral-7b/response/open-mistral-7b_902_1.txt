To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black) given the evidence (the witness's statement). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identified a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. We cannot directly observe this probability, but we can make an informed guess based on the demographics of the city. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the statement given any attacker. Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2, and we can assume that P(E) = P(E|H) + P(E|~H) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 1.0
      = 0.12

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%. This is lower than the 15% proportion of black people in the city, but it takes into account the witness's error rate. It's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and that actual events can deviate from statistics.
