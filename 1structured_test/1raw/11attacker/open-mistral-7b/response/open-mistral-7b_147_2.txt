Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the demographic data of the city and the witness's testimony. Let's analyze both:

1. Demographic data: The city is 85% white and 15% black. This is our prior probability if we assume that the attacker's race is independent of the witness's error.

2. Witness's testimony: The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we know that the witness makes errors 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black (P(black|witness_black)) and the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is white (P(white|witness_black)).

P(black|witness_black) = Probability of witness being correct when attacker is black
                                 = 1 - Probability of witness being incorrect when attacker is black
                                 = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

P(white|witness_black) = Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white attacker as black
                                  = 0.20

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony:

P(black|witness_black) = P(witness_black|black) * P(black) / (P(witness_black|black) * P(black) + P(witness_black|white) * P(white))
                             = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
                             = 0.12

So, based on both the demographic data and the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12.
