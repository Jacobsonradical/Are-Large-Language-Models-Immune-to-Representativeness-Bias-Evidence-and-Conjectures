Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break it down:

1. P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is indeed black. From the information, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so this probability is 0.8.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% in the city's population.

3. P(E): The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the sample of people is half white and half black, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.6.

4. P(H|E): The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.6
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.2333

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.33%.
