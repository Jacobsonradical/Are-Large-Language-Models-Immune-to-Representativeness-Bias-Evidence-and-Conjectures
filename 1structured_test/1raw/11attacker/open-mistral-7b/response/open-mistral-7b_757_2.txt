Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

Here's how we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony. We have this information from the population distribution: P(A) = 0.15 (15%).

P(B|A) is the likelihood, which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. We have this information from the witness's performance: P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(A|B) is our target probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated using the law of total probability and the witness's error rate:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
    = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.1785
    = 0.3

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
        = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.3
        = 0.12 / 0.3
        â‰ˆ 0.4

Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4, or 40%.
