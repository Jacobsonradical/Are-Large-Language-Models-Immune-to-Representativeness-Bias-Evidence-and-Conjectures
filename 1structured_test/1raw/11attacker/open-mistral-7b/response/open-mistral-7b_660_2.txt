To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- E: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(E|A): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given by the witness's performance in similar conditions (0.8)
- P(E|not A): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, given by the complementary probability (1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(not A): the prior probability of the attacker being non-black, which is 1 - P(A)
- P(A|E): the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given that P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(not A) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information). We can solve for P(A|E) by plugging in these values and some simple algebra:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.15)]

Since we want to estimate P(A), we can solve for P(A) by rearranging the equation and solving for P(A):

P(A) = P(A|E) * [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2]

Plugging in P(A|E) = 0.8 (from the witness's performance), we get:

P(A) = 0.8 * (0.15 / 0.2)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.6}
