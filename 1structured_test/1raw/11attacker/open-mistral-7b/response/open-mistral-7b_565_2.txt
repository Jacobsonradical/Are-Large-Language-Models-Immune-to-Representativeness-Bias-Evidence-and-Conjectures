Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the distribution of races in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The first piece of information tells us that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. The second piece of information tells us that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's errors are not specified as to which race they err towards. If we assume that the witness has a bias, either towards identifying people as black or as white, then we would need more information to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Without this information, the best we can do is use the population distribution to make an estimate. The witness's accuracy rate does not change this distribution, so the attacker is likely to be black with a probability of 15%, and white with a probability of 85%.

Therefore, the estimate based solely on the population distribution is: {probability: 0.15}

However, as mentioned earlier, this estimate may be inaccurate if the witness has a bias. If more information is available about the witness's errors, a more accurate estimate can be calculated.
