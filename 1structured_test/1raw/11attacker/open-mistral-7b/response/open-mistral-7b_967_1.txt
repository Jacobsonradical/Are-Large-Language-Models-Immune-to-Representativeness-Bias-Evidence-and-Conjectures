To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the number of white people the witness might mistakenly identify as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the total population.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.80 (since they are correct 80% of the time). There are 15% of the population that is black. So the number of black people that the witness correctly identifies as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%) of the total population.

Since the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, the number of black people that the witness might mistakenly identify as white is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (or 3%) of the total population.

The total population is 100%. So the number of people that the witness correctly identifies as black is 0.12 (or 12%). The number of people that the witness incorrectly identifies as black is 0.03 (or 3%).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black increases the probability that the attacker is black by the number of black people that the witness correctly identifies as black, divided by the total number of people the witness might have identified as black.

So the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.8 (or 80%)

However, since we know that the witness is not always reliable, we should adjust that probability. The witness's statement that the attacker is black has a 80% chance of being correct, but it also has a 20% chance of being incorrect. If the witness is incorrect, then the attacker is actually white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white if the witness is incorrect is 0.85.

So the overall probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68 (or 68%)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68}
