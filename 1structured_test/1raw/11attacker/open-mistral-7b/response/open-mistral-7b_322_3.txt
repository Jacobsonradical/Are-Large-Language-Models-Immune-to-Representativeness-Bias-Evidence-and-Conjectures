Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the hypothesis H is P(H), which is given as 15% or 0.15 in the context of the city's population.

The likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H is P(E|H), which is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 0.8.

The likelihood of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H is P(E|~H), which is the witness's error rate in identifying black people, which is 0.2.

The prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis ~H is P(~H), which is the probability that the attacker is white, which is given as 85% or 0.85 in the context of the city's population.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the hypothesis H, given the evidence E, is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the value:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.17

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.41 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
