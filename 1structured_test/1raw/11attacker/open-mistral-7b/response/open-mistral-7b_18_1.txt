To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental formula in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem is written as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given evidence B. In this case, it's the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence given the event. This is the probability that a black person would be misidentified as white by the witness, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event. This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony.
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness identifying a black person, which is 0.8 based on the witness's performance.

Using this formula, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(A|B) = (1 - 0.2) * P(A) / 0.8

However, we don't have a value for P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being black). Without this information, we can't provide a specific number. But we can say that based on the witness's testimony and the demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is black is likely greater than 15%, the city's black population percentage.

Therefore, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:
{probability: greater than 0.15, but a specific number cannot be provided}
