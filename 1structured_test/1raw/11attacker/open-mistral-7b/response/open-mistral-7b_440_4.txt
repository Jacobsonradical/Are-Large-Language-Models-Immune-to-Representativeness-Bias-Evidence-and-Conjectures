To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of a certain event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the attacker being black),
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the witness identifying someone as black),
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (the updated probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified someone as black),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black).

Let's break it down:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the city population is white and 15% is black, we can estimate P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying someone as black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can estimate P(B) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying a black person).

3. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and given that the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can assume P(B|A) = 0.8 (the prior probability of the witness identifying a black person).

4. Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
   P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.1625

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.1625 or 16.25%.
