Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as black, it could be a correct identification or an error.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (80%). However, we also know that 85% of the population is white. So, if the attacker was white, it would be more likely for the witness to mistakenly identify them as black (given the witness's error rate of 20%).

To account for this, we need to subtract the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black from the total probability of the attacker being black.

The probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%). So, the probability of both events happening (witness mistake and attacker being white) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black minus the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black: 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63 (63%).

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.63.
