Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the general population demographics and the witness's testimony.

1. Based on the demographics of the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This is our prior probability, before considering the witness's testimony.

2. The witness's testimony is that the attacker is black. However, the witness is not infallible and makes errors 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually white, there is a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black.

Since we don't know whether the witness is correct or not, we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is black (as the witness claims) and the attacker is white (despite the witness's claim).

Let's denote:
- P(attacker is black) as B (our goal is to find this probability)
- P(attacker is white) as W

From the demographics, we have:
B + W = 1
B = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)

Given the witness's error rate, if the attacker is white, there is a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify them as black:
P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2

So, the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is white, is:
P(witness says black and attacker is white) = P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white) = 0.2 * W

The probability that the witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is white, is:
P(witness says black and attacker is not black) = P(witness says black | attacker is not black) * P(attacker is not black) = 0.8 * (1 - B) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

The total probability of the witness saying "black" is:
P(witness says black) = P(witness says black and attacker is black) + P(witness says black and attacker is not black) = B + 0.2 * W

Since we have B = 0.15, we can set up an equation:
0.15 + 0.2 * W = 0.8 * W + 0.68

Solving for W, we find that W = 0.6

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is B = 0.15

However, we made an assumption that the witness's error rate is constant. In reality, the error rate might depend on the specific situation, which was dark at night. If the witness has more difficulty distinguishing races in the dark, their error rate might be higher than the 20% given.

In this case, if the witness's error rate is higher, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, would be lower than 0.15. Without more information, it's hard to quantify this effect, but it's important to keep in mind that the 0.15 probability might be an underestimate.

So, {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1} is our best estimate, but it might be too low due to the potential impact of reduced visibility on the witness's ability to distinguish races.
