The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population is 85% white and 15% black. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's reason through this:
1. We know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so there is a 20% chance that they misidentified the attacker's race.
2. If the attacker is white, there is a 85% chance that the witness would identify them as white, given their 80% accuracy rate.
3. We want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (80%). Similarly, let P(W|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20%).

Given the witness's identification, we can set up the following probability chain:

P(A | W) = P(W | A) * P(A) / [P(W | A) * P(A) + P(W | ~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A | W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability:

P(A | W) â‰ˆ 0.229

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 22.9%.
