Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily reliable due to their error rate of 20%.

The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time. So, if we were to assume that the witness's identification is always correct, we would conclude that the attacker is black (15% of the population).

However, we cannot ignore the 20% error rate. Therefore, we need to adjust our estimation based on this error rate.

The witness identified the attacker as black, but there is a 20% chance that they made an error. This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually white, despite the witness's identification.

So, if we subtract the probability of the witness's error from 100%, we get the probability of their correct identification. In this case, it would be 100% - 20% = 80%.

However, we know that the city is 85% white. So, the probability of the attacker being white, even though the witness identified them as black, is the racial demographic proportion. In this case, it would be 85%.

Now, we need to consider both the probability of the witness's correct identification and the probability of the witness's error. The probability of the witness's correct identification is 80%, and the probability of their error is 20%.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification and error rate, is the product of the probability of the witness's correct identification and the racial demographic proportion of blacks. In this case, it would be 0.8 (the probability of the witness's correct identification) times 0.15 (the racial demographic proportion of blacks).

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness's error. The probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's error, is the probability of the witness's error times the racial demographic proportion of whites. In this case, it would be 0.2 (the probability of the witness's error) times 0.85 (the racial demographic proportion of whites).

So, the total probability of the attacker being black or white, given the witness's identification and error rate, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness's correct identification and the probability of the witness's error.

In this case, it would be 0.8 (the probability of the witness's correct identification) times 0.15 (the racial demographic proportion of blacks) plus 0.2 (the probability of the witness's error) times 0.85 (the racial demographic proportion of whites).

Calculating this, we get a total probability of 0.21 or 21%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 21%.
