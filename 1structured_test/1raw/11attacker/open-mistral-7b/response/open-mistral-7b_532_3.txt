Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

Let's denote the hypothesis H as "The attacker is black" and the evidence E as "The witness identified the attacker as black."

According to the given information, we have two probabilities:
1. P(H) = Probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
2. P(E|H) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80%) in the question.
3. P(E|~H) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%) from the question.
4. P(H) = Probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate. From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is white, so P(~H) = Probability of the attacker being not black = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 (15%).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.161 = 0.7458

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.7458 or 74.58%.
