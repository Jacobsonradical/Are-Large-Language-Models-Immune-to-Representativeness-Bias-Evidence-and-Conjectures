To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H represents the hypothesis (attacker is black), E represents the evidence (witness's identification), P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H): The probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is black. From the information given, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the probability before any evidence is considered. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

3. P(E): The probability of the witness's identification, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness identifies correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the attacker could be either black or white, P(E) is the weighted average of these two probabilities:

   P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

   Here, P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that P(E|not H) = 0.20 (20%). P(not H) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85%).

   Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

   0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

   So, P(E) = 0.29

4. Now we can calculate P(H|E):

   P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

   = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29

   = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
