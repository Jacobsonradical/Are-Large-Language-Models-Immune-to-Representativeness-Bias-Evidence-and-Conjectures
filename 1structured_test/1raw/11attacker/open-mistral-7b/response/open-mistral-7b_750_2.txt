Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H) = 0.15, as 15% of the population is black.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H). Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The probability of the evidence, P(E), is the sum of the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being white). P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H).

Given that the witness correctly identifies a white person 50% of the time and errs 50% of the time, P(E|not H) = 0.5. And since 85% of the population is white, P(not H) = 0.85.

So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.545] â‰ˆ 0.214

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 21.4%.
