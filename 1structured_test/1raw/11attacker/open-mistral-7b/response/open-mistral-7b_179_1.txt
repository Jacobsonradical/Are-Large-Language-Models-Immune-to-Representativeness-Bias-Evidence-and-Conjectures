Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the probability of event B given event A and the probability of event B given event not-A (the complement of A).

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We have two pieces of information:
1) Prior probability of A: 15% (from the city's demographic data)
2) Probability of B given A: 100% (the witness is always correct when the attacker is black)
3) Probability of not-A (complement of A): 85% (from the city's demographic data)
4) Probability of B given not-A (erring when the attacker is white): 0.2 (from the witness's performance)

Now, we can calculate the probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32

P(A|B) = 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 46.875%.
