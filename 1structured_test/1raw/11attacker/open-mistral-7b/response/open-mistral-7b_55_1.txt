To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that when the witness identifies a person as black, there's a 20% chance that the person is actually white. Conversely, when the witness identifies a person as white, there's a 80% chance that the person is actually white (since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white is P(black) * (1 - 0.8) = P(black) * 0.2.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black is P(black) * 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the events described above can be expressed as:

0.8 * P(black) = 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.25 or 25%.
