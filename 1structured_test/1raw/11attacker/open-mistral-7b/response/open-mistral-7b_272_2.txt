Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, we also know that the witness's accuracy in identifying races is not perfect. The witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. We cannot be 100% certain that the witness is correct because of the witness's error rate. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black based on this information and the racial composition of the city.

Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence (in this case, the witness's identification). The formula is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

where H is the hypothesis (attacker is black), E is the evidence (witness's identification), P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which we know is 0.8.
2. P(H) = the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the racial composition of the city, 0.15.
3. P(E) = the probability of the witness identifying anyone as black, which is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person as black. Since the witness correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.8, and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(E) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.16

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.16 or 16%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify races is the same in all situations, which may not be the case. In reality, the actual probability could be higher or lower.
