Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate (correctly identifying black people 80% of the time) and 20% inaccurate (mistaking white people for black 20% of the time).

However, the witness made an identification of the attacker as black. If we consider this identification as a true positive (TP) based on the witness's ability, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case,
- Event A is the attacker being black
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black

We are given the probabilities of A and P(B|A), so we need to find P(B) and P(B|A'). Here, A' is the attacker being white.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We are given that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% is black)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% is white)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate for black people)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness's error rate for white people)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.347

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.347 or 34.7%.
