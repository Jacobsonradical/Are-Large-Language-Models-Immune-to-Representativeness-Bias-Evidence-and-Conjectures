To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E (the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that the attacker is black before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability that the witness gives this testimony)

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that 85% of the population is white)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (the probability of the witness giving this testimony, regardless of the attacker's race)

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.241 (approximately 24.1%)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.241}.
