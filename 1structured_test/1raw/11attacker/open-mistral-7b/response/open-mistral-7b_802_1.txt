The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, we cannot be sure that the attacker actually is black, as there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error.

However, we do know that in the population, 85% of the people are white and 15% are black. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, this can be seen as evidence supporting the hypothesis that the attacker is black. But we must also consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). The probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is black is 0.2.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is white is 0 (as the witness always identifies whites as whites, and we cannot tell if the attacker is white from the given information). The probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is white is 1.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the likelihood ratio is the ratio of these two probabilities:

L = P(witness correctly identifies black | attacker is black) / P(witness incorrectly identifies black | attacker is white) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

The likelihood ratio tells us how much more likely it is that the attacker is black given the witness's identification, compared to the attacker being white. However, we need to account for the base rates of black and white people in the population.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is P(black), and the prior probability of the attacker being white is 1 - P(black). The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(black | witness identifies black) = L * P(black) / (L * P(black) + (1 - L) * (1 - P(black)))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(black | witness identifies black) = 0.8 * P(black) / (0.8 * P(black) + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - P(black)))

The witness's identification gives us some evidence that the attacker is black, but we must also consider the base rates of black and white people in the population. From the second piece of information, we know that P(black) = 0.15.

Substituting this value, we get:

P(black | witness identifies black) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)) ≈ 0.24

So, given the witness's identification and the base rates of black and white people in the population, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.24, or 24%. However, this is not definitive evidence, and further investigation would be necessary to reach a conclusive answer.
