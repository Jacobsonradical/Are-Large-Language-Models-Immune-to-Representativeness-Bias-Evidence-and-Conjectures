Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the sum of the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event B given not event A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability of event A (the attacker being black) can be estimated from the population statistics in the city (event B's background rate).

The probability of event B given event A (witness correctly identifies black attacker) is given as 0.8. The probability of event B given not event A (witness incorrectly identifies black attacker as white) can be estimated as the error rate given by the witness, which is 0.2.

The probability of event B (witness identifies attacker as black) given the prior probability of event A is the sum of the probability of event B given event A and the probability of event B given not event A, which is 0.8 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.84.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of event A given event B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since we are interested in the probability of event A (the attacker being black), we can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B|A) * P(not A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%.
