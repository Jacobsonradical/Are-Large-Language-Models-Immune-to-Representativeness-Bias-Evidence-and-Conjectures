Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness identifies races correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's a crucial piece of information missing: how reliable is the witness's identification of the attacker? We only know the witness's accuracy in a controlled environment, not in a nighttime attack scenario. Without this information, it's not possible to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the attacker's race.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on this information. It would require additional information or assumptions about the transferability of the witness's accuracy from a controlled environment to a nighttime attack scenario.
