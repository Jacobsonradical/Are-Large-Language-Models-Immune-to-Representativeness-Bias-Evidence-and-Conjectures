Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is not black (given the witness's statement) is actually 20%, not 80%.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. Since the witness could have made an error, we should consider both the probability that the attacker is black (given the witness's statement) and the probability that the attacker is white.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability that the attacker is white and the witness incorrectly identified them as black is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).

So the total probability that the witness made an error is 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20 (20%).

Since we know that the witness made an error, the probability that the attacker is black is the probability of the error scenario where the attacker is black divided by the total probability of error.

So P(black) = 0.15 * 0.20 / 0.20 = 0.15 (15%)

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 15%.
