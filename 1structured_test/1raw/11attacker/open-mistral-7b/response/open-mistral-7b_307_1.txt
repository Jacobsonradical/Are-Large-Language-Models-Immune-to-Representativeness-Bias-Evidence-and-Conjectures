Given the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The reliability of the witness's racial judgment under similar conditions is given to be 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. There is a chance that the witness made an error in their judgment.

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(black | witnessed black) = P(witnessed black | black) * P(black) / P(witnessed black)

P(witnessed black | black) is the reliability of the witness's judgment, which is 0.8.
P(black) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 0.15 (given in the first piece of information).
P(witnessed black) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of the person's actual race. This can be calculated as the sum of P(witnessed black | black) * P(black) and P(witnessed black | not black) * P(not black).

Since the witness was wrong 20% of the time, P(witnessed black | not black) = 0.2. P(not black) = 1 - P(black) = 0.85.

So, P(witnessed black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28.

Therefore, P(black | witnessed black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.464

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.464 or 46.4%.
