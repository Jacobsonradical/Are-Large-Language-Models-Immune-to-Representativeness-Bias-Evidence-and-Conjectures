To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black),
- E is the evidence (witness statement),
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which is what we want to find,
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness would make such a statement if the attacker is black),
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering any evidence), and
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis).

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time when the attacker is black)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) (where P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the attacker is not black, which we don't have directly, but we can compute it as 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2)

So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
