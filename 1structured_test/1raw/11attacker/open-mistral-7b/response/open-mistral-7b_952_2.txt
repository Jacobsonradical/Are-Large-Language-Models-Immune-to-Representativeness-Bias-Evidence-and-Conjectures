Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The racial composition of the city: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races: the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make here. The witness's error rate of 20% is calculated based on a scenario where the witness has equal exposure to both white and black individuals. In the real world scenario, the witness likely has more exposure to white individuals due to the city's demographics. This could potentially skew the witness's ability to correctly identify black individuals.

But let's assume for the sake of argument that the witness's accuracy is unaffected by the city's demographics and that they would still correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time, regardless of the racial composition of the city.

In this case, the witness's identification of the attacker as black would mean they were correct 80% of the time, given their error rate. However, we don't know if this 80% accuracy rate is higher or lower than the 15% actual proportion of black individuals in the city. Without further information, it's impossible to estimate the probability that the attacker is black with a specific number.

Therefore, my answer is: {probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
