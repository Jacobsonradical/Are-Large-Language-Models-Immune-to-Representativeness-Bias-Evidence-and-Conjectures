To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black

We know that P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(W|~B) = 0.2, and the total probability of the witness making a correct identification is P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B).

Given that half of the population is black, P(B) = 0.5. So, we have:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can rewrite the equation for P(B) in terms of P(W):

P(B) = P(B) * P(W|B) / P(W)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(B) = P(B) * (0.8) / 0.6 = (2 * P(B)) / 3

Solving for P(B), we find:

P(B) = 1 / 2 = 0.5

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.5, or 50%.
