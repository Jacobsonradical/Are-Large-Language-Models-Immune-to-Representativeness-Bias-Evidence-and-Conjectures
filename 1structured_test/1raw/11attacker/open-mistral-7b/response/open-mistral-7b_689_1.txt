Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

According to the first piece of information, the prior probability of H is P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

According to the second piece of information, the probability of observing E given that H is true is P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).

Similarly, the probability of observing E given that H is false is P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating the numbers, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:
