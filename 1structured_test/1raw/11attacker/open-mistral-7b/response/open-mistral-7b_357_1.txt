Given the information provided, we have two sources of probabilities: the city's population distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

1. The city's population distribution: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: 80% accuracy, which means an error rate of 20%.

However, it's important to note that the witness's accuracy is calculated in a controlled environment (a sample of people half white and half black), not in the actual night scenario where the attack occurred. We don't have enough information to adjust for potential biases or errors in this specific situation.

Therefore, while we can provide the probability based on the city's population distribution, we cannot reliably adjust it to account for the witness's accuracy in this case.

{probability: 0.15, this is the proportion of the city's population that is black}
