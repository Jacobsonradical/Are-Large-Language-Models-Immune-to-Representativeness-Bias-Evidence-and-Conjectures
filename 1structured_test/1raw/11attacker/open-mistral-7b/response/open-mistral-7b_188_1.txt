To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would make the statement given that the attacker is black. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement.

Let's break this down:

1. P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement. This is what we're trying to find.

2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would make the statement given that the attacker is black. The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. We know that 15% of the population is black, so P(H) = 0.15.

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement. Since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, and there are equal numbers of whites and blacks, we can assume that each time the witness makes a statement, there's a 0.5 chance it's about a white person and a 0.5 chance it's about a black person. So, the probability of the witness's statement is P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.12]
       = 0.12 / 0.12
       = 1

However, the probability must be between 0 and 1. This result means that, given the witness's statement, it's not possible to calculate an exact probability for the attacker being black. This could be due to the fact that we've made several simplifying assumptions, such assuming that the witness's ability to identify race is the same in the dark as in daylight.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format. However, based on the given information, it seems that the witness's statement is not reliable enough to make a strong estimate about the attacker's race.
