To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, the city has a 15% black population. So, if the attacker is indeed black, there's no need to consider the witness's error rate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated as the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and the witness being correct (0.15) and the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker still being black (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).
