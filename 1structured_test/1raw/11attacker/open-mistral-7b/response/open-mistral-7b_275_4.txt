Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability: They correctly identify race 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the likelihood that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Black Attacker | Witness's Statement) = [P(Witness's Statement | Black Attacker) * P(Black Attacker)] / [P(Witness's Statement)]

First, we need to calculate P(Witness's Statement | Black Attacker) and P(Witness's Statement | White Attacker).

P(Witness's Statement | Black Attacker) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
P(Witness's Statement | White Attacker) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies black people as white 20% of the time)

Next, we need to calculate P(Black Attacker) and P(White Attacker). Since there are twice as many white people as black people in the city, P(White Attacker) = 0.85, and P(Black Attacker) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(Witness's Statement):

P(Witness's Statement) = P(Witness's Statement | Black Attacker) * P(Black Attacker) + P(Witness's Statement | White Attacker) * P(White Attacker)
P(Witness's Statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(Black Attacker | Witness's Statement):

P(Black Attacker | Witness's Statement) = [P(Witness's Statement | Black Attacker) * P(Black Attacker)] / [P(Witness's Statement)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
