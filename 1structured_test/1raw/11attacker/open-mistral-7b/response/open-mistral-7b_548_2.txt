Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographic distribution.

1. The city's demographic distribution is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
3. However, we don't know if the witness made an error in this case or if the witness was actually correct.
4. To make an estimate, we can assume an equal likelihood of error for each race (since we don't have additional information).
5. Therefore, we can assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black has a 20% chance of being an error, and the witness's original observation of the attacker being black has an 80% chance of being correct.
6. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness observing a white attacker and making an error is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, or 17%.
7. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is the probability of the witness being correct plus the probability of the witness making an error and observing a black attacker, which is 0.80 + 0.15 = 0.95, or 95%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on certain assumptions and may not reflect the true probability in this specific case. A more accurate estimate would require additional information or evidence.
