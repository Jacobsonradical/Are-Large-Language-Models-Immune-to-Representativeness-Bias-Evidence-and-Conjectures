To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to find)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (white)
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification of the attacker as black
- P(~A|B) as the probability of the attacker being not black (white) given the witness's identification of the attacker as black

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black), P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time). We also know that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Substituting the values, we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12 * 0.125 = 0.015625

Converting this probability to a percentage, we get:

{probability: 1.5625%, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
