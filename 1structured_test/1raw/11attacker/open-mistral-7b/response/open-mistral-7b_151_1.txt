Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is:

{
  "probability": 0.8
}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The population composition is given as 85% white and 15% black.
2. However, we have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual population distribution, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 20%.
4. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85.
5. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.
6. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the attacker must be one of the 15% black population or one of the 17% falsely identified white population.
7. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being black is the sum of the actual black population and the falsely identified white population: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32 or 32%.
8. However, given the information that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual population distribution, it is more reasonable to assume that the witness's ability to identify race is consistent across all races.
9. In this case, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white should be the same as the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20%).
10. Therefore, the actual black population of 15% is a more reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker is black.

In conclusion, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is 15%.
