This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as "the attacker is black" and event B as "the witness identifies the attacker as black."

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of A, P(A), is 0.15 (85% white means 15% black).
2. The conditional probability of B given A, P(B|A), is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time).
3. The conditional probability of B given not-A, P(B|not-A), is 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the race 20% of the time).

To find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.
