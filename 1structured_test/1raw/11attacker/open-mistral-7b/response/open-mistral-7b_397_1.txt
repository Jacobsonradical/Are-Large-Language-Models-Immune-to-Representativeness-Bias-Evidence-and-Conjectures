Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the attacker being black, and E is the witness's statement.

1. We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time) and P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, where ~H means not black).

2. We are also given the prior probability P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

3. The probability of the evidence P(E) is the sum of the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.315

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.315 or 31.5%.
