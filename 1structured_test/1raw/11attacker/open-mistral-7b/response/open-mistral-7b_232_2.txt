Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's population breakdown is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's reason through this:

If the witness's statement about the attacker's race is true, the attacker must be black. However, we know that the witness is not always 100% accurate. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, there's a chance that the witness could have mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

On the other hand, if the witness is incorrect, then the attacker must be white, given the city's population statistics.

To find the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both scenarios:

a) If the witness's statement is true, the attacker is black with a probability of 1 (since we're assuming the statement is correct for this calculation).

b) If the witness's statement is false, the attacker is white with a probability of 0.85 (given the city's population statistics).

The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability that the witness is wrong is 0.20.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is:

P(attacker is black | witness statement) = P(witness statement is true) * P(attacker is black | witness statement is true) + P(witness statement is false) * P(attacker is black | witness statement is false)

P(witness statement is true) = 1 - P(witness statement is false) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

P(attacker is black | witness statement is true) = 1
P(attacker is black | witness statement is false) = 0

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

0.80 * 1 + 0.20 * 0 = 0.80

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the city's population statistics, is approximately 0.80 or 80%.
