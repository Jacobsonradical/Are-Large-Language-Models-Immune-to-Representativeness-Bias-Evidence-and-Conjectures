Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important detail missing: we don't know whether the witness's errors are more likely to occur when identifying black individuals as white or white individuals as black. Without this information, we can't fully quantify the reliability of the witness's testimony.

As a result, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate. The best I can suggest is to consider both the city's racial demographics and the witness's accuracy rate, but with caution due to the missing information about the witness's error patterns.
