To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (we don't have this information, but we can guess based on the city's demographics given in point b)
- P(B|W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) is the likelihood of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is black (given in point a)
- P(W|~B) is the likelihood of the witness making the observation given that the attacker is not black (we don't have this information, but we can assume it's the complement of P(W|B), i.e., 1 - P(W|B))
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (since P(B) + P(~B) = 1, we can express P(~B) as 1 - P(B))

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

We have the values for P(W|B) and P(B) (we can approximate P(B) based on point b), but we don't have the values for P(W|~B) and P(~B). However, we can approximate P(W|~B) as 1 - P(W|B) (since the witness is wrong in identifying the attacker's race 20% of the time when the attacker is black).

We can now calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]
      = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + (1 - P(W|B)) * (1 - P(B))]

Now let's assume P(B) = 0.15 (since 85% of the city's population is white, we can assume that the attacker is white with a probability of 0.85, and black with a probability of 0.15). We can now calculate P(W|B):

P(W|B) = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + (1 - P(W|B)) * (1 - P(B))]
      = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)]
      = 0.12

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%). This estimate is quite different from the witness's estimate of 80%, which might suggest that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is not as reliable as assumed in the given information.
