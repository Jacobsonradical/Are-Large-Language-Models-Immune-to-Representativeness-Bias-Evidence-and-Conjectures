Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The breakdown of race in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A represents the attacker being black, and B represents the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given the witness's accuracy of 80%, this is 0.8.
2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is black, which is a combination of the probability that the attacker is black (P(A)) and the probability that the attacker is white (P(not A)) multiplied by the corresponding probabilities of the witness making the correct identification and error, respectively:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))
= 0.8P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Solving this equation gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.32

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
