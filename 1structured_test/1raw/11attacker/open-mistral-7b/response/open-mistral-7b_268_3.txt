Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial distribution of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

The racial distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the information from the victim. Since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we can assume that their description of the attacker is not influenced by race. Therefore, the witness's identification should not be given much weight in this case.

Given this, we should rely on the racial distribution of the city to make an estimate. The probability that the attacker is black is 15% (as per the city's demographics).
