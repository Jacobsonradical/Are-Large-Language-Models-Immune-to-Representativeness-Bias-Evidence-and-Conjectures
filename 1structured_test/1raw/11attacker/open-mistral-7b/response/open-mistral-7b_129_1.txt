Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the hypothesis H is given by the population statistics: P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).

The likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H is the accuracy of the witness when identifying blacks, which we know is 0.8. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H (denoted as ¬H) is the accuracy of the witness when identifying whites, which we know is 0.5 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time). So, P(E|¬H) = 0.5.

The prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis ¬H is the probability that the attacker is white, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.34.

Therefore, {probability: 0.34}
