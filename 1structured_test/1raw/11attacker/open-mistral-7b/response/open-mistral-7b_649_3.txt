Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The attacker is actually black (true positive).
   b) The witness made an error and the attacker is white (false positive).
3. The probability of the witness making a false positive is 20% (from information b).
4. The probability of the actual attacker being black is the probability of a true positive plus the probability of a false positive, divided by the total probability.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is (probability of true positive) + (probability of false positive) * (probability of the attacker being white).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

The probability of a false positive is 0.20.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black:
(0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.32}
