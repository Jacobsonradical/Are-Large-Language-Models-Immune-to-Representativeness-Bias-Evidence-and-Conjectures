To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the overall racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error in this case was incorrectly identifying a black person as white or vice versa, we'll assume an equal error rate of 10% for each type of mistake.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the actual probability of a random person being white is 0.85. The witness, however, will incorrectly identify a white person as black 10% of the time, so the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.10 = 0.085 or 8.5%.

Since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, the probability that a black person is correctly identified as such is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 10% of the time, so the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a black person as white is 0.15 * 0.10 = 0.015 or 1.5%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are three possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black and was correctly identified (probability of 0.12).
2. The attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black (probability of 0.085).
3. The attacker is actually black, but the witness mistakenly identified him as white (probability of 0.015).

The sum of these probabilities should equal 1, but we made an assumption about the error rates that might not be accurate. To account for this, we can calculate an adjusted probability:

Adjusted probability of attacker being black = (probability of correct identification) + (probability of mistaken white identification) - (probability of mistaken black identification)

Adjusted probability of attacker being black = 0.12 + 0.085 - 0.015
                                                                = 0.215 or 21.5%

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rates are the same for both black and white individuals, which is not necessarily the case. The actual probability could be lower or higher depending on the true error rates.
