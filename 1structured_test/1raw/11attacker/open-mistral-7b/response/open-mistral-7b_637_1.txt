Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our variables:

- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

From the information given, we have two pieces of prior knowledge:

1. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black in the city's population. This is given as 15% (0.15) in the second piece of information.
2. P(E|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given as 80% (0.8) in the first piece of information.

We also have the probability of the witness making a mistake when identifying a black person as white, which is 20% (0.2). This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Where ~H represents the attacker is not black, and P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, which is given as 0 (since it's impossible given the information).

So, the equation simplifies to:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H)

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city's population.
