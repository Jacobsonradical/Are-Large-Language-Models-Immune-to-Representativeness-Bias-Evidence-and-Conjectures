To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to calculate the probability of an event given some evidence and background knowledge. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is black
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (before we have any evidence)
- P(E|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black
- P(E|~A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from part b)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(E|A) = 0.8 (from part a)
- P(E|~A) = 0.2 (from part a)

Now we can calculate P(A|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A))

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.12 (or 12%) based on the witness's identification. However, it's important to note that this is just a probability estimate and does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black with this certainty. Other evidence or factors may change this probability.
