To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person (also given in the second piece of information)
- P(B|W) as the probability we're interested in, which is the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification

We can write Bayes' theorem as:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Now, we can substitute the given values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 22%.
