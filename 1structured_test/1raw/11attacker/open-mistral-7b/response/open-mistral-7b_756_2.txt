To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following information:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (the population of black people in the city is 15%)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   - P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black (1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
   - P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (since 0.15 is the proportion of black people, 0.85 is the proportion of non-black people)

To find P(E|not H), we can use the statement that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. This means that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so P(E|not H) = 20%.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.31

So our estimate, based on the given information, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.31 or 31%.
