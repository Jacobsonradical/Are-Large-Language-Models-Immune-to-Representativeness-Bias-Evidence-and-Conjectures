To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is either black (B) or white (W). We can represent the probability of the witness making a correct identification as P(B|B) for a black attacker and P(W|W) for a white attacker. Similarly, we can represent the probability of the witness making an error as P(B|W) for a white attacker misidentified as black and P(W|B) for a black attacker misidentified as white.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as black, we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually black. This can be represented as P(B|observed black).

We know that the total probability of making a correct identification and an error should sum to 1:

P(B|B) + P(W|B) = 1 (1)

We also know that the probability of making a correct identification and an error for a black attacker should be equal to the witness's overall accuracy of 0.8:

P(B|B) * P(B) + P(W|B) * P(W) = 0.8 (2)

We can substitute the values for the racial composition of the city from information "b":

P(B) = 0.15, P(W) = 0.85 (3)

Now we can solve equations (1) and (2) to find P(B|B) and P(W|B):

P(B|B) = 0.8 / (0.15 + 0.8 * P(W|B)) (4)
P(W|B) = (1 - P(B|B)) * P(B) / P(W) (5)

Using equations (3), (4), and (5) to solve for P(W|B), we get:

P(W|B) = (1 - 0.8) * 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.14

Now we can substitute P(W|B) into equation (4) to find P(B|B):

P(B|B) = 0.8 / (0.15 + 0.8 * 0.14) ≈ 0.75

Finally, we can find P(B|observed black) by multiplying P(B|B) by the probability of observing a black attacker (given by the racial composition of the city):

P(B|observed black) = P(B|B) * P(B) = 0.75 * 0.15 ≈ 0.11

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.11 or 11%.
