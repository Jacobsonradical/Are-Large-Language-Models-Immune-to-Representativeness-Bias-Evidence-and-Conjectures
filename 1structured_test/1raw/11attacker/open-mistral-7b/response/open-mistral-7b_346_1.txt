To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. This represents the "false positive" probability.

The probability of a false positive is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white times the probability of the attacker being black.

P(false positive) = P(witness incorrectly identifies black as white) * P(attacker is black)
                          = 0.20 * 0.15
                          = 0.03

Since the witness also identifies the attacker as black, we can find the probability of the attacker being black by subtracting the probability of a false positive from the probability that the witness identified the attacker correctly as black.

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black as black) - P(false positive)
                              = 0.80 - 0.03
                              = 0.77

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.77, or 77%.
