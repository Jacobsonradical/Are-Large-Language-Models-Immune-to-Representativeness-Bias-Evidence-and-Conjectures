To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city.

The witness errs 20% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify a person as black when they are actually white. Since 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring when identifying a white person as follows:

Probability of error given white person = Witness error rate * Percentage of white people
                                                            = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                            = 0.17

This means that in 17% of cases, the witness will incorrectly identify a white person as black.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the attacker is black. If the attacker is indeed black, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is therefore:

Probability of correct identification given black attacker = Witness accuracy * Percentage of black people
                                                                                     = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                                                     = 0.12

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness is making an error when they identify the attacker as black. The probability of this happening is the product of the witness's error rate and the percentage of white people:

Probability of error given black attacker = Witness error rate * Percentage of white people
                                                            = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                            = 0.17

So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, either correctly or erroneously, is the sum of these two probabilities:

Total probability of identifying attacker as black = Probability of correct identification + Probability of error
                                                                              = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                                              = 0.29

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.29}
