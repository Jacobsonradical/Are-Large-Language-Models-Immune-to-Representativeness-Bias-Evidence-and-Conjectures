To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial makeup of the city's population.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. We can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is black using the witness's accuracy rate:

P(correct identification | attacker is black) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate)

We can also calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is white using the complement of the witness's accuracy rate:

P(correct identification | attacker is white) = 1 - 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.8

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is in the city's population:

P(correct identification) = P(correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(correct identification | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

P(correct identification) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.8) * (0.85)

P(correct identification) ≈ 0.73

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness's identification was correct:

P(attacker is black | correct identification) = P(correct identification | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(correct identification)

P(attacker is black | correct identification) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.73

P(attacker is black | correct identification) ≈ 0.205

Therefore, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 20.5%.
