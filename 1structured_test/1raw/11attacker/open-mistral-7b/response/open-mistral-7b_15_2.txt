Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of prior information:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 85% or 0.85

We are also given information about the witness's reliability:
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is 0.8
- P(E|~H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which is 0.2

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.25, or 25%, that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

However, we should note that the witness's identification might not be reliable. If the witness often makes errors in judging race, their identification should be given less weight in our estimation. The court's assessment of the witness's reliability suggests that their errors occur 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify race 80% of the time. This suggests that the witness is generally reliable, but their identification of the attacker as black should be treated as less certain than the prior probability of 15%.

Therefore, while the witness's identification gives some evidence that the attacker is black, it is not strong enough evidence to override the prior probability of 15%. Therefore, a more conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be to stick with the prior probability of 15%.

In summary, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 (15%), but this estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the potential unreliability of the witness's identification.
