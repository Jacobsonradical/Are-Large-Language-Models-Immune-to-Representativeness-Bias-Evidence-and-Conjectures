Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that provides a way of updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let:
- A be the event that the attacker is black
- B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:
1. P(A) = 15% (from information b)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's ability to identify black people, given in the first piece of information)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness's ability to identify non-black people, assumed to be the same as their ability to identify black people, given in the first piece of information) where ~A represents the event that the attacker is not black

Now, we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, given the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34.48%.
