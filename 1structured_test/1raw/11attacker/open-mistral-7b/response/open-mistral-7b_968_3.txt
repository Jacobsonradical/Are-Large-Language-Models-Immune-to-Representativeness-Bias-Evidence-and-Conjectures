Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker, we can assume that the witness's incorrect identifications are equally distributed between the two races (white and black).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the witness would be more likely to mistake a white person for a black person than the other way around, due to the higher population of whites.

So, let's calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white:

1. The witness identifies a black person as white 20% of the time.
2. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85.
3. Since we assume that the witness's incorrect identifications are equally distributed, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person:
1. The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time.
2. Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.
3. Since we assume that the witness's correct identifications are equally distributed, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%)

Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker, the only reasonable estimate is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.12 (or 12%). However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on some assumptions and may not be accurate in real-world scenarios.
