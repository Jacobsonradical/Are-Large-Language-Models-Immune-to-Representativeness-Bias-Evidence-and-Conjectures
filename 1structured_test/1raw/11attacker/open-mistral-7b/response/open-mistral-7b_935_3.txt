To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's find the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)). In this case, the evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is black. We know that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (80%).

Next, we need to find the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)). This is the probability of the attacker being black before considering any evidence. We are given that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. So, P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the evidence (P(E)) is the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness's accuracy is 80% for black people and 20% for white people, we can calculate the overall probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black as follows:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 (34%).
