To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identified the race.
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:

1. Probability of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying the race: 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) * 0.8 (witness's success rate) = 0.12
2. Probability of the attacker being white and the witness mistakenly identifying the race: 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the witness's testimony being correct, which is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

0.12 (first scenario) + 0.17 (second scenario) = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
