Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this witness's performance applies to the specific attacker.

We do know that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the actual race of the person, then we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We know P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black) is 0.8 (80%).

We know P(A) (the probability of the attacker being black) is 0.15 (15%).

We can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, by multiplying P(B|A) and P(A) by the probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(A)) and then adding that to the result of multiplying P(B|A) and P(A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A) * (1 - P(A))
    = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.68
    = 0.8

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
        â‰ˆ 0.15

So, given the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.15 or 15%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified interpretation of the situation and may not fully account for all the complexities involved.
