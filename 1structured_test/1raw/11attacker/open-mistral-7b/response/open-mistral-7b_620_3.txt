Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so we cannot rely on the witness's identification.

The population statistics suggest that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. This is the true probability of an attacker being black in the city.

Since the witness's identification is not reliable in this case, we should use the city's population statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, {probability: 0.15} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
