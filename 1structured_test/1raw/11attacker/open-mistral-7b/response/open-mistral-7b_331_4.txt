To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following information:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified race 80% of the time when the person was black)
2. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified race 20% of the time when the person was white)
3. P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black)

To find P(~H), we can use the fact that P(H) + P(~H) = 1:
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.341

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.341 or 34.1%.
