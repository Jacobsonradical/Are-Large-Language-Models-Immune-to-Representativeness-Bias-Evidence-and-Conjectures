Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(H)), which is 15% or 0.15. We are also given the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black given that the person is black (P(E | H)), which is 0.8 (80%).

The witness incorrectly identified a black person as white 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as black given that the person is white (P(E | not H)) is 0.2.

Since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black given that the person is white (P(not E | H)) is also 0.2.

However, we are not given the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white (P(E | not H)) or the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (P(not E | not H)). Without these probabilities, we cannot calculate P(E).

Therefore, we cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format. To provide an estimate, we would need more information.

However, we can make an approximated guess based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race is symmetrical, meaning the probability of incorrectly identifying a black person as white is the same as the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black. This would mean P(E | not H) = 0.2 and P(not E | not H) = 0.8.

Under this assumption, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification would be approximately 0.67.

Therefore, {probability: 0.67, please provide a number between 0 and 1} is an approximated estimate. However, this estimate is based on an assumption and may not accurately reflect the true probability.
