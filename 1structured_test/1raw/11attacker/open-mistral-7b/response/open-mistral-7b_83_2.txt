To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, with an error rate of 20%. However, since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case (identifying the attacker as black), we should consider both scenarios: the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified the race, and the attacker is not black and the witness mistakenly identified the race.

1. If the attacker is black: The probability of this event is 15% (since 15% of the city's population is black). Given the witness's accuracy, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is 0.8 (or 80%).

2. If the attacker is not black: The probability of this event is 85% (since 85% of the city's population is white). Given the witness's error rate, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since we don't know which scenario is true, we should consider both and find the weighted average of their probabilities.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's report, is:

(Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying race) + (Probability of attacker not being black * Probability of witness mistakenly identifying race)
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's report and the racial composition of the city, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
