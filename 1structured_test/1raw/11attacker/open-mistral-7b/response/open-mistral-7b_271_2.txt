To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the city's demographic information and the witness's reliability.

Let's denote:
- P(white) as the probability that a random person in the city is white, which is given as 0.85.
- P(black) as the probability that a random person in the city is black, which is given as 0.15.
- P(witness_correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's race.
- P(witness_err_black) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black.
- P(witness_err_white) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a black person as white.

We know that P(witness_correct) = 0.8 and P(witness_err_black) + P(witness_err_white) = 0.2.

Since the witness always errs in identifying white people as black (P(witness_err_white) = 0), we can find P(witness_err_black):

P(witness_err_black) = 0.2 - P(witness_err_white) = 0.2

Now, we need to find the probability that the witness identified the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This can be calculated as:

P(witness_correct | attacker_is_black) = P(witness_correct and attacker_is_black) / P(attacker_is_black)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(witness_correct and attacker_is_black) = P(attacker_is_black | witness_correct) * P(witness_correct)

Since the witness never errs in identifying black people as black (P(attacker_is_black | witness_correct) = 1), we can write:

P(witness_correct and attacker_is_black) = P(witness_correct)

Now, we can calculate P(witness_correct | attacker_is_black):

P(witness_correct | attacker_is_black) = P(witness_correct) / P(attacker_is_black)

Since we know P(witness_correct) = 0.8, we can write:

P(witness_correct | attacker_is_black) = 0.8 / 0.15 = 0.5333

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black:
