Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, our prior belief (before the witness's testimony) is that the attacker is either white or black, and we know the proportion of each race in the city. The likelihood of the witness's testimony (given that the attacker is white or black) can be calculated based on the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is black (15% as given in the question)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black (given as 80% in the question)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is not black (given as 20% in the question)
- P(~A) as the prior probability that the attacker is white (1 - P(A) = 85%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.212

So, based on the given information and assuming the witness's testimony is accurate, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 21.2%.
