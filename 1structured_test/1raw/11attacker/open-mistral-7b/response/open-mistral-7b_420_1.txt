Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black should be considered as one of the witness's incorrect identifications (20% of the time), since the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's statement, is the same as the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black (the error rate).

However, this assumption might not be entirely accurate, as the witness's error rate might not be the same for identifying black people as white people. If the witness has a greater tendency to mistake whites for blacks than the other way around, then the witness's statement might be more likely to be correct.

Without more specific information about the witness's biases or errors in each direction, it's impossible to provide a precise probability. Therefore, I'll give a probability estimate based on the information provided, which is that the attacker is black with a probability of 0.2 (20%).
