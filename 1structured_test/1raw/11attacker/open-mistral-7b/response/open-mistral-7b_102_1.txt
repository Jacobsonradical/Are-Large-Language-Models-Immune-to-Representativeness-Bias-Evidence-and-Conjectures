Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not infallible identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually white, they will mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Since we do not know the race of the attacker, let's denote the true race of the attacker as W for white and B for black. The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be seen as evidence that the attacker is actually black or that the witness made an error in their identification.

Let's denote the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually white as e_white. Given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, we can write the equation:

0.8 = 0.15 * P(B) + 0.85 * (1 - e_white)

where P(B) is the probability that the attacker is black.

Similarly, let's denote the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually black as e_black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, we can write the equation:

0.2 = 0.15 * e_black + 0.85 * (1 - P(B))

Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, P(B) and e_black. Solving this system of equations is a complex task that would require more information or a mathematical model of the error rates.

However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the error rates are equal for both races, that is, e_white = e_black = e. Under this assumption, we can simplify the first equation to:

0.8 = 0.15 * P(B) + 0.85 * (1 - e)

and the second equation to:

0.2 = 0.15 * e + 0.85 * (1 - P(B))

Solving this simplified system of equations, we get an estimate of P(B) = 0.76, or approximately 76%. However, it's important to note that this is an approximation based on the assumption of equal error rates, and the true probability may be different.
