Given the two pieces of information, we have a population distribution of 85% white and 15% black, and a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the population distribution.

The witness's identification could be correct, but since we cannot rule out the possibility of an error, we should consider both scenarios: the attacker is indeed black, and the witness is incorrect.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We know that the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is white is 20%. So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness is incorrect is 0.17. The probability of the attacker being black and the witness being correct is 0.15 - 0.17 = -0.02 (which is not a valid probability). This negative probability indicates that the scenario is not possible.

Therefore, since the scenario where the attacker is white and the witness is incorrect is not possible, the only remaining scenario is that the attacker is black and the witness is correct. The probability of this scenario is 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black).

However, as mentioned earlier, the witness's identification could be incorrect, and we cannot rule out the possibility of an error. Therefore, we should consider the probability of the witness being incorrect, which is 0.2.

In conclusion, the best estimate we can give is a weighted average of the probabilities of the two scenarios: the attacker is black and the witness is correct (0.15), and the attacker is white and the witness is incorrect (0.17 * 0.2 = 0.034, or 3.4%). The weighted average is (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.034 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.0068 = 0.1268 (12.7%).

However, this estimate is not based on sound reasoning, as the witness's identification could be incorrect. A more proper analysis would require more information, such as the specific conditions under which the witness made the identification.
