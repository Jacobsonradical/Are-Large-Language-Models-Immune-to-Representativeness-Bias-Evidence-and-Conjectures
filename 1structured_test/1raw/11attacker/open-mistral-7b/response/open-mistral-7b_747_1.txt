Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- H: the attacker is black
- ~H: the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black is P(H) = 0.15 (from the population statistics). The likelihood of the witness identifying a black person as black is P(E|H) = 0.8 (given in the information). The likelihood of the witness identifying a white person as black is P(E|~H) = 0.2 (given in the information).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.18 or 18%. This is lower than the actual population proportion of black individuals, which suggests that the witness may have erred in this particular case. However, without more information, it is impossible to say for certain.
