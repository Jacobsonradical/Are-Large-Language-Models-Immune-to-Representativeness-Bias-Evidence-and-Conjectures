Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black). However, we are not given P(B|~A), the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the race when the person was white.

To estimate P(B|~A), we can use the information that the witness was wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, and since 85% of the population is white, we can assume that the majority of the times when the witness was wrong, it was because they mistook a white person for a black one. Therefore, we can approximate P(B|~A) as 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.221.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.221 â‰ˆ 0.362

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.362 or 36.2%.
