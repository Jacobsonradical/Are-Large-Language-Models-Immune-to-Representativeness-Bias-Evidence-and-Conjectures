To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can assume that the witness's error rate applies to their identification of the attacker as well.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of times the witness would correctly identify a black attacker, which is the witness's success rate (0.8) times the proportion of black people in the city (0.15).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
