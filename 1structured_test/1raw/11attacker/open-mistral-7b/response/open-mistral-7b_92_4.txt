To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker is actually white, the witness will misidentify them as black 20% of the time. Conversely, if the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white, there is a higher probability that the attacker is white. However, we need to account for the witness's errors.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 (20%). Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness seeing a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness misidentifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of the attacker being black and correctly identified by the witness is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness misidentifying a black person as white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, the probability of the attacker being black and misidentified is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

Adding the probabilities of the correct and incorrect identifications, we get a total probability of 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (15%) that the attacker is black.
