Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black. Since we cannot determine if the witness's error was in this case or if they correctly identified the attacker, we cannot directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the attacker's race.

Therefore, based on the population statistics provided, the attacker is most likely white, as 85% of the city's population is white. But it's important to note that due to the limitations of the information, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, the attacker is most likely white based on population statistics}
