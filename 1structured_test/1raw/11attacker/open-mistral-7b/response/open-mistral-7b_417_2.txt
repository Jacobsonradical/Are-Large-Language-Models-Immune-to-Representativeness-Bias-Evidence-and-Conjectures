To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider two scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually black, and the witness correctly identifies the race.
2. The attacker is actually white, and the witness mistakenly identifies the race as black.

We are given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(white) = 1 - P(black).

Given that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is P(black) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a white attacker as black is P(white) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and of the witness erroneously identifying a white attacker as black:

P(attacker is black) = P(witness correctly identifies black) + P(witness erroneously identifies white as black)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker is black) = (P(black) * 0.8) + (P(white) * 0.2)

We can solve this equation for P(black) by using the fact that P(black) + P(white) = 1:

P(black) = (P(attacker is black) - P(white) * 0.2) / 0.8

Substituting the given values for P(white) and the witness's error rate, we get:

P(black) = (P(attacker is black) - 0.15 * 0.2) / 0.8

P(attacker is black) = 0.6

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.6 or 60%. This estimate is based on the witness's ability to identify race and the demographics of the city. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified model and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world situations.
