Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means the witness's error rate (20%) applies to the case where the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85 (85%). Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this means their error occurred. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's error, is equal to the witness's error rate (20%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
