Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, based on the witness's observation, is 0.8.

However, we should also consider the racial composition of the city, as the attacker could be a member of the majority or minority population. According to the second piece of information, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a statistical formula to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. The formula is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (0.8, according to the witness's ability)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (0.15, given the racial composition of the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | not H), but we don't have enough information to calculate this)

Unfortunately, without knowing P(E), we cannot calculate the exact probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. However, we can still make an approximate estimation.

Since P(E | not H) is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2, and P(E) should be close to 1, we can assume that P(E | not H) is a small fraction of 1. Therefore, P(E | not H) is likely much less than 0.1.

Given that P(E | not H) is much smaller than P(E | H), we can approximate P(H | E) as roughly equal to P(E | H) * P(H).

So, our approximate estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12}

This estimate suggests that, considering both the witness's ability and the racial composition of the city, the attacker has a 12% chance of being black. However, it's important to note that this is an approximation and the actual probability could be different.
