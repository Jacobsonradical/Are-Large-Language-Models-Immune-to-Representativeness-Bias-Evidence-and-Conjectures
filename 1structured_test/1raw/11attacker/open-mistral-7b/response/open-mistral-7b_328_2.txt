To provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial distribution in the city.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, this means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. And we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Let's denote W as the witness's statement that the attacker is black, and E as the event that the attacker is actually black. The probability P(W|E) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race given that the attacker is indeed black.

P(W|E) = Probability of witness correctly identifying black person
        = 0.8

Now, let's denote C as the complementary event that the attacker is white. The probability P(C) is 85% (as given in the information).

The probability P(C|W) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(C|W) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability P(E|W), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

But we can't directly calculate P(W), the probability of the witness making a statement about a black attacker, since we don't have the exact number of black people in the city. However, we can assume that P(W) is proportional to P(E) because the witness makes a statement based on what they observed, and the number of black and white people in the city should influence the number of times they observe a black or white person.

Given that P(E) = 0.15, we can assume that P(W) is also approximately 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(E|W):

P(E|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.15 * P(E|C) + 0.8 * P(E|W))

We don't have P(E|C), but we can assume it's equal to P(W|C), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(W|C) = 0.2.

So, P(E|W) = (0.12) / (0.15 * 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.2)

After calculating, we get:

P(E|W) â‰ˆ 0.6

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.6 or 60%.
