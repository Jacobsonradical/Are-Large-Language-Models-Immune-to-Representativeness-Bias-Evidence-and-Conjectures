Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H):
- P(H) = Number of black attackers / Total number of attackers
- Since we cannot see the race of the attacker, we can only use the population demographics as a rough estimate. So, P(H) ≈ 0.15 (15% of the population is black)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis P(E | H):
- P(E | H) = Witness's accuracy rate when identifying black people
- The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(E | H) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis P(E | ¬H):
- P(E | ¬H) = Witness's error rate when identifying black people
- The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(E | ¬H) = 0.2

Now, let's calculate the probability of the evidence P(E):
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)
- Since we don't have the prior probability of the opposite hypothesis P(¬H), we can't directly calculate P(E). However, we can use the total population percentage to estimate P(¬H) ≈ 0.85 (85% of the population is white).

Using this estimate, P(E) ≈ 0.12 (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence P(H | E):
- P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
- P(H | E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 ≈ 0.75

So, based on the provided information and Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
