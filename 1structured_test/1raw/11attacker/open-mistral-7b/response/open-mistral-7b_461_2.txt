Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of erring. If the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possibilities: either the attacker is actually black and the witness correctly identified him, or the attacker is white and the witness made an error.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is P(black) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error and mistakenly identifying a white person as black is P(white) * 0.2, where P(white) is the probability of the attacker being white.

We know that the witness identified the attacker as black, so the observed event is P(black) * 0.8 + P(white) * 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black).

We also know that 85% of the population is white, so P(white) = 0.85.

Substituting this into the equation, we get 0.8 = 0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * 0.85. Solving for P(black), we get P(black) = 0.5.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.5 or 50%.
