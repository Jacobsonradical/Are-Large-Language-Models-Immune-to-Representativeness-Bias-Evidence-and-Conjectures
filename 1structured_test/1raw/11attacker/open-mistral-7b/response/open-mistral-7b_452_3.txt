Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is that the attacker is black. The prior knowledge is the distribution of races in the city. The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given by the witness's accuracy: P(W|B) = 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black (given by the witness's error rate: P(W|~B) = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of an attacker being non-black (given by the city's demographics: P(~B) = 0.85)

By Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values from the given information, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the city's demographics and the witness's accuracy. The estimate is lower than the city's demographic proportion of black people due to the witness's error rate.
