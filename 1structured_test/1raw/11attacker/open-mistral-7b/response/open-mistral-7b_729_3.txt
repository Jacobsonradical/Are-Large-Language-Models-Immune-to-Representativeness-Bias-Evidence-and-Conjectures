To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(W) = 1 - P(B).

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 0.8, and they make errors 0.2 of the time. When the witness identifies someone as black, there are two possibilities:

1. The person is indeed black (true positive, TP), or
2. The person is white (false positive, FP).

The probability of a TP is P(B), and the probability of a FP is P(W) * 0.2 (the error rate).

The witness's identification of the attacker as black means there was a TP or a FP. So, we have the equation:

0.8 = P(B) + P(W) * 0.2

Simplifying the equation:

0.8 = P(B) + (1 - P(B)) * 0.2

0.8 = 0.2P(B) + 0.2

0.6P(B) = 0.2

P(B) = 0.2 / 0.6 = 0.33 (or 33%)

However, this estimate might significantly underestimate the true probability, given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is because the witness's error rate is calculated on a random sample of people, which may not represent the racial composition of the attackers in the city.

In reality, the attackers in the city might be more racially similar to the attacker described in this case, which could mean that the witness's error rate might not be as high when identifying attackers as it is when identifying random people.

To account for this, we can adjust the error rate to better reflect the racial composition of attackers in the city. If we assume that the attackers in the city are more likely to be black than the general population, we can reduce the false positive rate.

Let's assume that the true error rate when identifying attackers is 0.15 (instead of 0.2). In this case, we can calculate a new, adjusted probability:

0.8 = P(B) + (1 - P(B)) * 0.15

0.8 = P(B) + 0.15 - 0.15P(B)

0.65P(B) = 0.15

P(B) = 0.15 / 0.65 â‰ˆ 0.23 (or 23%)

In conclusion, given the limited information we have, it seems reasonable to estimate that the attacker is black with a probability between 0.23 and 0.33, but a more precise estimate would require additional information about the racial composition of attackers in the city.
