To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

From the information provided, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

We can represent this situation as a conditional probability problem: P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = Number of times witness correctly identifies black attacker / Total number of times witness identifies attacker

Let's break it down:
1. Number of times witness correctly identifies black attacker: This is the probability of a black attacker multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying black people. P(Black attacker) * 0.8
2. Total number of times witness identifies attacker: This is the sum of the probabilities of a black attacker and a white attacker, each multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying their respective races. P(Black attacker) * 0.8 + P(White attacker) * 0.2

We know that P(Black attacker) + P(White attacker) = 1 (total probability), and P(White attacker) = 0.85 (from the given information).

Now, we can set up the equation: P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) = (P(Black attacker) * 0.8) / (P(Black attacker) * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)

To solve for P(Black attacker), we can rearrange the equation and use the fact that P(Black attacker) + P(White attacker) = 1:

P(Black attacker) = (P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) * (0.85 * 0.2)) / 0.8

Substituting the given value of P(Attacker is black | Witness's identification) (which we want to find), we get:

P(Black attacker) = (0.x * 0.17) / 0.8

Solving for x gives us an estimate of 0.3125 or 31.25% that the attacker is black.

However, the given probabilities are percentages, and the result we found is a fraction, so we should convert it back to a percentage:

P(Attacker is black) = 0.3125 * 100 = 31.25%

So, based on the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 31.25%.
