Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The population statistics indicate that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem is defined as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, we want to find P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would make the statement "I saw a black person" if the attacker was indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can calculate from the population statistics. P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

P(E) is the probability of the witness making the statement "I saw a black person", regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying race, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17 (17%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.471

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.471 or 47.1%.
