Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker's race being black. The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given by the city's demographics: 15% or 0.15)
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given by their performance: 80% or 0.8)
P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given by their performance: 20% or 0.2)
P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (given by the city's demographics: 85% or 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2368

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23.68%.
