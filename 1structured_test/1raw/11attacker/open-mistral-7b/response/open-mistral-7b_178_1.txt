Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (as stated in the first piece of information). However, we don't have direct information about the attacker's race. The witness identified the attacker as black, but there's a 20% chance that the witness could have made an error.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black (as stated in the second piece of information). If we assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

The witness's identification could be correct or an error. If the witness's identification is correct, the attacker is indeed black. In this case, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (the proportion of blacks in the population).

If the witness's identification is an error, it means the attacker is actually white. The probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (as stated in the first piece of information). Since the population is 85% white, the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness made an error is 0.85 (the proportion of whites in the population).

The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2. So, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of the attacker being black given a correct identification and the attacker being white given an error, multiplied by the probabilities of each event.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.17 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.034 = 0.154 (or 15.4%).

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case. If the error rate is higher when the witness misidentifies a black person as white, the attacker is likely to be black with a higher probability than estimated. Conversely, if the error rate is higher when the witness misidentifies a white person as black, the attacker is likely to be black with a lower probability than estimated. Without more information about the witness's error rate and any potential bias, it's difficult to make a more precise estimate.

{probability: 0.154, note: This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case.}
