To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, the hypothesis H is the attacker being black, the evidence E is the witness's identification, and we have the following prior probabilities and likelihoods:

1. P(H) = Probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's identification. This can be estimated from the city's population statistics: P(H) = 0.15 (15% black population).

2. P(E|H) = Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given by the witness's accuracy rate: P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% accuracy).

3. P(H|E) = The probability we're interested in, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.

4. P(E) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of whether they are black or not. This can be calculated as the sum of the product of the prior probability of the attacker being black or white and the likelihood of the witness identifying them as black: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H). Here, ~H denotes the attacker being white.

5. P(E|~H) = Likelihood of the witness identifying someone as black given that the attacker is white. This is given by the witness's error rate: P(E|~H) = 0.2 (20% error).

Now, we can calculate P(E) and then use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48. This means that, based on this information, it is estimated that the attacker is about 48% likely to be black.
