Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, the attacker's race was not directly observed, but rather inferred by the witness.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black is 0.8 (80%). However, this does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black, as the witness could have made an error.

The probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is black is 0.2 (20%). Given that the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of an attacker being black is 0.15 (15%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is black, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black.

So, 0.8 (witness's correct rate) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) = 0.12 (probability estimate of the attacker being black).

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker is black is 0.12.
