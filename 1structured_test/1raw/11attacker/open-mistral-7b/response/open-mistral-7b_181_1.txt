The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual race of the attacker, then we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker, and P(B|¬A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker (where ¬A denotes the complement of event A, i.e., the attacker being non-black).

We have P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|¬A) = 0.2, and P(A) is what we want to find. We also have P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) because the total probability of both events A and ¬A is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values, we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))]

Solving this equation for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * P(A))

Rearranging to solve for P(A), we have:

P(A) = (0.8 * P(A|B)) / 0.8

Substituting the value of P(A|B) from the previous equation, we get:

P(A) = (0.8 * (0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * P(A)))) / 0.8

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.64 / (1 + 0.16 * P(A))

To find the value of P(A) that satisfies this equation, we can use numerical methods or trial and error. A close approximation is P(A) ≈ 0.23.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the population, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 23%.
