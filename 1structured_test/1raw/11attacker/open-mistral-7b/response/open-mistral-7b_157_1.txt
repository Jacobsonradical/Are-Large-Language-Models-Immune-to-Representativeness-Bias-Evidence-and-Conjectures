To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial distribution of the city's population.

Let's denote:
P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
P(W) as the probability that the attacker is white

We know that the witness identifies the race correctly with a probability of 0.8 and errs with a probability of 0.2. Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, it means that the attacker is actually white. Therefore, the probability of an error given that the attacker is white is equal to the probability of a correct identification given that the attacker is black:

P(err | W) = P(correct | B)

We are given that the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases, so:

0.2 = 0.8 * P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.25

However, the witness's statement about the attacker being black might be an error. In this case, we should consider the racial distribution of the city's population to find the probability that the witness's statement is correct, given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black:

P(B | statement) = P(statement | B) * P(B) + P(statement | ¬B) * P(¬B)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies the race 20% of the time, and the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness's statement being correct given that the attacker is white is 0.2, and the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect is 0.8.

Similarly, the probability of the witness's statement being correct given that the attacker is black is 1, and the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect is 0.

Substituting these probabilities in the equation above, we get:

P(B | statement) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.1825

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.1825. This is significantly lower than the witness's estimate of 0.8, suggesting that the witness might have made an error. However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness was telling the truth and that the attacker was indeed black, despite the low probability given the racial distribution of the city's population.
