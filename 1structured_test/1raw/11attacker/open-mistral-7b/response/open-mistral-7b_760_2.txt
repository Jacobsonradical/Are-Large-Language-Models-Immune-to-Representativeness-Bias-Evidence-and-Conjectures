Given the information provided, the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's race and a 20% chance of making an error. If we assume that the witness made an error in this case (since the victim could not see the attacker's race), then the probability that the attacker is actually black is the inverse of the probability of the witness making an error.

The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (or 20%). So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

However, the witness's statement that the attacker is black cannot be taken at face value, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race. Therefore, we cannot use the witness's statement as evidence in estimating the probability that the attacker is black.

Given this limitation, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the information provided. The best estimate would be to use the city's population demographics, which are 85% white and 15% black (as in point b). This would suggest a probability of 0.15 (or 15%) that the attacker is black. However, this estimate is likely to be inaccurate, given that the victim could not see the attacker's race and the witness's statement may not be reliable.
