Given the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is usually correct in identifying race 80% of the time identified the attacker as black. This suggests that while the attacker might actually be white (given the population statistics), the witness's error rate makes it unlikely that they mistakenly identified a white person as black.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake in this case. If the attacker is white, the probability of the witness identifying them as black is their error rate of 20%. If the attacker is black, the probability of the witness correctly identifying them is 80%.

Let P(W) be the probability that the attacker is white, and P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. We are given that P(W) = 0.85 and P(B) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is white is P(W) * 0.20. The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is black is P(B) * 0.80.

Since the witness's statement is what we observe, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(B | statement) = (P(statement | B) * P(B)) / (P(statement | B) * P(B) + P(statement | W) * P(W))

Plugging in the probabilities, we get:

P(B | statement) = (0.15 * 0.80) / ((0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20)) = 0.12 / 0.234 = 0.51

So, given the witness's statement, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 51%. This is a higher probability than what we would expect based on the city's demographics alone, suggesting that the witness's identification might be reliable in this case. However, it's important to note that this is a complex problem with many variables, and the actual probability could be different based on other factors not accounted for in this analysis.
