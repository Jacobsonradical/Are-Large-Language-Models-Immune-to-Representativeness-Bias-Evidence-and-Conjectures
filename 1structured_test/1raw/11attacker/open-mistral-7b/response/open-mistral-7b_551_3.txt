Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, but we also know that 85% of the population is white. This means that, based on the witness's observations alone, the probability that the attacker is white would be higher than the actual proportion of black people in the city.

However, the witness also made mistakes 20% of the time. Some of these mistakes could have been misidentifying whites as blacks, which would lower the estimated probability of the attacker being black.

On the other hand, some of the witness's mistakes could have been misidentifying blacks as whites, which would increase the estimated probability of the attacker being black. Without more information about the distribution of these errors, it's impossible to determine the exact number.

Therefore, given the information provided, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. However, we can say that the probability is likely to be higher than 15%, but lower than 80%. A more detailed analysis would require additional information, such as the distribution of the witness's errors.
