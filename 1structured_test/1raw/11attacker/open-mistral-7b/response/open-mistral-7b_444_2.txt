To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness statement). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identifies black people) given the hypothesis. This can be calculated as the reliability of the witness in identifying race, which is 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence. This can be estimated using the population statistics.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the probability of the witness making the statement, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness making a correct identification (0.8) times the probability of the attacker being black (P(H)) plus the probability of the witness making an error (0.2) times the probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(H)).

So, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * P(H)] / [0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H))]

We know that 85% of the population is white, so 15% is black. Therefore, P(H) = 0.15.

Substituting this value into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.8

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement, is 0.8 or 80%. This is consistent with the witness's reliability in identifying race, but it may not necessarily reflect the true probability of the attacker's race, as the witness's statement may not be fully reliable or representative.
