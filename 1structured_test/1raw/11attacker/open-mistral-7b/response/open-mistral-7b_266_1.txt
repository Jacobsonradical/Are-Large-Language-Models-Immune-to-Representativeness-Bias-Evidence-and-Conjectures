To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(Black), and the probability that the attacker is white as P(White) = 1 - P(Black).

The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability that they correctly identify a black person as black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that a randomly selected person is black is 0.15.

Since the witness is equally likely to observe a white or black person, and they identify a black person as black with probability 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

However, we don't have enough information to know if the attacker was misidentified by the witness or not. Therefore, we can only use the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as evidence for the attacker being black.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, which is 0.12.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12}
