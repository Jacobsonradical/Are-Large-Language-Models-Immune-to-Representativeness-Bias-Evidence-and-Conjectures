Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- θ: The true population proportion of blacks in the city
- E: The witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of information:
1) P(H) = θ, the prior probability of the attacker being black, given that we know the population composition. As you mentioned, 85% of the city's population is white, so the proportion of blacks is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

2) P(E | H) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.

3) P(E | ~H) = 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / [P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the given probabilities into the formula:

P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

To simplify the calculation, let's first find the denominator:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(H | E) = 0.12 / 0.24 = 0.5

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.5. This means that, according to the Bayesian analysis, the witness's identification of the attacker as black makes it equally likely that the attacker is black or white. However, it's important to keep in mind that this analysis relies on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability could be different in reality.
