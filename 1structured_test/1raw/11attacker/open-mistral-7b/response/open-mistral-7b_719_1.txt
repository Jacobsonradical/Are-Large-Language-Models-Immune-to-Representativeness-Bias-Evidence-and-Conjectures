Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

In this case, our event is that the attacker is black, and our new evidence is the witness's statement. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the event A given the evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of observing the evidence B given that the event A is true
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A
- P(B) is the probability of observing the evidence B

We are given the prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) as 15% (0.15), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as 80% (0.8). We are also given that the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, which means the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 20% (0.2).

The probability of the witness making the statement "the attacker is black" given that the attacker is black is P(B|A) = 0.8. The probability of the witness making the statement "the attacker is black" given that the attacker is white is P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of observing the witness's statement "the attacker is black" is P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.242.

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.242 = 0.294 or 29.4%

So, given the evidence, the probability that the attacker is black is estimated to be approximately 29.4%.
