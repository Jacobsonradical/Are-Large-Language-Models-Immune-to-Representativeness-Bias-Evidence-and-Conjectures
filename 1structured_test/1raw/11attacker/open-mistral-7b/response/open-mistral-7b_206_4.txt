Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The racial makeup of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(Black) as the probability of the attacker being black
- P(White) as the probability of the attacker being white
- P(Witness|Black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(Witness|White) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black
- P(Witness) as the overall probability that the witness makes a correct identification

We are given that P(Witness|Black) = 0.8, P(Witness|White) = 0.2, and P(Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(Black|Witness) = [P(Witness|Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Black|Witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.357

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.357 or 35.7%.
