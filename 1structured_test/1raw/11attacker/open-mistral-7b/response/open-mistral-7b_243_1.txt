To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the population.

1. The witness is reliable 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness says black)

Where P(witness says black | attacker is black) is the reliability of the witness for identifying black people, which is 0.8;
P(attacker is black) is the actual probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find;
P(witness says black) is the overall probability of the witness saying "black", which is a weighted average of the two probabilities: P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white).

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2. Also, P(attacker is white) = 1 - P(attacker is black) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(black) = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) / (0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.2 * P(attacker is white))

P(black) = 0.8 * P(attacker is black) / (0.8 * P(attacker is black) + 0.2 * 0.15)

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.03)

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
