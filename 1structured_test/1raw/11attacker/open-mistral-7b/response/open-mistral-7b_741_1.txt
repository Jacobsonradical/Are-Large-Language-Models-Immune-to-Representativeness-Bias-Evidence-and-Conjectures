To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is indeed black, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
b) The attacker is white, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

The probability of scenario a is the proportion of black people in the city. Since 15% of the population is black, the probability of scenario a is 0.15 (or 15%).

The probability of scenario b is the proportion of white people in the city times the probability that the witness makes an error in identifying race. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of scenario b is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

The overall probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of scenarios a and b:

Total probability = Probability of scenario a + Probability of scenario b
                         = 0.15 + 0.17
                         = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.32 (or 32%). This means that, based on the available information, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black, but there is still a reasonable chance that the witness made a mistake.
