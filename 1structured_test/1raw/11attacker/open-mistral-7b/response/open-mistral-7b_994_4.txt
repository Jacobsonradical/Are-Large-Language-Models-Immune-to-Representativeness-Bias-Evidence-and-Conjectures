To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker being black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person. This is given as 0.8.
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black. Given that 85% of the population is white, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can calculate this as P(W|~B) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black. This is 1 - P(B) = 1 - P(B).
- P(W) as the probability of the witness making the observed identification. This is the weighted sum of the two probabilities: P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B).

We want to find P(B) given P(W). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

Given that we want an estimate for P(B), we can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(B):

P(B) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

Now, we can plug in the known values:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(B) / (0.8 * P(B) + 0.03 * (1 - P(B)))

We can simplify this equation to:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(B) / (0.8 * P(B) + 0.03)

To solve this equation, we need an additional piece of information, which is the value of P(B). However, since we are asked to estimate P(B), we can use the equation to find an estimate that satisfies it.

One way to do this is by trial and error. We can start with a guess for P(B) and see if the resulting P(B|W) is reasonable. For example, if P(B) = 0.2 (i.e., the attacker is 20% likely to be black), then P(B|W) = 0.64, which is not very likely given the 85% white population. On the other hand, if P(B) = 0.8 (i.e., the attacker is 80% likely to be black), then P(B|W) = 0.92, which is quite likely.

Therefore, based on the given information, an estimate for the probability that the attacker is black would be around 0.8.
