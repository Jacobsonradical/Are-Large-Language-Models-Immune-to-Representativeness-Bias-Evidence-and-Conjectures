Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of H, P(H), which is the probability that the attacker is black in the general population, given to be 15%.
2. The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This is given to be 80%.
3. The likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|~H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black. This is given to be 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
