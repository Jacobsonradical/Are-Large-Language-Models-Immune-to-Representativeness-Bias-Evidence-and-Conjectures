To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is black
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We are given two probabilities:

1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
2. P(W|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
3. P(W|~A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 in the problem statement, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time.
4. P(~A): The prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(A). Since 15% of the population is black, this means P(~A) = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.188 or 18.8%. This means that despite the witness's identification, the actual probability of the attacker being black is relatively low, given the racial composition of the city.
