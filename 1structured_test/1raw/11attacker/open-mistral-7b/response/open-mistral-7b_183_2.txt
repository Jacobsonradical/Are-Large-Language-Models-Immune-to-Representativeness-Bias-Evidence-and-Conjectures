Given the two pieces of information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. The attacker is black (E1)
2. The witness identified the attacker as black (E2)

The probability of each event is as follows:
P(E1) = Probability of the attacker being black in the city, given by the population statistics: P(E1) = 0.15

P(E2 | E1) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(E2 | E1) = 0.8

P(E2 | ~E1) = Probability that the witness mistakes a white person for black. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E2 | ~E1) = 0.2

P(~E1) = Probability of the attacker being white: P(~E1) = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(E1 | E2) = [P(E2 | E1) * P(E1)] / [P(E2 | E1) * P(E1) + P(E2 | ~E1) * P(~E1)]

Plugging in the values:
P(E1 | E2) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(E1 | E2) â‰ˆ 0.28 or 28%

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.28 or 28%. This is significantly lower than the 85% white population, suggesting that the witness's identification may not be accurate. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical calculation based on the given information and may not perfectly represent the actual situation.
