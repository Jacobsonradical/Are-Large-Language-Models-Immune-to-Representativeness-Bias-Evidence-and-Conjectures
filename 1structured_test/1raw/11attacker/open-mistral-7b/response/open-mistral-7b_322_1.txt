Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The demographic distribution of the city's population, with 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important detail missing in the information: we don't know if the witness made a correct or incorrect identification in this specific case. Without knowing that, we can't make a definitive estimate.

So, the best we can do is provide two possible scenarios based on the available information:

1. If the witness made an error in this case, then the attacker is likely white, given the city's demographic distribution. In this scenario, the probability of the attacker being black would be lower than 15%.
2. If the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, then the probability of the attacker being black would be 80%, based on the witness's track record.

Without more information, we can't provide a single probability estimate. Therefore, our answer is:

{probability: "Unable to provide a single probability, see explanation above"}
