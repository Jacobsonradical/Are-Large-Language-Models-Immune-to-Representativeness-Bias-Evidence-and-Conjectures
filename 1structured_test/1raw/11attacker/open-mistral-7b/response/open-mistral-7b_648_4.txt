Given the information provided, the attacker being identified as black by the witness does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80%, and they err 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black, it would seem more likely that the attacker is white. However, without knowing the specific error rate of the witness when identifying white people, we cannot make a definitive statement about the probability of the attacker being black.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / [P(Witness identification)]

However, we only have the information for P(Witness identification | Attacker is black) and P(Attacker is black). We do not have the information for P(Witness identification), which is the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the attacker's race.

Without this information, it is not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. However, we can make an approximation based on the given information.

Let's assume that the witness's error rate is the same for both white and black people (this is not necessarily true, but it simplifies the calculation). In that case, the probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.2.

If the witness makes an error and identifies a white person as black, that would increase the apparent probability of a black attacker. This would bias the estimate towards a higher probability of a black attacker than what is actually the case.

Given this, it would seem that the probability of the attacker being black is less than 15%, but it may be significantly more than that due to the witness's error rate. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a precise number.

{probability: less than 15%, but significantly more than that due to witness error rate, please consult a statistician for a more precise estimate}
