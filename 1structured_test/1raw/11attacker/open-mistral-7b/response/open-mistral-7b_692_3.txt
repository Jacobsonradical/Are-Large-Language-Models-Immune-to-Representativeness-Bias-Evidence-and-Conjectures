Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population, with 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race under similar conditions, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Black Attacker | Witness Description) = [P(Witness Describes Black | Black Attacker) * P(Black Attacker)] / [P(Witness Describes Black)]

Let's break this down:

1. We know that P(Black Attacker) = 0.15 (15%).
2. The witness's success rate is 0.8, and the error rate is 0.2. So, P(Witness Describes Black | Black Attacker) = 0.8, and P(Witness Describes Black | Not Black Attacker) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).
3. P(Witness Describes Black) = P(Witness Describes Black | Black Attacker) * P(Black Attacker) + P(Witness Describes Black | Not Black Attacker) * P(Not Black Attacker) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.25.

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Black Attacker | Witness Description) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.25 = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
