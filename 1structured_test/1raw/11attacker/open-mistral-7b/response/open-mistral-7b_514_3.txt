Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, with a slight bias towards identifying people as black when they are actually white (erring 22% of the time when identifying whites and only 14% of the time when identifying blacks).

Given this information, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually black. The witness's error rate suggests that their identification could be influenced by factors other than the attacker's actual race.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

To calculate P(E|H), we can use the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black people:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying black people)

To calculate P(H), we can use the racial composition of the city:

P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is black)

To calculate P(E), we can use the witness's overall error rate and the racial composition of the city:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

where P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, and P(not H) is the probability that a random person in the city is white.

Since the witness errs more often when identifying white people as black than when identifying black people as black, we can assume that P(E|not H) < 0.8. However, without specific data on this error rate, we cannot calculate an exact value for P(E|not H) or P(not H).

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a strict numerical estimate for P(H|E) using the given information. However, we can say that, given the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city, it is likely that the attacker is white, and the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error.

It is strongly recommended to gather more information or conduct further investigations to improve the accuracy of this estimate.
