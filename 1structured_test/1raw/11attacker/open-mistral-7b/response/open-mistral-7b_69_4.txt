To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

P(B|A) is the reliability of the witness, which we know is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find.
P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are black (0.8) or given that they are white (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).

We cannot directly calculate P(B) because we do not have enough information about the witness's reliability in incorrectly identifying race. However, we can calculate P(A|B) given P(B|A) and P(B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * P(A) + 0.17 * (1 - P(A)))

We can solve this equation for P(A). However, we do not have enough information about the witness's reliability in incorrectly identifying race (P(not black|black)) to solve the equation exactly.

Therefore, I cannot provide a precise number for the probability that the attacker is black. However, we can make an approximate estimate based on the city's racial composition.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be white than black, especially since the witness's ability to correctly identify race is not perfect.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be lower than 0.15 (15%), but higher than 0.08 (80% * 0.15 = 12%). However, without more information, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.
