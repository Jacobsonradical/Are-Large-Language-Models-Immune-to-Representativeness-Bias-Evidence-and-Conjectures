Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate, and the error rate is 20%.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means their identification was either correct or an error. However, we don't have information on whether their identification was correct or not in this specific case.

Since the witness's accuracy is only considered in a general context, we cannot directly apply it to this specific incident where the witness's certainty might be higher or lower. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information.
