To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. Since the majority of the city's population is white (85%), it is more likely that the witness would err by misidentifying a white person as black than by misidentifying a black person as white.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as p. Then, the probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is black (which is what happened) is 1 - p.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can set up an equation to find our estimate of p:

1 - p = 0.2

Solving for p, we get:

p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the actual attacker's race and that the city's population distribution remains constant.
