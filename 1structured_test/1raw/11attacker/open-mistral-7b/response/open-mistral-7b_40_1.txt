Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we only have this information for the witness's performance in general and not specifically in the dark or at night.

The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. But we don't know if the witness's performance in race identification is biased towards one race or if it's unbiased. If the witness's performance is unbiased, then the probability of the attacker being black would be the same as the city's population percentage, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, if the witness's performance is biased, this could potentially skew the probability. Without more specific information about the witness's performance in the relevant conditions, it's impossible to provide a more precise estimate.

Therefore, based on the information given, the best estimate would be {probability: 0.15}. But this is a simplification and may not fully account for potential biases in the witness's race identification ability.
