Based on the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any direct evidence about the race of the attacker, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A (the attacker being black).
- P(B) is the probability of event B (the witness identifying the attacker as black).
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A (the probability that the witness identifies a black person correctly).

We know the prior probability P(A) = 15% (since 15% of the city's population is black). The likelihood P(B|A) is given to us as 80% (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time).

However, we need to estimate P(B) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black). Since we don't have information about the race of the attacker, we can assume that the attacker could be either black or white. Let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker (event B1) and a white attacker (event B2) separately:

P(B1) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B2) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability of event B (the witness identifying the attacker as black) as the sum of the probabilities of event B1 and event B2:

P(B) = P(B1) + P(B2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 48%.
