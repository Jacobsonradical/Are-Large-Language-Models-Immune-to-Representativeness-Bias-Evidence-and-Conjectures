Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness in identifying race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, while they err 20% of the time.

When the witness identifies a person as black, there are two possibilities:

a) The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed black.
b) The witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually white.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can estimate that they err in identifying a white person as black 20% of the time. This means that out of the 15% of the population that is black, 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. However, we also need to account for the times when the witness errs in identifying a white person as black.

To do this, we can multiply the 20% error rate by the 85% white population proportion. This gives us 17% of the time when a white person is mistakenly identified as black. Since the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time, the remaining 20% of the time they are mistaken. So, out of the 17% of misidentified white people, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, or 3.4% of the time.

Now we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which includes both when the witness is correct and when they are mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Total probability of identifying attacker as black = 80% (correctly identifying a black person) + 3.4% (mistakenly identifying a white person as black)

Total probability of identifying attacker as black = 0.8 + 0.034 = 0.834 or 83.4%

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 83.4%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's performance in this specific situation is representative of their ability to judge race under similar conditions. If this assumption is not valid, then the estimated probability may not be accurate.
