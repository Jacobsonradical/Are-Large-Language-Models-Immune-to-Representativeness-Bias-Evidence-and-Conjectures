The probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is that the attacker is black
- Event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% white, so 15% black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (since P(A) + P(not A) = 1)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15]
       = 0.12 / 0.72
       = 0.17

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.17 or 17%.
