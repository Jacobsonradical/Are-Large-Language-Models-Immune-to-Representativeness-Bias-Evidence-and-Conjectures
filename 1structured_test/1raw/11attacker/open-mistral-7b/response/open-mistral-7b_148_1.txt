To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, our prior knowledge is the racial composition of the city, and our new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem is usually written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which in this case is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is black, which is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 0.15 (15%) from the problem statement.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the identification, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is not black, which is given as 0.2 in the problem statement, and P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being black, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.2857 or 28.57%.
