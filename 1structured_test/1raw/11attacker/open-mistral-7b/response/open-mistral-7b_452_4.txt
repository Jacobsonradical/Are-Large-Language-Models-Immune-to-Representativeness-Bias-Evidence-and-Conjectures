To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify the race 80% of the time. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, we can expect that a random person on the street is white 85% of the time and black 15% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a race 20% of the time, we can assume that they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time. This means that when they identify a person as black, there is a 72% chance that they are correct (since they get it right 80% of the time and they err in identifying a white person as black 20% of the time).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.72.

Therefore, {probability: 0.72}
