The given information suggests that in the general population, 85% of people are white, and 15% are black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy in identifying race is only 80% under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black.
- P(W|~B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (white).
- P(B) = 0.15 (given in the problem)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (1 - P(B))
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (given in the problem)
- P(W|~B) = 0.2 (1 - P(W|B))

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.186

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18.6%.
