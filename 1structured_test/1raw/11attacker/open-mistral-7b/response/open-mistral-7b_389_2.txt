To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying race 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's description) = [P(Witness's description | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness's description | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness's description | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

We know:
P(Witness's description | Attacker is Black) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
P(Witness's description | Attacker is White) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability)
P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 (from the city's racial composition)
P(Attacker is White) = 0.85 (from the city's racial composition)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness's description) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, is approximately 0.204.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 20.4%.
