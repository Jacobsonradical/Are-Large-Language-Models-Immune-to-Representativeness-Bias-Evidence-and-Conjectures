To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement. The theorem can be written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's statement)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (sum of the likelihood of the evidence given both hypotheses)

We are given the following information:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race)
2. P(not H) = 1 - P(H) (since there are only two races, black and white, and the sum of their probabilities must be 1)
3. P(E|not H) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's race, but for a white person)
4. P(H) = unknown (this is what we want to find)

We also know the population distribution:
5. P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)

However, we are given the witness's ability to judge a person's race under conditions similar to that night, but not the actual number of people in the sample. Without this information, we cannot calculate P(E), and therefore, we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E).

However, we can still provide an estimate based on the given information and the assumption that the witness's ability to judge a person's race is consistent across different populations. In this case, the witness is 80% accurate in identifying black people and 20% accurate in identifying white people. Given that the population is 85% white, it seems unlikely that the witness would identify a black person as black 80% of the time if the actual probability of the attacker being black is less than 15%.

Therefore, while we cannot provide a strictly numerical answer based on the given information, a reasonable estimate would be that the attacker is black with a probability greater than 15%. However, this estimate is based on an assumption and may not be accurate in all cases.
