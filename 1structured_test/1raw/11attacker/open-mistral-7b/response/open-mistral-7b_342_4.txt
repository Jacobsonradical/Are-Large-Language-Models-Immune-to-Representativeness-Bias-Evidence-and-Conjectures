Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is an estimate based on both the racial demographics of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

The city's racial demographics suggest that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. However, we also know that the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not perfect, with an error rate of 20%.

The witness identified the attacker as black, but we can't ignore the possibility of an error. If the witness made an error, they would have incorrectly identified a white person as black. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, if the witness correctly identified the attacker, they would have correctly identified a black person. Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability of this happening is 0.15.

Since we don't know whether the witness made an error or not, we can't assign a single probability to the attacker being black. Instead, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification and the city's demographics.

This can be done using Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the evidence (witness's identification).
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identified a black person).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of attacker being black in the city).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness made a correct identification).

We already know P(H) and P(E | H). To calculate P(E), we can use the formula for P(E) as the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | ~H), where ~H is the negation of the hypothesis (attacker is not black).

Given that the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time and a white person 20% of the time, we can calculate P(E | H) = 0.8 and P(E | ~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97 or 97%.

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H | E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.97

This calculation gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics:

{probability: 0.1526 or 15.26%, please note that this is an estimate and the actual probability may differ}
