Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. Event A: The attacker is black.
2. Event E: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We also have two prior probabilities (before considering the evidence):
1. P(A): The probability that the attacker is black, given no other information. This is given as 15% in the question.

2. P(~A): The probability that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). This is given as 85% in the question.

And we have a conditional probability (given the evidence):
1. P(E|A): The probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 100% (or 1) in this case, as the witness correctly identified the attacker's race 100% of the time when the attacker was black.

2. P(E|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a white person as black, given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 20% in the question, as the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker is white.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability (after considering the evidence):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|E) = 1 * 0.15 / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the denominator:

1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Substituting the values back into the equation:

P(A|E) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, based on the given information and using Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46875, or 46.875%.
