The probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as the product of the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) and the prior probability of event A (P(A)), divided by the probability of event B (P(B)).

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified someone as black.

We have the following information:
1. Prior probability of the attacker being black: P(A) = 15% = 0.15
2. Probability of the witness identifying someone as black if the attacker is black: P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8
3. Probability of the witness identifying someone as black if the attacker is not black: P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2
4. Probability of the witness identifying someone as black: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified someone as black: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.75

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 75%. This means that given the information provided, there is a 75% chance that the attacker is black.
