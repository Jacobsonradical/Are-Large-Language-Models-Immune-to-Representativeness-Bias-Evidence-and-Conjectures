Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a 80% success rate and erred 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness makes a correct identification (i.e., the attacker is indeed black)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(W|not B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black

From the information given, we know that:

P(B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
P(W|not B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(W) directly, so we'll calculate it indirectly using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

We know that P(W|B) = 0.8, P(B) = 0.15, and P(W|not B) = 0.2. However, we don't have the value of P(not B) (the probability that the attacker is not black).

To calculate P(not B), we can use the fact that the total probability of all possible outcomes must equal 1:

P(B) + P(not B) = 1
so P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

However, we made an assumption in calculating P(not B) that might not hold true. Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|W) directly, we must conclude that without more information, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimation is based on the assumption that the population distribution is the same as the probability distribution of the witness's errors, which might not be the case. Therefore, this estimation should be considered with caution.
