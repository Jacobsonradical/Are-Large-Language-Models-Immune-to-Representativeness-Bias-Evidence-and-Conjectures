Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated by considering both the general population demographics and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

The population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is only 80% correct, meaning they mistakenly identify a race 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed black.
2. The attacker is white, but the witness mistakenly identified them as black.

The probability of the first scenario is the proportion of black people in the population, which is 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the second scenario is the proportion of white people in the population, multiplied by the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black. This is 0.85 (85%) * 0.2 (20%), which equals 0.17 (17%).

The total probability is the sum of these two probabilities, so:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, the attacker is black with a probability of 32%}

Although the majority of people in the city are white, the witness's error rate significantly reduces the likelihood that the attacker is white, given their identification.
