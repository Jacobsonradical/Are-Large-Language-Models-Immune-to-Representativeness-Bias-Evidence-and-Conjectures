Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is notoriously unreliable in identifying race (correctly doing so only 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time) has identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, and then multiply this by the actual proportion of black people in the city.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.8 (from information b). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is black).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white).

The total error rate of the witness is 0.2. Therefore, the error rate in identifying white people as black must be equal to the error rate in identifying black people as white, which is 0.2.

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = P(witness correctly identified attacker as black) / P(witness identified attacker as black)

P(witness correctly identified attacker as black) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a black person) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being black) + 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being white)

P(witness identified attacker as black) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24

So, P(attacker is black | witness's identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.625

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate in identifying black people as black is the same as the error rate in identifying white people as black. If the witness is systematically biased in one direction or the other, this calculation may not be accurate.

Therefore, strictly speaking, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.625, but this estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the unreliability of the witness. {probability: 0.625}
