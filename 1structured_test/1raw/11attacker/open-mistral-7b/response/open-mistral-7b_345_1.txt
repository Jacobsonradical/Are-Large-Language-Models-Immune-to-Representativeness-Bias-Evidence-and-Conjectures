Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. According to the first piece of information, 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80% under similar conditions, and they err 20% of the time.
3. The second piece of information states that the witness identified the attacker as black, but this identification might not be accurate due to the witness's error rate.

Therefore, we cannot directly use the 15% proportion of the black population in the city as our estimate for the attacker's race, considering the witness's error rate. Instead, we should consider the probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

1. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, and 85% of the population in the city is white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.
2. Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, it means that either the attacker is genuinely black (15%) or the witness made an error (17%).
3. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the genuine black population (15%) and the probability of the witness's error (17%): 15% + 17% = 0.32 or 32%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32 or 32%.
