Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

Let's break this down:

1. H: Attacker is black
2. E: Witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have:

- P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, so 15% black)
- P(E | H) = 1 (assuming a perfect witness in this scenario, but we're given a 80% correct rate)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.255

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.588

So, given the information and assuming a perfect witness in this scenario, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.588 or 58.8%. However, considering the witness's error rate of 20%, it's likely that the actual probability is lower. The question does not provide enough information to accurately calculate this value.
