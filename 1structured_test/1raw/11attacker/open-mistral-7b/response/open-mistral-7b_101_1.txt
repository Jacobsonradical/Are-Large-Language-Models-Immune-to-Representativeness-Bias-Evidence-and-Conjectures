Given the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as black. The reliability of the witness's race identification is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, and considering the witness's error rate, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black based on the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- p (probability that the attacker is black)
- q (probability that the attacker is white)

We know that p + q = 1

We also know that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2q.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write the following equation:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * q = 1

Given that p + q = 1, we can substitute p = 1 - q into the equation:

0.8 * (1 - q) + 0.2 * q = 1

Solving for q, we get:

q = 0.25

Substituting q back into the equation for p, we get:

p = 0.75

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.75 or 75%.
