Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of H, P(H), is given as 15% (from the city's population statistics). The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is given as the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks, which is 80%. The likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|~H), is the witness's error rate in identifying blacks, which is 20%.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.68 or 68%.
