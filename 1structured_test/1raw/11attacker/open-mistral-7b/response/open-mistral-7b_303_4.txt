Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have any information about the race of the people the witness encountered in their daily life. If the witness primarily interacts with white people, their 80% accuracy rate might be skewed towards identifying white people. On the other hand, if they interact with a mix of white and black people, their accuracy rate might be more representative of the actual population.

Without more information, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. But based on the witness's stated accuracy and the city's population demographics, we can make a rough estimate. If we assume that the witness's accuracy rate is a good representation of the actual population, then the attacker has a 15% chance (or probability) of being black, as that is the proportion of the city's population that is black.
