Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker's race, and we have two pieces of evidence:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being black: Since 15% of the population in the city is black, this is our prior belief.

2. Likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker's race: The witness identified the attacker as black with an 80% accuracy rate and erred 20% of the time. This means that when the attacker is actually black, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black 80% of the time, and when the attacker is white, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's statement, and we want to find P(A|B).

To compute this, we need the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black attacker 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being black)

The probability of the witness's statement, B, is given by the sum of the probabilities of the witness's statement given each race, weighted by the prior probabilities of those races:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.448

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.448, or 44.8%.
