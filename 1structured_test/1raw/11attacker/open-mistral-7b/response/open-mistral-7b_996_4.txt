Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

We cannot directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, as the witness saw the attacker under different conditions than the population statistics. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate an adjusted probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In our case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's description of the attacker as black, and the prior probability is the city's population statistics.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is black, P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, and P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15%), P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the error rate).

We also know that P(B) is the total probability of the witness describing the attacker as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A). Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(B|~A) = 0.2, and the total population is 1, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.625

So, given the witness's description and the city's population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 62.5%.
