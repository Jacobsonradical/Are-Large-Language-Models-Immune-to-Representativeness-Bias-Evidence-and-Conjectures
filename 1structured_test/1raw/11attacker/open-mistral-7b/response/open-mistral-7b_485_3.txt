Based on the information provided, the overall population distribution is 85% white and 15% black. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is only 80% correct and 20% erroneous. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is a chance that the witness made an error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness erroneously identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Given the witness's 80% accuracy, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that this identification is correct is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a white person as black.

So, P(black) = P(witness correctly identified black) + P(witness erroneously identified white as black)

P(black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, based on this analysis, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 29%.
