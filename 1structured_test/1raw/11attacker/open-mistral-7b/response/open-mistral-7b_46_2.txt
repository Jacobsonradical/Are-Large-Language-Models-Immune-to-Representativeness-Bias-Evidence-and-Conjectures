To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as "p" and the probability of the attacker being white as "1-p".

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the majority of the population is white, we can assume that the witness is more likely to encounter white people. Therefore, we can expect the witness to err more often when identifying a black person as white.

Let's denote the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white as "e". Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can write the equation:

0.8 = p + (1-p)e

We also know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so we can write another equation:

0.2 = (1-p) (1-e)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. Solving this system numerically gives us:

p = 0.142857 (approximately 14.29%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 14.29%.
