To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (also known as the likelihood)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down these probabilities:

1. P(E|H): The probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black. Since the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 15% of the city's population is black (from information "b"), this probability is 0.15.

3. P(E): The probability of the witness's testimony. Since the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, this probability is the sum of the probabilities of both correct and incorrect identifications. The probability of a correct identification is P(E|H) = 0.8, and the probability of an incorrect identification is P(E|~H) = 0.2 (where ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is not black). Since the witness identifies race correctly and incorrectly with equal probability, we can assume that P(E) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5
         = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
