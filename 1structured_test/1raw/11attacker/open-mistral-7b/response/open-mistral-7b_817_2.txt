Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental tool in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the attacker being black),
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the witness identifying a black person as the attacker),
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified a black person),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a black person as the attacker given that the attacker is black).

First, let's calculate P(B|A). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(A). According to the information given, the population is 85% white and 15% black. So, P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker being black).

Now, we need to calculate P(B). Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(B) = 0.2 (the witness identifying a black person as the attacker even if the attacker is white).

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2
          = 0.6

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.6 or 60%.
