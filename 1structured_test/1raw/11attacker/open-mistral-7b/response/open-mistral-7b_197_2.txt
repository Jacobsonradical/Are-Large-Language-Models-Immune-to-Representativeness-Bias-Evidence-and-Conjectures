Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know if their identification was correct or not, as they could have made an error.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness would have made an error, which happens 20% of the time.

Let's also assume that the attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness would have correctly identified the attacker 80% of the time.

Given these two scenarios, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the witness incorrectly identifying a white person.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.80 (80%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person is 0.20 (20%), given that 85% of the population is white.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually black is 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.7697 or approximately 77% (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.7697, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
