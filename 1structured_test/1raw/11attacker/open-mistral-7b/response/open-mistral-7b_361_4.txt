Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have any information about whether the witness saw the attacker under conditions similar to the city's population composition.

Assuming the witness's ability to judge a person's race remains the same regardless of the population composition, we can use the witness's error rate to adjust the city's population data. Since the error rate is 20%, this means that 20% of the time, the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black. Given that 85% of the city's population is white, this translates to 17% of the time the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black (0.2 * 0.85).

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black, this means that the actual proportion of black attackers in the city must be higher than the 15% that makes up the city's population. To find this proportion, we can subtract the probability of the witness making a mistake from 1.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.80 - 0.17 = 0.63, probability of the attacker being black is approximately 63%}
