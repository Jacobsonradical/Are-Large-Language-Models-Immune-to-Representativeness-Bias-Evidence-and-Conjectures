Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The two pieces of prior knowledge we have are the racial composition of the city (85% white, 15% black) and the witness's accuracy in identifying race (80% correct, 20% error).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence,
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

We can rewrite the formula to solve for P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
                 = 0.12 / 0.21
                 â‰ˆ 0.571

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, is approximately 0.571 or 57.1%.
