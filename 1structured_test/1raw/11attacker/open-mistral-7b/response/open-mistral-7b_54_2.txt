To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this context, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(A) = 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This is the sum of the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker (P(B|not A) * P(not A)).

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

So, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
