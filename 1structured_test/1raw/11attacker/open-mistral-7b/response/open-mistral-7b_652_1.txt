To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we have:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the probabilities of H and E|H, but we need to estimate P(E) to complete the calculation.

P(E|H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).
P(H) is given as 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% is black).

To estimate P(E), we can use the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
where ~H represents the complement of H (the attacker is not black).

We are given P(E|H) and P(H), but we are not given P(E|~H) or P(~H). However, the witness's error rate is given as 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time). Since the witness is correct half the time and incorrect half the time, P(E|~H) must also be 0.2.

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E): P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.41. This means that, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, we estimate that the attacker is black 41% of the time.
