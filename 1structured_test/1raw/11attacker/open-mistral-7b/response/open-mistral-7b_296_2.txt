Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this witness's ability applies to the specific attacker in question.

The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. But this does not necessarily mean that the attacker was more likely to be white. The witness's statement indicates that they may have mistakenly identified a white person as black.

Given this, it seems reasonable to assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is closer to the 20% error rate of the witness, rather than the 15% black population rate. However, without more specific information, we cannot provide a precise probability.

In dictionary format: {probability: uncertain, but likely closer to 0.2 than 0.15}
