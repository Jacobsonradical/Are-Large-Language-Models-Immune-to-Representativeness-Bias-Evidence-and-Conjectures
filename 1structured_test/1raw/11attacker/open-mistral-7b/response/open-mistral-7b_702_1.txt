To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider two factors: the racial demographics of the city and the reliability of the witness's race identification.

The attack occurred in a city where 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as black, is not always accurate. In conditions similar to the night of the attack, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(black). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). Given the racial demographics of the city, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white).

If the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black, we would mistakenly conclude that the attacker is black. So, the probability of this mistake is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness mistakes a white person as black 20% of the time, and there is a 85% chance that the attacker is white).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is P(black) = 1 - P(witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black).

So, P(black) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}
