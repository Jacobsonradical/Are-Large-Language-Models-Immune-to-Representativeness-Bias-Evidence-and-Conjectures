Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (as stated in the first piece of information), and the city's population is 85% white and 15% black (as stated in the second piece of information).

The witness's statement about the attacker's race should be weighed against their known error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identified a person's race 20% of the time, we can't assume that their identification of the attacker as black is 100% accurate.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be the product of the witness's correct identification rate and the proportion of the population that is black.

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%}

So, based on the witness's statement and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 12%. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and does not account for other factors that might influence the identification.
