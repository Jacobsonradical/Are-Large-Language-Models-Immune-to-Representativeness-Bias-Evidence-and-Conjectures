Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

However, we don't have any information about how often this witness makes mistakes identifying the attacker's race, specifically when the attacker is black. Therefore, without additional information, it's not possible to calculate the probability with certainty.

As a rough estimate, if we assume that the witness's error rate is the same for black and white people (which isn't necessarily true based on the given information), then the probability of the attacker being black would be the witness's success rate for identifying black people, which is 0.8.

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate for black people is the same as their overall error rate, which might not be the case. Without more specific information, a precise probability estimate cannot be made.

So, based on the information given, the probability of the attacker being black could be approximately 0.8, but this is a rough estimate and could be significantly different in reality.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on assumptions and could be significantly different in reality}
