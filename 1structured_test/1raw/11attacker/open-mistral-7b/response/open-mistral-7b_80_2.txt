Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the city's demographic data.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, if we assume that the attacker's race was white (the majority race in the city), there's a 20% chance that the witness would have mistakenly identified the attacker as black.

On the other hand, if the attacker was indeed black (the minority race in the city), then the witness would correctly identify them 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it's more likely that the attacker is white. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person times the probability of the attacker being black, plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person times the probability of the attacker being white.

So, we have:

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 (0.15) + 0.2 (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 or 29%.
