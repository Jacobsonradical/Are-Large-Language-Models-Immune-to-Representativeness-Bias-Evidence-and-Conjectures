To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's testimony and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, meaning they correctly identify it 80% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the event that the attacker is black, and B represents the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

P(A) = probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
P(B|A) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (given by the witness's reliability: 0.8)
P(B|~A) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given by the witness's error rate: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
P(~A) = probability that the attacker is not black (which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85)
P(B) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black (which is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

Simplifying and calculating, we find that P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.45.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 45%.
