Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race, which is 80% accurate for half white and half black people. However, the witness errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. This means that, even though the victim could not see the attacker's race, the witness saw the attacker and identified them as black.

We cannot directly use the city's demographics to estimate the attacker's race because the witness's identification is independent of the city's racial composition. Instead, we should use the witness's accuracy rate.

The witness's accuracy rate is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as black, so this means that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, as they identified them as black.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the same as the witness's accuracy rate in identifying black people. In this case, the probability is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.8}
