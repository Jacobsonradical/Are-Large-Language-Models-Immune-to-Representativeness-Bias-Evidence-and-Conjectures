To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the actual person is black, the witness correctly identifies them as black 80% of the time, and when the actual person is white, the witness mistakenly identifies them as black 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is P(black).

On the other hand, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate times the proportion of white people in the city).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the actual attacker is white is 1 - P(black). The probability that the witness made a mistake, mistaking a white person for a black one, is 0.17.

So, we can set up the equation:

P(black) * 0.8 + 0.17 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black)

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17) = 0.8 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.82

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.82 or 82%.
