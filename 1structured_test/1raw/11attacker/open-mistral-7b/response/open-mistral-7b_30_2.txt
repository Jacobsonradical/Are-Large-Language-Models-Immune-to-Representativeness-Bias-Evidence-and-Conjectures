Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect at identifying races, identified the attacker as black. This witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's reason through this:

- The witness's error rate of 20% means that 80% of the time, they correctly identify the race.
- Since the witness identified the attacker as black, one of two scenarios must have occurred:
  a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's race, and the attacker is indeed black.
  b) The witness made an error, misidentifying an attacker who is actually white as black.

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If the attacker is black (as the witness said), the probability is simply the percentage of black people in the city, which is 15%.
2. If the witness made an error, they incorrectly identified a white attacker as black. Since they make this error 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 20%.

However, if the witness made an error, the true attacker is actually white. In this scenario, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black in the future (given that the attacker is indeed white) is 0%, since the witness is always wrong when identifying a white person as black.

Since we are looking for the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, we can use the law of total probability:

P(Attacker is Black) = P(Attacker is Black and Witness is Correct) + P(Attacker is White and Witness is Incorrect) * P(Witness is Correct given Attacker is White)

However, the last term (P(Witness is Correct given Attacker is White)) is 0% as discussed above. Therefore, we can simplify the equation:

P(Attacker is Black) = P(Attacker is Black and Witness is Correct)

Now, we can calculate this probability using the given percentages:

P(Attacker is Black) = 15% (probability of a black attacker) * P(Witness is Correct given Attacker is Black)

We know that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time. So:

P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 12%. However, it should be noted that this estimate is based on certain assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability could be different in a real-world scenario.
