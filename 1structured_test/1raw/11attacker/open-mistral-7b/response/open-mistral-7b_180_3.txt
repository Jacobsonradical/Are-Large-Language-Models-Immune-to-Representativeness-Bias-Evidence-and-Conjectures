Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not perfect in judging race, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, with an equal number of white and black people in the sample.

Given this, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black. Let's denote the probability we are interested in as P(attacker is black).

First, let's consider the scenario where the attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as black with a probability of 0.2 (20% chance). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies him as black is 0.85 (85% probability of attacker being white) times 0.2 (20% chance of mistake).

Now, let's consider the scenario where the attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as black with a probability of 0.8 (80% chance). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies him as such is 0.15 (15% probability of attacker being black) times 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification).

The total probability of the witness's statement being true, regardless of whether the attacker is white or black, is the sum of these two probabilities. Therefore, P(attacker is black) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.39.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.39 or 39%.
