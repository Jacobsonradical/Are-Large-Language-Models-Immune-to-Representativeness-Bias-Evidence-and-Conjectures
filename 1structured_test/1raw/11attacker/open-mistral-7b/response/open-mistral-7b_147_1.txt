To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the city is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of a random person being white is 0.85 and the probability of a random person being black is 0.15.

If the witness is wrong, they will incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time (the error rate) and incorrectly identify a black person as white 20% of the time (also the error rate).

Since there are more white people in the city, the witness is more likely to make an error by identifying a white person as black than by identifying a black person as white. Let's calculate the probability of each error:

1. Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black: 0.85 (probability of a random person being white) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.17
2. Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white: 0.15 (probability of a random person being black) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.03

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as black. If they were wrong, they would have made either of the two errors we calculated above. Since the first error is more likely to happen, the probability that the attacker is white given the witness's statement is less than the probability of the first error:

1. Probability of attacker being white given witness's statement: 0.17 (probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black)

To find the probability of the attacker being black, we can subtract the probability of the attacker being white from 1:
