Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black, but their ability to accurately judge a person's race is only 80% accurate. This means that when they see a person who is actually white, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.

Given that we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can consider the witness's identification as a potential error. In other words, there's a chance that the attacker is actually white and the witness mistakenly identified them as black.

Let's calculate the probability of this error happening. Since the population is 85% white, if the attacker is white, there's a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as black. So, the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, since the population is also 15% black, if the attacker is black, there's no error, and the witness correctly identifies them as such.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is the probability of the attacker being black multiplied by the probability of correctly identifying them as black, plus the probability of the attacker being white given the witness's identification multiplied by the probability of making an error in identifying them as black.

This can be calculated as:

0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.32 or 32%. This means there's a slightly higher chance that the attacker is white, given the witness's identification, but with the population statistics, there's still a significant chance that the attacker is black.
