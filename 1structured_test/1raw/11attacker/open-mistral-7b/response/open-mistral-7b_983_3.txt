Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% with a 20% error rate. Since we don't have specific information about the attacker, we can assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error 20% of the time.

However, we do know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. If the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error, then it's likely that the attacker is actually white.

In this case, the error rate of identifying a white person as black would be the complementary probability of the witness's success rate, which is 20% (1 - 0.8 = 0.2).

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's incorrect identification is the error rate of identifying a white person as black, which is 0.2 or 20%.

However, this estimation assumes that the error rate of identifying a black person as white is the same. If the witness is more likely to err when identifying a black person as white, then the probability could be lower. Without more information, we can't make a more precise estimate.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
