To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is black
- q: the probability that the attacker is white (1 - p)
- W: the witness's accuracy in identifying race

Given the information, we have two equations:
1) W * p + (1 - W) * q = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time)
2) p + q = 0.15 (85% of the population is white)

We can solve these equations to find p.

First, let's find q:
q = 0.15 - p

Now, substitute q into the first equation:
W * p + (1 - W) (0.15 - p) = 0.8

Simplify the equation:
W * p + 0.15 - 0.15W - Wp = 0.8

Combine like terms:
(1 - W)p = 0.05

Divide both sides by (1 - W):
p = 0.05 / (1 - W)

Now, we need to know the value of W. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, W = 0.8.

Substitute W into the equation for p:
p = 0.05 / (1 - 0.8)
p = 0.05 / 0.2
p = 0.25

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.25 or 25%.
