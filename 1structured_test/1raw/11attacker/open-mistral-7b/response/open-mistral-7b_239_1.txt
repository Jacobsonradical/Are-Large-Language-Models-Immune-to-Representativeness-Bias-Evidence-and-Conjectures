Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the race 80% of the time and incorrectly identified it 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of a random attacker being black in the city)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability of any witness identifying a black attacker)

First, let's calculate P(H):
P(H) = 15% (since 15% of the population is black)

Next, we need to find P(E|H). Since the witness correctly identifies a black attacker 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.80.

Now, let's calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
Where ~H means not black (white in this case). Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.20. P(~H) is 1 - P(H) = 85%. So, P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.182

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.182 â‰ˆ 0.546

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence, is approximately 0.546 or 54.6%. This means there is a slightly higher probability that the attacker is black, but it's still not conclusive.
