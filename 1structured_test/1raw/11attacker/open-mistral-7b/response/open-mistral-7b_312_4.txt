To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the racial distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Given the witness's error rate and the racial distribution of the city, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 20% (error rate). Since 85% of the population is white, the number of white people the witness might mistake for black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (rounded to four decimal places).

The number of black people in the city is 15%.

Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identified a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (rounded to four decimal places).

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. The probability of this happening is 1 - the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white. Since the witness mistakes white people for black 17% of the time, the probability of a black person being mistakenly identified as white is 0.17.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (rounded to four decimal places).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.83.

Therefore, {probability: 0.83} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. This means there is an 83% chance the attacker is black based on the witness's identification and the city's racial demographics.
