The probability estimate for the attacker being black, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy rate in identifying race is only 80% when presented with a 50-50 mix of white and black people. This means they err 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't know the error rate of the witness when they misidentify a black person as white. We only know their overall error rate and the percentage of time they correctly identify a black person.
4. To make an estimate, we can assume that the witness's error rate when misidentifying a black person as white is the same as their overall error rate (20%). This is a conservative assumption, as it would tend to underestimate the probability that the attacker is black.
5. Given this assumption, and assuming that the attacker was indeed black, there is a 20% chance that the witness would err in their identification and mistakenly identify the attacker as white.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race plus the probability of the witness making an error and still identifying the attacker as black.
7. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%).
8. The probability of the witness making an error and still identifying the attacker as black is 0.2 (20%) * 0.8 (proportion of city population that is black) = 0.16 (16%).
9. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 + 0.16 = 0.96 (96%).

Answer: {probability: 0.96}
