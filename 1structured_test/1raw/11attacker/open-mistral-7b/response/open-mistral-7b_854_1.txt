To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker being white

Given the information in the text, we have:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, 15% black)
2. P(~H) = 0.85 (same as 1 - P(H))
3. P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified 80% of the time)
4. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability, we find:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1875

Therefore, given the witness's testimony, our updated estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 18.75%.
