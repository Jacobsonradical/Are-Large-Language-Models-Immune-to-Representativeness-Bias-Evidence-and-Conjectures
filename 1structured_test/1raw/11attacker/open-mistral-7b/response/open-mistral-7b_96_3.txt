Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race, which is 80% accurate, with a 20% error rate.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification of the attacker as black contradicts the initial information that the victim could not see the attacker's race. This inconsistency creates a challenging situation for making an accurate probability estimate.

Assuming that the witness's statement is true and ignoring the initial information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, A represents the attacker being black, and B represents the witness's statement that the attacker is black.

However, we only have enough information to calculate P(B|A) and P(A), but not P(B). Since we can't calculate P(B), we can't directly apply Bayes' theorem.

Given this limitation, I'm unable to provide a strictly numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is black based on the provided information. It would require more data or additional assumptions to make a more informed estimate.
