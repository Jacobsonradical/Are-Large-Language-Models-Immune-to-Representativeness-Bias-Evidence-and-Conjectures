Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the population distribution.

If the attacker is actually white, there is a 15% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as black (error rate of 20%). So, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakes them for black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (or 3%).

On the other hand, if the attacker is actually black, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify them as such. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identifies them is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Adding these two probabilities together gives us the total probability of the witness's identification: 0.03 (white and mistakenly identified) + 0.12 (black and correctly identified) = 0.15 (or 15%).

However, the witness identified the attacker as black, so we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification. Since the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black only 3% of the time, the probability that they are incorrect about the attacker's race is 3%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 (or 97%).

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.97}.
