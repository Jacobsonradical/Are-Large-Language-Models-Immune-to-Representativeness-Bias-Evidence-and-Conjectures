To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker's race is the same 20%, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 1 - the probability of error, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

However, this assumes that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is independent of the actual race of the person. Given that the city has a 85% white population and a 15% black population, we may need to adjust this probability.

The witness's error rate of 20% is calculated based on a sample where half the people are white and half are black. In the city, the chance of encountering a white person is 0.85 and a black person is 0.15. If the witness's error rate is not independent of the actual race, then the probability of the witness erring when encountering a black person may be different from the overall error rate of 20%.

Unfortunately, without more information about how the witness's error rate may vary based on the actual race, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is black. However, based on the given information, a reasonable estimate could be around 0.8, but with some uncertainty due to the potential dependence of the witness's error rate on the actual race.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this estimate is subject to uncertainty due to potential dependence of the witness's error rate on the actual race}
