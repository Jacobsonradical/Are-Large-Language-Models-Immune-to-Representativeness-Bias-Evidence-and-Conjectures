Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- B: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

From the information provided, we have two pieces of prior knowledge:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black in the city)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)

We also have the information about the witness's accuracy, which can be derived from the given information as P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.41) â‰ˆ 0.185

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18.5%.
