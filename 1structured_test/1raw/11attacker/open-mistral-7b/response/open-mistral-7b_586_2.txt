Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(B), and the probability of the attacker being white as P(W) = 1 - P(B).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be interpreted as having observed an event E, where E is the event of the attacker being black. The probability of this event is P(B).

However, the witness is not infallible, and they mistakenly identified a white person as black in 20% of their cases. This means the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is P(W) * 0.20.

Since the witness made a statement that the attacker is black, and they sometimes make mistakes, it is likely that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than the witness's statement. In other words, if we assume that the witness's statement "the attacker is black" corresponds to observing the event E, then the true probability P(B) is higher than the witness's stated probability.

To estimate P(B), we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem helps us find the conditional probability of an event given another event:

P(B | E) = [P(E | B) * P(B)] / [P(E | B) * P(B) + P(E | W) * P(W)]

In this case, we are looking for P(B | E), which is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness stated that the attacker is black.

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
- P(W) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being white)
- P(E | B) = 1 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E | W) = 0.20 (the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B | E) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.465

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.465 or 46.5%. This estimate is higher than the witness's statement because of the witness's error rate in identifying races.
