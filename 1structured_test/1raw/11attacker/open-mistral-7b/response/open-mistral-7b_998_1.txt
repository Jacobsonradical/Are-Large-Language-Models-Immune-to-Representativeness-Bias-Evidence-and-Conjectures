Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is typically 80% accurate in identifying race saw the attacker and identified them as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we can consider the witness's chance of making a correct identification (being black) and their chance of making an error (being white).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (attacker is black) is the probability of drawing a black person from the population times the witness's accuracy rate:

0.15 (probability of drawing a black person) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12

The probability of the witness making an error (attacker is white) is the probability of drawing a white person from the population times the witness's error rate (1 minus their accuracy rate):

0.85 (probability of drawing a white person) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

The total probability of the witness's identification being correct (attacker is black) or incorrect (attacker is white) is the sum of these two probabilities:

0.12 (probability of correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of error) = 0.29

However, since we are interested in the probability of the attacker being black, we need to consider the original probabilities of drawing a black or white person from the population and adjust the witness's probabilities accordingly:

0.15 (probability of drawing a black person) * 0.12 (probability of correct identification given a black person) + 0.85 (probability of drawing a white person) * 0.17 (probability of error given a white person)

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being black of:

0.0186 or approximately 1.86%

So, while the witness identified the attacker as black, the actual probability of the attacker being black, given the population statistics and the witness's accuracy, is quite low. It's important to consider this when evaluating the evidence.
