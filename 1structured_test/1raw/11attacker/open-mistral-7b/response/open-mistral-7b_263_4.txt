To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. The prior probability of event A (the attacker being black) is unknown, but we can estimate it using the population statistics. Since 15% of the population is black, this could be our prior probability.

The probability of event B given event A (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's accuracy at identifying race, which is 80%. The probability of event B given not event A (the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black) is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

The probability of event B (the witness's identification) is the sum of the probability of event B given event A and the probability of event B given not event A. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are only concerned with the probability of event B. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. Therefore, the probability of event B is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of event A given event B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions, including the accuracy of the witness's identification and the representativeness of the sample to the population.
