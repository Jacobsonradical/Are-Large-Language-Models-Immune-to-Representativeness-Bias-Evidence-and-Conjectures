Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to account for both the witness's error rate and the population distribution. We can do this by calculating the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black and then subtracting that from 1, because if the witness does not make an error, then the attacker must be black.

Let P(W) be the probability that the witness makes an error, and P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. We know that P(W) = 0.2 (error rate) and P(B) + P(W∩¬B) = 1 (total probability), where P(W∩¬B) is the probability that the witness errors and the attacker is not black.

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that the attacker is not black is P(¬B) = 0.85. Therefore, P(W∩¬B) = P(W) * P(¬B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can write the equation:

P(B) + P(W∩¬B) = 1
0.15 + P(W∩¬B) = 1
P(W∩¬B) = 0.85

So, P(B) = 1 - P(W∩¬B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

The probability that the attacker is black is 0.15 or 15%.
