Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race, but also makes errors 20% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
3. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, which means they made an error.
4. Given the error rate of 20%, the probability that the witness made this specific error (identifying a white person as black) is 20%.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the opposite of this probability, as the witness's statement represents an error: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 or 80%.
