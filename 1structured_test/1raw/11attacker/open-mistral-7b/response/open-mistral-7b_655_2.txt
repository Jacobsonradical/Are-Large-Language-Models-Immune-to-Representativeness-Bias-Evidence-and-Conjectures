To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying race and makes errors 20% of the time. However, we don't know whether the witness's error rate is biased towards underestimating or overestimating the proportion of black people.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identified the race. The probability of this is the witness's success rate for identifying black people, which is 0.8.
2. The attacker is white, and the witness made an error. The probability of this is the witness's error rate for identifying black people, which is 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to quantify the witness's error rate for identifying black people under conditions similar to the night of the attack. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.

In the absence of further information, it would be prudent to use the witness's overall success rate as an estimate. So, the probability that the attacker is black would be approximately 0.8. However, this estimate should be treated with caution due to the lack of information about the witness's error rate for identifying black people in low-light conditions.
