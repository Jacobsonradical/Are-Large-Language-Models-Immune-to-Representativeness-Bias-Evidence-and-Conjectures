Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any direct information about the attacker's race.

In this situation, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of event B given A times the prior probability of A.

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is black
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as black

We know the probability of B given A (P(B|A)) from the witness's ability: P(B|A) = 0.8
We know the probability of A given B (P(A|B)) from the population statistics: P(A|B) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)
We know the prior probability of A (P(A)): We don't have this information, but we can assume it's the same as the population proportion, so P(A) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can't calculate P(B) directly from the information, but we can rewrite it in terms of P(A|B) and P(A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we don't have enough information about P(B|not A) and P(not A), we can't calculate P(B) directly. Therefore, we can't directly calculate P(A|B) without making additional assumptions or having more information.

Since we can't provide a numerical estimate, our answer is: {probability: Unable to determine, please rerun with more information}
