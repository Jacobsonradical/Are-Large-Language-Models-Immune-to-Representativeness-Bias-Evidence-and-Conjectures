To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are distributed evenly between identifying whites as blacks and blacks as whites, then the witness correctly identifies a race 80% - 20% = 60% of the time.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black is therefore 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness correctly identifies a race 60% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is 0.15 * 0.6 = 0.09 (or 9%).

However, the witness has identified the attacker as black. This means that either the attacker is actually black or the witness has made a mistake by identifying a white person as black.

The probability of the first scenario is 0.09 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person 9% of the time). The probability of the second scenario is 0.17 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 17% of the time).

Since the witness has identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.09 + 0.17 = 0.26 (or 26%).

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.26}.
