Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the related conditions are the racial demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.

Bayes' theorem can be represented as:

P(A is black | witnessed as black) = [P(witnessed as black | A is black) * P(A is black)] / [P(witnessed as black | A is black) * P(A is black) + P(witnessed as black | A is not black) * P(A is not black)]

Let's break down the terms:

1. P(A is black) is the prior probability of an attacker being black in the city, which is given as 15%.
2. P(witnessed as black | A is black) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker as black, which is given as 80%.
3. P(witnessed as black | A is not black) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black attacker as black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(witnessed as black | A is not black) * P(A is not black) = 1 - (1 - 0.2) * 0.85 = 0.16
4. P(witnessed as black) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a non-black attacker, which is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.16 * 0.85 = 0.24

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A is black | witnessed as black):

P(A is black | witnessed as black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.16 * 0.85] = 0.24 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.585

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 58.5%.
