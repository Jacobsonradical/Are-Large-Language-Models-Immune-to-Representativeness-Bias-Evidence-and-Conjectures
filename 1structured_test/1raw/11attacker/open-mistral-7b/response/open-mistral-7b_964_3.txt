Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's perception of the attacker's race is a random event with these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of A, P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A, and P(B) is the prior probability of B.

In this case, A is the attacker being black, B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we want to find), P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (which is 0.8 from the information given), and P(B) is the prior probability of the witness's identification being "black" (which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker and incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.227.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.227

We can solve for P(A) by rearranging the equation:

P(A) = 0.227 * P(A|B) / 0.8

P(A) = 0.227 * 0.125 / 0.8

P(A) = 0.015625

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 1.56%. However, we should take into account that the city's population is 15% black, which seems much higher than our calculated probability. This suggests that the witness's identification may be unreliable, and the true probability of the attacker being black is likely closer to the city's population statistics. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker being black as 0.15 or 15%.
