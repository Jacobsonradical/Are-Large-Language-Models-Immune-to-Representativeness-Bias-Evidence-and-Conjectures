To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (0.15) in the information provided.

2. P(E | H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is indeed black. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as P(H) * P(E | H) + P(~H) * P(E | ~H), where ~H means not black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E | ~H) is 0.2. The total population is 100% white + 100% black = 200%, so P(~H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

4. To find P(E), we multiply the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (0.8) by the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15), and add this to the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (0.2) times the prior probability of the attacker not being black (0.85). P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
