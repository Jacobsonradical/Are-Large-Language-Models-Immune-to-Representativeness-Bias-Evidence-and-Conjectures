Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break it down:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black if the attacker is actually black. Since the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. This is given as 15% in the question: 0.15.

3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. Since half of the population is black and half is white, and the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a random person as black is [0.5 * 0.8] + [0.5 * 0.2] = 0.6.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.6
       â‰ˆ 0.1833

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18.33%.
