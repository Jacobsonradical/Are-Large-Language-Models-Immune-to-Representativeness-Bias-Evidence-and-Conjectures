Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we know is 15%), and let P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (given in the problem as 80%). Let P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the problem as 20%).

The probability of the witness making the observation B (identifying the attacker as black) is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and being correctly identified (P(B|A) \* P(A)) and the probability of the attacker being white and being incorrectly identified (P(B|~A) \* P(~A)), where P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white (which is 85%).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Using the given values, we can calculate P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is then P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Using the given values, we can calculate P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.242

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 24.2%.
