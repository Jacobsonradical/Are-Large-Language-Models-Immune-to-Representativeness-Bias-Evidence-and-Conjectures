Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being black as P(black). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually white is P(white) = 1 - P(black) = 0.17 / 0.2 = 0.85.

However, we know that the witness actually identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 0.8.

So, the probability of the attacker being black is {probability: 0.8}.
