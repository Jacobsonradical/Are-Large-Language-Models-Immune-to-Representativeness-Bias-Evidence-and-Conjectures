Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's break down the given information:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person, which is given as 0.8.
- P(A|B) is the probability we are trying to find, which is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black, which is given as 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, P(not A) is 0.15. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2 = 0.2 * 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.03
P(B) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15
P(A|B) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is approximately 12%. However, this is not the final answer, as we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, not given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Since the witness incorrectly identified a black person as non-black 20% of the time and a non-black person as black 15% of the time, the total error rate is 20% + 15% = 35%. This means that the witness correctly identified a person's race 65% of the time.

If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed among the population, then the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker's race should be the same as the overall error rate. That is, P(A|correctly identified) = 0.65.

Now, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(A|correctly identified) * P(correctly identified) + P(not A|correctly identified) * P(not A|correctly identified)
P(A) = 0.65 * 0.65 + 0.35 * 0.35
P(A) = 0.4225 + 0.1225
P(A) = 0.545

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 54.5%.
