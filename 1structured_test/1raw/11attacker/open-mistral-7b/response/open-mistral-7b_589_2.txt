Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%. Since the witness's identification is not always correct, we need to consider this error rate when estimating the attacker's race.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is actually black as P(black), and the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black as P(witness error). Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(witness error) = 0.20.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1) The attacker is truly black (P(black)), or
2) The witness made an error and the attacker is actually white (P(witness error)).

The probability that the witness made an error and identified a white person as black is P(witness error) * P(white) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (given that the population is 85% white).

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black in 80% of the cases, the probability that the attacker is truly black is 0.80 (the witness's correct rate) * (1 - P(witness error)) = 0.80 * (1 - 0.17) = 0.68.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.68}.
