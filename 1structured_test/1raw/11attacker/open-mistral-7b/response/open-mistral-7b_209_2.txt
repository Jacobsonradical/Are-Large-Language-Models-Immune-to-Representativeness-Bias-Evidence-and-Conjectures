Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The proportion of blacks in the city is 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which helps us calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, the events are:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker's race in this case)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.068, so the overall probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker is 0.12 + 0.068 = 0.188)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
        = [1 * 0.15] / 0.188
        â‰ˆ 0.805

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.805, or 80.5%.
