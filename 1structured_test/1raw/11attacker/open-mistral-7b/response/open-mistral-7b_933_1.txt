Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The general population distribution is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's assume there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually black. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race 80% of the time.
B) The attacker is actually white. In this case, the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time.

Given the population distribution, the probability of scenario A (the attacker is black) is 0.15 (15%).

We know that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time. This means that when the attacker is actually black (scenario A), the witness identifies the attacker correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is 0.8 (or 80%).

Similarly, the probability of scenario B (the attacker is white) is 0.85 (85%).

When the attacker is actually white (scenario B), the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as black 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both scenarios A and B and their respective probabilities. The overall probability that the attacker is black (given the witness's identification) is the sum of the probabilities of the attacker being black and the witness correctly identifying him, multiplied by this probability, and the probabilities of the attacker being white and the witness incorrectly identifying him, multiplied by this probability.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is:

(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
