Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% or 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 0.8)
- P(W|~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person 20% of the time, we can assume that they incorrectly identify a white person as black 20% of the time as well, so P(W|~B) = 0.2)
- P(~B) as the prior probability of the attacker being white (1 - P(B) = 0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
