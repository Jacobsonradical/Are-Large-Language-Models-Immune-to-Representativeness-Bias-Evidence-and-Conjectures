Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from the city's demographics), and the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8 (from their accuracy rate). The likelihood of the witness making an error is therefore 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

However, in this case we are only interested in the probability of the attacker being black, so we can ignore the denominator which represents the total probability of the evidence (E).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12}

So, the attacker has an estimated 12% chance of being black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics. This is lower than the 15% prior probability, indicating that the witness's identification may not be entirely reliable.
