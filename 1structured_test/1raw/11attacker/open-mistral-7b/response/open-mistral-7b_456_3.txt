To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We can break this down as follows:

1. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, this is 0.8.

2. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, this is 0.15.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, this is the sum of the probabilities of them being correct and erring, which is 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.77.

4. P(H|E) is what we're trying to find.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:
