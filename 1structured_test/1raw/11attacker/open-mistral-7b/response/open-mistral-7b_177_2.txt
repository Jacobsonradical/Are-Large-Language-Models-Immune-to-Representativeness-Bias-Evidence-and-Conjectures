Given the information provided, the attacker's race was initially unknown to the victim and was later identified as black by a witness with an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. However, we know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can take into account the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city. Let's assume that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as black. In this case, the actual attacker could be white.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness made an error in this case is 0.20. If the attacker is indeed white (which would mean the witness made an error), then the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 0.20.

According to the Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black (P(B)) given the witness's statement (W) can be calculated as:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

In this case:
- P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (0.15)
- P(W|B) is the likelihood of the witness stating that the attacker is black given that the attacker is black (1, since the witness was correct)
- P(W) is the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is black (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

P(W|~B) is the likelihood of the witness stating that the attacker is black given that the attacker is not black (which is the witness's error rate, 0.20). P(~B) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black (1 - P(B), or 0.85).

However, since we don't have the necessary information to calculate P(W), we can't directly find P(B|W). Instead, we can find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's error, which is P(B|W^c), where W^c is the complement of W (the event that the witness did not make an error).

The probability of the attacker being black given the witness did not make an error is:

P(B|W^c) = P(W^c|B) * P(B) / P(W^c)

P(W^c|B) is the likelihood of the witness not making an error given that the attacker is black (1 - 0.20, or 0.80). P(W^c) is the probability of the witness not making an error (P(W^c|B) * P(B) + P(W^c|~B) * P(~B)).

However, as before, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W^c). We can only estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement and error rate.

Given the witness's 80% accuracy rate, it is more likely that the attacker is black than white. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

{probability: approximately 0.80, but note that the exact probability cannot be calculated with the given information}
