To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(H|E)) can be calculated as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here's how we can use this formula:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume that the attacker could be either black or white, so P(H) = P(not H) = 0.5 (since the population is 50% black and 50% white).

2. P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black. This is given as 0.8 (80% correct).

3. P(H|E) is what we're trying to find: the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) and P(E|not H) * P(not H), which is 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.5] / 0.6 = 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4 or 40%.
