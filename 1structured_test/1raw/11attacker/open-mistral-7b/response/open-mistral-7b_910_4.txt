To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial distribution of the population.

The witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying race and errs 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, there is a 80% chance that the attacker is indeed black. However, if the witness identifies the attacker as black, there is also a 20% chance that the witness has made an error and the attacker is actually white.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the probability of a random person being black is 0.15 (15%). If the witness identifies a random person as black, there is a 0.8 (80%) chance that this person is actually black and a 0.2 (20%) chance that the witness has made an error.

However, the witness did not identify a random person, but rather the attacker. Since we do not know whether the witness's identification is correct or not, we need to consider both possibilities:

1. The witness is correct and the attacker is actually black. In this case, the probability is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
2. The witness is wrong and the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times 0.15 (the probability of a random person being black).

The overall probability of the attacker being black is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83}

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.83.
