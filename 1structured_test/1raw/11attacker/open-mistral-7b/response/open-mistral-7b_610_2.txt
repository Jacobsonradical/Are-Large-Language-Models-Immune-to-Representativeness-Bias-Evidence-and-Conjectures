Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness reported seeing the attacker as black. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time when the population was half white and half black, we can infer that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black in this case as well in a proportion equal to their error rate of 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given the witness's report, is 1 - the probability of the witness making the mistake they did. In other words, the probability that the attacker is white is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Therefore, {probability: 0.2} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
