To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is "the attacker is black" and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as black".

We have the following information:
- P(A) = 15%, the prior probability of the attacker being black
- P(B|A) = 80%, the probability the witness correctly identifies a black attacker
- P(B|~A) = 20%, the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker (~A means not A, i.e., the attacker is white)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 27.5%.
