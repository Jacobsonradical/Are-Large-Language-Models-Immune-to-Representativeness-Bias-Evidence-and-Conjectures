Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black with a probability of 80% when presented with a mix of white and black people.

The probability of the attacker being black in the population is 15%. However, we also know that the witness's ability to correctly identify race is only 80%. So, if the witness says the attacker is black, there's a 0.8 chance that they're correct.

To calculate the overall probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement, we multiply these probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%.
