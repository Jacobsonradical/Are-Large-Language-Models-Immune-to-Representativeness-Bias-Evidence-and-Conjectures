To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (in this case, the city's racial demographics) in the light of evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- R (Race) as the random variable representing the attacker's race (with two possible values: Black or White)
- W (Witness's statement) as the random variable representing the witness's statement (with two possible values: Black or Not Black)

From the information given, we have three pieces of data:
1. P(R=Black) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black, given the city's demographics)
2. P(R=White) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white, given the city's demographics)
3. P(W=Black | R=Black) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker)
4. P(W=Black | R=White) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is:

P(R=Black | W=Black) = P(W=Black | R=Black) * P(R=Black) / [P(W=Black | R=Black) * P(R=Black) + P(W=Black | R=White) * P(R=White)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(R=Black | W=Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.12 / 0.15

Simplifying, we get:

P(R=Black | W=Black) = 0.8 / 1.0 = 1

However, this result is not correct because the probability of an event cannot be 1. This situation indicates that the witness's statement is not independent of the attacker's race, meaning that the witness's ability to identify the attacker's race is not accurate enough to inform our belief about the attacker's race. In such cases, it is often more reasonable to rely on prior knowledge (in this case, the city's demographics) without taking the witness's statement into account.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the city's demographics, is:

{probability: 0.15}
