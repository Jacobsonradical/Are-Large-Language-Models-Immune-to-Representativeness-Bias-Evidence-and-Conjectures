To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a race 20% of the time (errs in favor of white people), and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. Since the witness reported the attacker as black, we need to factor in the possibility that the witness erred.

Let's assume that the witness erred in this case, meaning the attacker is actually white. In this case, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a white person as black is 20%.

Given that 85% of the city's population is white, the probability that the attacker is white, assuming the witness erred, is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, if the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, the attacker must be black. Since the witness correctly identifies a race 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is black, assuming the witness did not err, is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since we don't know whether the witness erred or not, we need to consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities. The probability that the witness erred is equal to the probability that the witness did not err, which is 0.5.

Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is black is 0.5 * 0.17 + 0.5 * 0.12 = 0.154 or 15.4%.

In summary, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.4%, considering the witness's reliability and the racial composition of the city.
