Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
3. However, the witness saw the attacker from behind and under poor lighting conditions, which could affect their ability to accurately identify the attacker's race.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't directly use their error rate of 20% in this case, but we can use it as a baseline for when they are more confident in their identification.
5. The witness's identification could be an error, but it's also possible that the attacker was indeed black.
6. To estimate the probability, we need to consider both the racial demographics and the witness's reliability.

Given these considerations, we cannot provide a precise probability without more information. However, we can make an educated guess based on the provided data.

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18, please note that this is an approximate estimate and not an exact probability}

This estimate suggests that there is a 18% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial demographics of the city. However, this is a rough estimate and may not accurately reflect the true probability, as it does not account for other factors that could influence the witness's ability to identify the attacker's race under the specific conditions of the attack.
