Based on the information provided, the population of the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not always accurate in identifying race identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this information, it's not straightforward to estimate the probability that the attacker is black without knowing the error rate of the witness when they incorrectly identify a white person as black. If the witness never makes this error, then the attacker must be black. If the witness makes this error as often as they make other errors, then the probability that the attacker is black is 15% (the population proportion).

Unfortunately, the provided information does not allow us to determine the exact probability. We would need more information about the witness's error rate in misidentifying white people as black to make a reliable estimate.
