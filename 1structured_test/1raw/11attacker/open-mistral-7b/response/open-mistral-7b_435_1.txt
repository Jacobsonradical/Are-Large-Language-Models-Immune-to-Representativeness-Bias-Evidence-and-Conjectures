Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (from (b), 15% of the population is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H represents not black)

We are not given the value of P(E|~H), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a non-black person. However, we know that P(E|~H) + P(E|H) = 1, and we have P(E|H), so we can find P(E|~H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.31

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
