Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

The population statistics give us a base probability of 15% that the attacker is black, as this is the proportion of the city's population that is black.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black is not necessarily accurate, as the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. Therefore, we need to account for this error rate.

The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so when the witness identifies someone as black, there is an 80% chance that they are correct. Since 15% of the population is black, this means that when the witness identifies someone as black, there is a 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 probability that they are actually black.

On the other hand, when the witness identifies someone as black, there is a 20% chance that they are making an error, and the actual race is different. Since 85% of the population is white, this means that when the witness identifies someone as black, there is a 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 probability that they are making an error and the actual race is white.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the sum of the probabilities that the witness was correct and that the witness was making an error, weighted by the consequences of each error. That is, the probability that the witness was correct multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually black, plus the probability that the witness was making an error multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually white.

So the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 * 1 + 0.17 * 0 = 0.12 + 0 = 0.12.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%.
