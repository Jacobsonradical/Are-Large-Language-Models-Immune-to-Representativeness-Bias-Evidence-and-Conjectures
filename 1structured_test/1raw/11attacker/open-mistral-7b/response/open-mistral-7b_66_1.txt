Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the 85% white and 15% black population distribution) based on the new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as black)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H):
The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H):
The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15%, so P(H) = 0.15

Now, we need to calculate P(E):
Since the witness was wrong 20% of the time, P(E) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.2 = 0.6

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 60%. This means there is a 60% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race and they are black, given the information provided.
