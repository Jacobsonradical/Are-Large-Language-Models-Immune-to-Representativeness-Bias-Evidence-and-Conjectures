To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to account for the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

1. We know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.
2. The witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. When the witness sees a person who is actually white, they mistakenly identify them as black 20% of the time.
4. When the witness sees a person who is actually black, they correctly identify them as black 80% of the time.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a black attacker:

P(Witness sees a black attacker and correctly identifies) = P(Black attacker) * P(Witness correctly identifies | Black attacker)
                                                                           = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                           = 0.12

Now let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black:

P(Witness sees a white attacker and incorrectly identifies) = P(White attacker) * P(Witness incorrectly identifies | White attacker)
                                                                                  = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                                  = 0.17

Since we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios (witness correctly identifying a black attacker and witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black), we need to add their probabilities to obtain the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black:

P(Witness identifies attacker as black) = P(Witness sees a black attacker and correctly identifies) + P(Witness sees a white attacker and incorrectly identifies)
                                                            = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                            = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
