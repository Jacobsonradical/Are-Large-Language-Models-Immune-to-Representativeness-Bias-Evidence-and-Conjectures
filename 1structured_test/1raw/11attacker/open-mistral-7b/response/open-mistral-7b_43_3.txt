Given the two pieces of information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

The first piece of information tells us that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, we should note that this information alone does not tell us anything about the race of the attacker, as the victim could not see the attacker's race.

The second piece of information tells us that a witness identified the attacker as black, but with some degree of error. Specifically, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we should also note that this information tells us nothing about the accuracy of the witness's identification in this specific case, as we do not know whether the witness is among the 80% who correctly identifies race or among the 20% who errs.

Given this uncertainty, the best we can do is to use the population statistics to make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, and then adjust that estimate based on the witness's error rate.

If we assume that the attacker is chosen at random from the population, then the probability that the attacker is black is 15%. However, if we take into account the witness's error rate, then we must also consider the possibility that the witness may have erroneously identified the attacker as black.

If the witness errs 20% of the time, then there is a 20% chance that the witness identified the attacker incorrectly as black. In that case, the true attacker could be white. However, we can't just subtract the 20% error rate from the 15% population rate, because the witness's error rate is not independent of the true population rate.

Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. We know the prior probability of event A (15%), and we know the conditional probability of event B given event A (100% since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black in this case, but we don't know that for sure). We also know the conditional probability of event B given not-event A (the witness's error rate of 20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of event A given event B as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not-A) \* P(not-A)]

However, we don't know whether the witness correctly identified the attacker as black (event B) or not (event not-A), so we can't calculate the exact value of P(B|A) or P(B|not-A). Instead, we can make an estimate based on the prior probability of event A (15%) and the error rate of the witness (20%).

Assuming that the witness is no more likely to err in one direction than the other (i.e., the error rate is symmetric around the true probability of 15%), we can estimate that P(B|not-A) is also 20%. Then, we can calculate the posterior probability as:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.15) / [(1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us a posterior probability of the attacker being black of approximately 0.155, or 15.5%.

Therefore, based on the information given, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 15.5%, taking into account the witness's error rate. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions and uncertainties, and it should be interpreted with caution.
