Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% when they have a 50-50 chance.
2. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the attacker's race is either white (W) or black (B). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(B | observation) = [P(observation | B) * P(B)] / [P(observation | B) * P(B) + P(observation | not B) * P(not B)]

In this case, we have:

1. P(observation | B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
2. P(B) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black)
3. P(observation | not B) = 0.8 (the witness errs 20% of the time, so when they think the person is not black, they are actually right 80% of the time)
4. P(not B) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being white)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B | observation) = (0.2 * 0.15) / ((0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85))
                             = 0.03 / 0.231
                             â‰ˆ 0.130

So, given the witness's observation and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.13, or 13%.
