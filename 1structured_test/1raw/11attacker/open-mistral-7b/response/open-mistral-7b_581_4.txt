Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial composition of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify a person's race, which is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate (erring).

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, so we cannot directly use the witness's identification as evidence. Instead, we can consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

The witness's error rate is 20%, meaning that they mistakenly identify a person as black 20% of the time they should have identified them as white. Given that 85% of the population is white, this means the witness will mistakenly identify a white person as black 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the time.

Given that 15% of the population is black, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, we are given that the witness did identify the attacker as black. This means that the actual probability of the attacker being black is higher than 12%. To find this probability, we can subtract the chance that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a white person as black.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}
