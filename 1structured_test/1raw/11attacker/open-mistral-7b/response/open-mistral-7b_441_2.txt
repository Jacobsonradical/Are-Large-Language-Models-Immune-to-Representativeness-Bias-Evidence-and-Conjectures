To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate. Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as 'p', and the probability of the attacker being white as '1-p'.

The witness identified the attacker as black, so we can set up an equation using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is black | identified as black) = P(identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(identified as black)

We are given that P(identified as black | attacker is black) = 0.8, P(attacker is black) = p, and we want to find P(identified as black).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, we can infer that P(identified as black | attacker is white) = 0.2. Then, the probability of being identified as black is:

P(identified as black) = P(identified as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(identified as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

P(identified as black) = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1-p)

Now we can rewrite the Bayes' theorem equation using this probability:

p = (0.8 * p) / (0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1-p))

Solving for 'p' gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black:
