To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is black before any evidence is considered)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a person as black)

We are given the following information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
- P(A) = ? (the probability that the attacker is black)
- P(B) = P(B|Black) * P(Black) + P(B|White) * P(White)
  P(B|Black) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black (given that the person is black), which we already know is 0.8
  P(Black) is the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to find)
  P(B|White) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black (given that the person is white), and we don't have this information. However, since the witness is more likely to identify a black person as black than a white person as black, we can assume that P(B|White) < P(B|Black)

Now, we can rewrite P(B) as:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(Black) + P(B|White) * (1 - P(Black))

We don't have enough information to calculate P(B|White), so we'll have to make an assumption or approximation. Let's assume that P(B|White) is half as likely as P(B|Black), which means P(B|White) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * P(Black) + 0.32 * (1 - P(Black))

Solving for P(Black) gives us:

P(Black) = (P(B) - 0.32) / 0.48

We are given that 85% of the population is white, which means 15% is black. So we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|Black) * P(Black) + P(B|White) * P(White)
   = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.32 * 0.85
   = 0.12 + 0.2768
   = 0.4

Now we can calculate P(Black):

P(Black) = (0.4 - 0.32) / 0.48
P(Black) = 0.08 / 0.48
P(Black) â‰ˆ 0.167

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.167 or 16.7%. This is lower than the 15% black population in the city, as the witness's identification is not perfect and has a 20% error rate.
