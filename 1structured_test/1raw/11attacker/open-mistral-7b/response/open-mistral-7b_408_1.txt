To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following information:
1. P(E | H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15)

However, we are not given P(E). To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)

Where ¬H is the complementary hypothesis (attacker is white). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(E | ¬H) = 0.2.

We are also given that 85% of the population is white, so P(¬H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
