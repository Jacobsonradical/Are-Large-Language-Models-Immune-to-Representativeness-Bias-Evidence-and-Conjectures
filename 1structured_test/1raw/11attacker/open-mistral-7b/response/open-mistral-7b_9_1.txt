Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the population composition is 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's observation and the city's demographics.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We also know that the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is the error rate of 20%. Let's denote that probability as P(witness misidentifies | attacker is white).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this being correct (P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black)) is the sum of the probability of the attacker being black and the probability of the attacker being white (which the witness misidentified):

P(attacker is black | witness identifies as black) = P(attacker is black) + P(attacker is white) * P(witness misidentifies | attacker is white)

We know P(attacker is black) = P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness identifies as black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white)

We also know P(witness identifies as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability) and P(attacker is white) = 0.85 (from the city's demographics). We can now solve for P(attacker is black):

P(attacker is black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.189 = 0.63 (approximately)

So, based on the witness's observation and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.63 or 63%.
