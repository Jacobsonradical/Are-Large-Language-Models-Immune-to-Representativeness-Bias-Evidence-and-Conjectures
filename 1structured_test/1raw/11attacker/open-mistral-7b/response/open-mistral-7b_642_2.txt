Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The population breakdown of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

However, we cannot directly use the population breakdown to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, because the witness's identification might be an error. Instead, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black, and then multiply that by the proportion of black people in the population.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness's identification being correct times the probability of the attacker being black.

Probability = Witness's accuracy rate * Proportion of black people
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 (or 12%). This is lower than the 15% proportion of black people in the city, suggesting that the witness may have mistakenly identified the attacker as black.
