To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness was found to correctly identify race 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as black. Since the majority of the population is white, it's more likely that the witness made an error in this case.

Let's denote:
- p: Probability that the attacker is black
- q: Probability that the attacker is white

We know that p + q = 1 (total probability) and that q = 0.85 (majority of the population is white).

Given a white person, the witness incorrectly identifies them as black 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white person is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given a black person, the witness incorrectly identifies them as white 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person is also 0.80.

Since the witness misidentified the attacker as black, we can set up the following probability equation:

0.20 * q + 0.80 * p = 1 (witness's error)

Given that q = 0.85, we can solve for p:

0.20 * 0.85 + 0.80 * p = 1
0.17 + 0.80 * p = 1
0.80 * p = 0.83
p = 0.83 / 0.80 â‰ˆ 0.10375

The estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 10.38%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is constant across all races, which might not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be treated with caution.

{probability: 0.10375, please note that this estimate has inherent uncertainty due to the assumptions made about the witness's error rate}
