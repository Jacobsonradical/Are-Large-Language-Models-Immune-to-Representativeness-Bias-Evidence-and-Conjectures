Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:

- P(B) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given by the population statistics: P(B) = 0.15)
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is black (provided in the question: P(W|B) = 0.8)
- P(W|not B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's race given that the attacker is not black (given by the witness's error rate: P(W|not B) = 0.2)
- P(not B) as the prior probability of the attacker not being black (given by the population statistics: P(not B) = 0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

Therefore, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the initial population statistics and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.
