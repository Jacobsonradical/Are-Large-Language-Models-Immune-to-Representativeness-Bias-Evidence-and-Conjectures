Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness with an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race and a 20% error rate.
2. The city's demographic information, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker being black. Let's denote this event as A (A is true if the attacker is black, and A is false if the attacker is white). The new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black. Let's denote this event as E (E is true if the witness identifies the attacker as black, and E is false if the witness identifies the attacker as white).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)], where:

1. P(A|E) is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. This is the probability we are trying to estimate.
2. P(E|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is equal to the witness's accuracy rate of 0.8.
3. P(A) is the prior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering any evidence. This is the city's demographic information, which is 0.15 (15%).
4. P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black given that the attacker is white. This is equal to the witness's error rate of 0.2.
5. P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is white before considering any evidence. This is the complement of P(A), which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 (or 12%). However, this estimate assumes the witness's accuracy and error rates remain the same under the specific conditions of the attack. If these conditions were different, the accuracy and error rates might be different as well, leading to a different estimate.
