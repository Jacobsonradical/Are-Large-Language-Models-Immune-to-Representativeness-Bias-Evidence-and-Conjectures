To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the city's racial demographics and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

Let's denote the true race of the attacker as R (either 'white' or 'black'). The city's demographics give us the prior probabilities of the attacker being white (W) or black (B):

P(W) = 0.85 (85%)
P(B) = 0.15 (15%)

Now, we know that the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. This means that:

P(identified as black | attacker is white) = 0.2 (error rate)
P(identified as black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (accuracy)

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up a Bayes' theorem problem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black:

P(B | identified as black) = [P(identified as black | B) * P(B)] / [P(identified as black | B) * P(B) + P(identified as black | W) * P(W)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(B | identified as black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(B | identified as black) â‰ˆ 0.225

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 22.5%.
