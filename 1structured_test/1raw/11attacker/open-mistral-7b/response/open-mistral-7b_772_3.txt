Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

The racial composition of the city suggests that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race suggests that they are incorrect 20% of the time. In this case, they identified the attacker as black, but we don't know if they were correct.

Given that we don't have any additional information about the actual race of the attacker, we can't make a definitive statement about their race. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we can estimate based on the racial composition of the city. Let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. Let P(A|B) be the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black. Finally, let P(B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which we can estimate based on the witness's reliability.

We have the following information:

* P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black)
* P(B|A) = 1 (the witness is always correct when the attacker is black)
* P(A|B) = ? (the probability we want to estimate)
* P(B) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

We can use Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is:
