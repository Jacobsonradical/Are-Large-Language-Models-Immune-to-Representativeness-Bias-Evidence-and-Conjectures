Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and makes errors 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness's statement is an observation, and we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given this observation.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we have two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race.
2. The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race.

We know the probability of the first scenario is 0.8 (80%). In this case, the attacker is indeed black.

The probability of the second scenario is 0.2 (20%). In this case, the attacker is actually white, but the witness erroneously identified them as black.

However, since we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios based on the given information, we must treat both scenarios equally likely when estimating the probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios.

probability = 0.8 (witness correctly identified attacker as black) + 0.2 (witness erroneously identified attacker as black)

probability = 0.8 + 0.2

probability = 1.0

However, the probability should be between 0 and 1. This contradiction suggests that the witness's statement cannot be used to estimate the probability of the attacker's race accurately, given the provided demographic information.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a valid probability estimate.
