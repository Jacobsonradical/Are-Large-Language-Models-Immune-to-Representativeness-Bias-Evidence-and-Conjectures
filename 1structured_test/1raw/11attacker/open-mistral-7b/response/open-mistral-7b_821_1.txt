Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: The attacker is black
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15
- P(W|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is black. This is given as 80% or 0.8
- P(W|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person, given that the attacker is not black. Since the attacker is assumed to be white in this case, and the witness errs 20% of the time, P(W|~A) = 0.2
- P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker not being black, which is given as 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(~W|A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as not black, given that the attacker is black. Since this is not provided, we'll assume that P(W|A) = P(~W|A) for simplicity, which is not necessarily accurate but simplifies the calculation.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.216 or 21.6%

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 21.6%. However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions, and the actual probability might be different.
