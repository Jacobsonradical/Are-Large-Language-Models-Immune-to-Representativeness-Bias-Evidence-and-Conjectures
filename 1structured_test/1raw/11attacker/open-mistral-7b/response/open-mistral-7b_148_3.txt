To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness was correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means that when the witness was wrong, they erroneously labeled someone as black. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the witness was mistaken about a white person is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's mistake, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification may not be entirely reliable, especially given that the attack happened in low light conditions. Therefore, it's a good idea to consider other evidence or information to get a more accurate estimate.
