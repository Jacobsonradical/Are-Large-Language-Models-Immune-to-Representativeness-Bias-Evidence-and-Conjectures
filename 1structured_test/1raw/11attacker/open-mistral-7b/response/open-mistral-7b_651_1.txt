Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness, who is not perfect in identifying people's races, has identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a white person as black or a black person as white. This assumption is to ensure that the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is white is equal to the probability of the witness's statement being true given that the attacker is black.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (given that the attacker is black) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error (given that the attacker is black) is 0.2.

Since the witness errs equally in both directions, the probability of the witness making a correct identification (given that the attacker is white) is also 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error (given that the attacker is white) is also 0.2.

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is black, divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is black, and the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is white.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is (0.8 / (0.8 + 0.8)) = 0.5 or 50%.

Here's the answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.5}
