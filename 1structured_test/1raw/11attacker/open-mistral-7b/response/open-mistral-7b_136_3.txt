To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to know if the witness's mistake was more likely to result in misidentifying a white person as black or vice versa. Let's assume, for simplicity, that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two races.

The witness saw the attacker at night, which might have made it harder to accurately identify the race. Therefore, we might want to adjust the 80% rate downwards to account for this difficulty. However, without more specific information, we can't do this accurately.

Given these considerations, a strict answer to your question would be:

{probability: an estimate cannot be provided with the given information}

However, if we assume that the witness's race identification was not significantly affected by the poor lighting, we could use the 80% rate as an estimate. In this case, the attacker being black would be the more likely outcome, given the city's racial demographics.

{probability: 0.85 (85%), assuming the witness's identification was not significantly affected by the poor lighting}

Again, this is a rough estimate and might not accurately reflect the true probability, as it does not account for potential biases in the witness's race identification or the effects of poor lighting.
