Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the racial composition of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the city's racial composition and the attacker's race. The witness did not see the attacker's race directly, but rather identified the attacker as black based on their observation. The witness's accuracy rate is given under controlled conditions, but the night attack scenario might introduce additional uncertainties.

Given this, we can't directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the attacker's race, as the witness might have erred in this specific case. The witness's race judgment ability is a separate piece of information and does not necessarily reflect the attacker's race.

Therefore, the most conservative estimate would be to use the population distribution as our best guess. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be 0.15 (15%). This is based on the assumption that the witness may have erred in their identification.

In summary, {probability: 0.15} is the best estimate given the available information.
