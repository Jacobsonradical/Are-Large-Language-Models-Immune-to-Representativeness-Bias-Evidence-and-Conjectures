Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, with 85% white and 15% black population.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

The witness's identification of the attacker as black does not necessarily mean the attacker is actually black. We need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error is 20%. This means there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct.

However, we also need to consider the racial demographics of the city. If the attacker is white, the witness would still identify them as black 20% of the time due to the error rate. So, the probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistakenly identifies them as black is 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white) * 0.20 (probability of a mistake).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.80 (probability of correct identification), minus the probability of a mistake in identifying a white person, which is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.80 - 0.17 = 0.63 or 63%.
