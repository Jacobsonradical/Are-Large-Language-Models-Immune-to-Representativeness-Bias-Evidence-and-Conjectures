Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city (85% white and 15% black) and the witness's ability to accurately identify race (correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time).

However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate is based on a scenario where the person was seen under ideal conditions (half white and half black sample). In the actual attack scenario, the witness could not see the attacker's race at all, which means the witness would not contribute any information to our estimate.

Therefore, the best estimate we can make based on the available information is still the racial composition of the city, which is 85% chance the attacker is white and 15% chance the attacker is black.
