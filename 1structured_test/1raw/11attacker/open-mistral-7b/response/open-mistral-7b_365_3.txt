Given the information provided, we have two probabilities to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, there's an important distinction to make between these two probabilities. The first probability (85% white, 15% black) represents the true racial composition of the city. The second probability (80% correct, 20% incorrect) represents the witness's ability to accurately identify race, which may not necessarily reflect the actual racial composition.

The witness's errors could potentially skew the reported racial identity of the attacker. If the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black, this would increase the perceived number of black attackers in the data.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to take into account both the true racial distribution and the witness's error rate. Unfortunately, without more specific information about how the witness's errors affect the reported racial identity of the attacker, it's not possible to provide a precise probability.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the information given. If the witness's errors are random and do not systematically favor one race over the other, then the reported racial identity of the attacker (black) might still be an accurate reflection of the true racial composition. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black would be close to 15%, the true racial distribution in the city.

On the other hand, if the witness's errors systematically favor one race over the other, then the reported racial identity of the attacker might not be a reliable estimate of the true racial composition. In this case, the probability that the attacker is black could be higher or lower than 15%.

Without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a more precise estimate. Therefore, the best answer I can give you is:

{probability: approximately 15%, with the caveat that this estimate could be higher or lower depending on the witness's error pattern}
