To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can assume that the witness's observation is an error in 20% of the cases.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If the witness's observation is an error, it means they've mistakenly identified a white person as black. Since there are more white people in the city, the probability of this error happening is higher for white people.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). The probability of the witness's observation being an error, which means the attacker is white, is P(white) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate).

Given that 85% of the population is white, we can calculate P(white) as follows:

P(white) = Number of white people the witness mistakenly identifies as black / Total number of people

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the number of white people the witness mistakenly identifies as black is 0.2 * Total number of white people.

So, P(white) = (0.2 * Number of white people) / (Number of white people + Number of black people)

Since the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, we can write this as:

P(white) = (0.2 * 0.85 * Total population) / (0.85 * Total population + 0.15 * Total population)

Simplifying, we get:

P(white) = 0.17

Since P(white) is the probability of the witness's observation being an error, which means the attacker is white, we can find P(black) by subtracting this from 1:

P(black) = 1 - P(white)

P(black) = 1 - 0.17

P(black) = 0.83

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.83 or 83%.
