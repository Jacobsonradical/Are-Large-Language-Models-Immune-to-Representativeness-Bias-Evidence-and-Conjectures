The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can treat this as a success for the witness. The total population in the city is 100% divided equally between whites and blacks, so the prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.5 (50%).

Given an attacker's race being black (success), the probability of the witness correctly identifying this is 0.8 (from information b). So, the likelihood of the event given the hypothesis (Bayes' theorem) is:

P(attacker is black | witnessed as black) = P(witnessed as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witnessed as black)

The probability of the witness identifying the race correctly (given the attacker's race is black) is 0.8. The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.5. To calculate the probability of the witness identifying the race as black, we can use the witness's overall accuracy rate:

P(witnessed as black) = P(attacker is black) * P(witnessed as black | attacker is black) + P(attacker is not black) * P(witnessed as black | attacker is not black)

Given that P(attacker is not black) = 0.5 and P(witnessed as black | attacker is not black) = 0.2 (from information b), we can calculate P(witnessed as black):

P(witnessed as black) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.4

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(attacker is black | witnessed as black) = P(witnessed as black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witnessed as black) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.4 â‰ˆ 0.88

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.88.
