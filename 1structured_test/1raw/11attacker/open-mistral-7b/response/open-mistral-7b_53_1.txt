Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness identified the attacker as black with a 80% accuracy rate. Since the witness also made 20% errors in their race judgments, it means that they incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time.

Given that the attacker was not seen clearly, there's a chance that the witness could have mistakenly identified a white person as black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is actually white, despite the witness's identification, would be equal to the error rate of the witness.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - the probability that the attacker is white.

The probability that the attacker is white is the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a white person as black. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.2 (or 20%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%).

{probability: 0.8}
