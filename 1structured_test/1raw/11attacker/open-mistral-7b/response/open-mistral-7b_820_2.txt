Given the information provided, the probability estimate of the attacker being black can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, a witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, identified the attacker as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness erred in the identification, there's a chance that the actual attacker might be white. So, we need to calculate the probability of this error happening.
4. The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is actually white is 20% (error rate).
5. However, since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is also 85%.
6. So, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a white attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).
7. This means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).
8. Since the attacker is actually black according to the witness, we can consider this as a successful identification.
9. Therefore, the probability estimate of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is 0.83 (83%).
