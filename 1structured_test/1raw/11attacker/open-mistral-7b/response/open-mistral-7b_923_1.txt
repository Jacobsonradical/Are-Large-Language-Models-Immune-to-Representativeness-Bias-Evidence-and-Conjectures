To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. H: The attacker is black
2. E: The witness identified the attacker as black

We have the following information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (complementary probability of P(H))

To calculate P(E), we use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

After calculating the probabilities and plugging them into the formula, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
