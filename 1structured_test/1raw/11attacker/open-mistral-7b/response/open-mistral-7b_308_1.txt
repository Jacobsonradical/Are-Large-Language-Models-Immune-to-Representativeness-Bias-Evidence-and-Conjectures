Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

1. The racial demographics of the city, which we know to be 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's race themselves, we will rely on the witness's identification. However, we must take into account the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as P(Black), and the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black as Q.

From the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we know that P(Black) + Q = 0.8 (80%).

From the racial demographics of the city, we know that P(Black) = 0.15 (15%).

We can now substitute the second equation into the first to solve for Q:

0.15 + Q = 0.8
Q = 0.65

So, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 0.65 or 65%.

Now, let's consider the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 65% of the time, we can calculate this probability as:

P(Black | Witness's Identification) = P(Black) / (P(Black) + Q)
P(Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.65)
P(Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.15 / 0.8
P(Black | Witness's Identification) = 0.1875

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's observed ability to identify race, which may not perfectly reflect their actual ability. Real-world conditions, such as lighting, distance, and the witness's level of certainty, could influence their performance.

In summary, given the information provided, our strict estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, based on the witness's identification, is 0.1875 or 18.75%.
