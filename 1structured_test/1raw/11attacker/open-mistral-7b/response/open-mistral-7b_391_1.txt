Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial composition of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying races.

1. The racial composition of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness, in a similar situation, correctly identified race 80% of the time and erroneously identified it 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is black because we do not know if the witness's identification was correct or not.

To estimate the probability, we need to consider both the racial composition of the city and the witness's error rate. Let's assume the witness's identification was incorrect. Then, the attacker must be white. In this case, the probability of the witness's mistake given that the attacker is white is 20%, as mentioned in the second piece of information.

On the other hand, if the witness's identification was correct, the attacker is indeed black. In this case, we know that the attacker is black with certainty (100% probability), as stated by the witness.

However, we cannot know if the witness's identification was correct or not. Therefore, we need to weigh the two scenarios to estimate the overall probability that the attacker is black.

The probability that the witness's identification was incorrect is equal to the probability that the attacker is white. Since the city is 85% white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20% when identifying whites, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

So, the probability that the witness's identification was correct and the attacker is black is 100% - 17% = 83%.

Since we cannot know if the witness's identification was correct or not, we should take the average of the two scenarios to estimate the overall probability that the attacker is black.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is the average of the two probabilities: 0.17 (when the witness's identification is incorrect) and 0.83 (when the witness's identification is correct).
