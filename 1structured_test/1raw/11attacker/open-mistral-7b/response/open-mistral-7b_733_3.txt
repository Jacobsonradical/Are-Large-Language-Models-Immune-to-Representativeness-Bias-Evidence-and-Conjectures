To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness's racial identification is reliable 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's race (probability of this event is 0.80, derived from the witness's reliability rate).
2. The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race (probability of this event is 0.20, derived from the witness's error rate).

Given that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the impact of the witness's identification on these probabilities:

If the witness correctly identified the attacker's race:
- The probability that the attacker is black remains 0.15 (since the witness's identification does not change the actual race of the attacker).
- The probability that the attacker is white decreases from 0.85 to (1 - 0.15) = 0.85 * 0.90 = 0.765 (since the witness's identification makes it less likely that the attacker is white).

If the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's race:
- The probability that the attacker is black decreases from 0.15 to (0.15 * 0.20) = 0.03 (since the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black).
- The probability that the attacker is white increases from 0.85 to (0.85 * 0.80) = 0.68 (since the witness mistakenly identified a black person as white).

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that the attacker is black, considering both scenarios:

Probability that the attacker is black = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.03 = 0.12 + 0.006 = 0.126

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.126 or 12.6%.
