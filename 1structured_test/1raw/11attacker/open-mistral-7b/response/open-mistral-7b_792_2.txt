Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to judge race is 80% accurate, identified the attacker as black.

However, we don't have information about the accuracy of the witness's identification in this specific case. We only know the witness's general accuracy in a controlled environment.

Therefore, without more information, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the witness's identification.

So, the answer is:
{probability: unable to provide a number}
