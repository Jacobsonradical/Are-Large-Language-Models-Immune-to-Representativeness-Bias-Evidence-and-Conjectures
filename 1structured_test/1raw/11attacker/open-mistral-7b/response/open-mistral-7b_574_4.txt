To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness might have erroneously identified the attacker as black. In this case, the probability that the attacker is white given the witness's identification is the error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Given that the city's population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability that an attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population is also 0.15 (or 15%).

Since we cannot distinguish between the two scenarios (correct identification or error) based on the information given, we should weight both probabilities by their likelihoods. The total probability of the attacker being black is then the sum of the probability of correct identification times the probability of being black given correct identification, and the probability of error times the probability of being black given error:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.29 (or 29%).
