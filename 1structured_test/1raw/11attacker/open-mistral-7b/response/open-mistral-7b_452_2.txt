Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

1. Population statistics: We know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

2. Witness reliability: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we cannot determine the attacker's race directly, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

Let:
- P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W|B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black
- P(W|~B) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black
- P(~B) be the probability that the attacker is not black

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)]

Given the information we have, we can calculate the following probabilities:

- P(B) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(~B) = 0.85 (from the population statistics)
- P(W|B) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability)
- P(W|~B) = 0 (since the witness never incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Now, we can calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85]
            = 0.12 / 0.12
            = 1

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the given information. The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification should be less than 1, as there is some degree of uncertainty or error in the witness's identification.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strictly numerical answer based on the given information, as it appears to contain an inconsistency. It would be beneficial to have more reliable data or clarify some aspects of the information provided to make an accurate estimation.
