To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the racial distribution in the population is the same as the sample the witness was tested on (half white and half black), then the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. This means that the probability of randomly encountering a black person in the city is 0.15 (or 15%).

Given that the witness's statement about the attacker's race is likely a result of their racial identification error, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black by multiplying the probability that the witness makes an error with the probability of encountering a black person.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.2 (or 20%) * 0.15 (or 15%), which equals 0.03 (or 3%).

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for all races and that the racial distribution in the population is the same as the sample the witness was tested on. In reality, these assumptions may not hold true, and the actual probability could be different.
