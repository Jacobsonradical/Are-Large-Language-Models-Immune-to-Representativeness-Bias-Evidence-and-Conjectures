Based on the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider: the demographics of the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify race.

1. Demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

2. Witness's ability to accurately identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness seemed to have an error bias towards identifying people as black (erring 20% of the time).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black.

We know P(A) = 0.15 (15% black population), P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time), and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85.

Solving for P(A|B) gives us:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is approximately 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is conditional on the witness's error bias towards identifying people as black. Without knowing the true error rate, the probability could be higher or lower.
