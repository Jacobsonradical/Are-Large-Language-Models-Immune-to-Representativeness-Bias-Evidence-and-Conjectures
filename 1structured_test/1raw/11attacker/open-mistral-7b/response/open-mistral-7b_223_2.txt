To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

Let's denote the actual probability that the attacker is black as p. The witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white with a probability of 0.20, and correctly identifies a black person as black with a probability of 0.80.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = P(witness says black and attacker is black) / P(witness says black)

P(witness says black and attacker is black) = p * 0.80 (since the witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
P(witness says black) = p * 0.80 + (1-p) * 0.20 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

So,

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (p * 0.80) / (p * 0.80 + (1-p) * 0.20)

Now, we know that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. So, p = 0.15 (since the attacker's race cannot be determined from the information given).

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.15 * 0.80) / (0.15 * 0.80 + (1-0.15) * 0.20)

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.71 or 71%.
