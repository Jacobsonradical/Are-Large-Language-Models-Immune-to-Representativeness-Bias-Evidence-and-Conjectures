Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The overall population distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect at identifying races, correctly identifies races 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed black.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be true in two cases:

a) The attacker is actually black.
b) The witness erroneously identified a white person as black.

We know that the probability of the witness making an error is 20%. So, the probability of case b) is 0.2 (or 20%).

However, the witness's statement also could be false if the attacker is white. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's race, which happens only 20% of the time (given the witness's error rate).

So, the probability of case a) being false is 0.2.

Since these two cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (they cover all possibilities), we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black by summing the probabilities of both cases being true and both cases being false:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black and witness statement is true) + P(attacker is black and witness statement is false)

= P(attacker is black) * P(witness statement is true given attacker is black) + P(attacker is black) * P(witness statement is false given attacker is black)

= P(attacker is black) * 1 * 0.8 + P(attacker is black) * 0.2

We're given that the overall population distribution of the city is 85% white and 15% black. So, the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15.

Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

0.15 * 1 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

However, we made an error in our original calculation. The probability of the witness statement being true given that the attacker is black is not 1, but rather the witness's accuracy rate of 0.8. So the corrected equation is:

P(attacker is black) = P(attacker is black) * 0.8 + P(attacker is black) * 0.2

= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2

= 0.12 + 0.03

= 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.15, or 15%.
