Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies black people 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is black)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
  Here, ~H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is not black (i.e., the attacker is white)
  We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|~H) directly, but we can use the fact that P(E|H) + P(E|~H) = 1, and that P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
             = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
             â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
