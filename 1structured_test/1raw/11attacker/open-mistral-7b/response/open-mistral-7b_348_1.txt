To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case, H is the event that the attacker is black, and E is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

From the information given, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% white, so 15% black)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying race 20% of the time, where ~H means the attacker is not black)

We don't have information about P(E), but we can rewrite Bayes' theorem to express P(H|E) in terms of P(E|H), P(H), and P(E|~H):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We know P(E|~H) = 0.2, but we don't have a value for P(~H). However, since P(H) + P(~H) = 1, we can express P(~H) as 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.154 = 0.78 (rounded to three decimal places)

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.78 or 78%.
