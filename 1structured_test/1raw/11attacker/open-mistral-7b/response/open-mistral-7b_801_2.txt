Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is an estimate based on both the racial composition of the city and the witness's reliability in identifying race.

The city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, we must also consider the witness's reliability in identifying race. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't be sure if this was a correct identification or an error.

Therefore, we can't directly use the city's racial composition as the probability of the attacker being black, but we can use it to calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification if the attacker was indeed black.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is black is the witness's reliability in identifying race, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

Since we don't know if the witness's identification was correct or not, we can consider the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually white. In that case, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white if the witness made an error is 0.85.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness making a correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness made a correct identification, plus the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness made an error, multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error:

0.8 * (probability of attacker being black given witness's correct identification) + 0.2 * (probability of attacker being white given witness's error)

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness made a correct identification or the probability of the attacker being white given that the witness made an error. Therefore, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate in the dictionary format you requested.

However, based on the information given, it seems more likely that the attacker is white, given that a larger percentage of the population is white and the witness's reliability in identifying race is not perfect. But without more information, this is just an informed guess, not a probability estimate.
