To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem is written as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (also known as the likelihood).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

The prior probability P(H) is the probability of the attacker being black in the population, which we can estimate using the city's demographics. From the information provided, 15% of the population is black, so P(H) = 0.15.

The likelihood P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 in the information.

The probability P(E) is the probability of the witness making this identification, regardless of the attacker's race. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E|~H) (the probability of making this identification given that the attacker is not black) is 0.2. Therefore, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22.

Now we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.636

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.636 or 63.6%.
