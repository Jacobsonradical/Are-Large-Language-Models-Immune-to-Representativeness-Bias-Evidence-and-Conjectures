Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- E: The witness's statement

We know the prior probability of H, which is the probability of the attacker being black before any evidence is given. This is given by the population statistics:
P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black)

We also know the likelihood of E given H, which is the probability that the witness makes the statement "the attacker is black" if the attacker is indeed black. This is given by the witness's accuracy:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)

Similarly, we know the likelihood of E given not-H, which is the probability that the witness makes the statement "the witness is black" if the attacker is not black. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate this as follows:
P(E|not-H) = P(not-H) * P(E|not-H and not-H)

P(not-H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is white)
P(E|not-H and not-H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)

So, P(E|not-H) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, to find the posterior probability of H given E, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Plugging in the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
