To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is black
- P(B) as the prior probability that the witness identifies a person as black

We are given the values of P(B|A) (80%) and P(B) (85% white, 15% black), which means P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 20%.

However, we are missing the value of P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is black. To estimate this, we can use the given population data in the city: P(A) = 0.15 (15% black).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.16

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the evidence of the witness's identification, is approximately 16%.
