Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given some evidence B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is given as 80%.
3. P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B|A) * P(not A|B) = 1 - (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.
4. P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
5. P(B) is the probability of the witness making an identification, which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85 = 0.122.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.122 â‰ˆ 0.65

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.65 or 65%.
