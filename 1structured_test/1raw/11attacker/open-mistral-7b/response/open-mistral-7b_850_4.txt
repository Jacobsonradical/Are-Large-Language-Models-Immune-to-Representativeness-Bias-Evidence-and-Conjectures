Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is black
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given two pieces of prior information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is black)
- P(E|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black)

We are also given a piece of new evidence:
- P(~A|E) = P(E|~A) / P(E|A) + P(E|~A) = 0.2 / 0.8 + 0.2 = 0.3 (the probability that the witness was wrong given that the attacker is not black)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.18

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.18 or 18%.
