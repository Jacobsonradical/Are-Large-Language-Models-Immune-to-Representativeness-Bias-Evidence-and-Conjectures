To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to determine the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and observed evidence.

In this case, the event we are interested in is the attacker's race. The prior knowledge is the racial distribution in the city, and the observed evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(Black) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(White) as the probability that the attacker is white
- P(Witness says Black | Black) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- P(Witness says Black | White) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a white person as black

We are given that P(Black) = 0.15 (from information b) and P(Witness says Black) = 0.8 (from information a). We also know that P(Witness says Black | Black) + P(Witness says Black | White) = 1 (since the witness is either correct or mistaken).

However, we do not have sufficient information to calculate P(Witness says Black | White). To make an estimate, we can assume that the witness is equally likely to mistake a white person for a black person as they are to mistake a black person for a white person (symmetry argument). This means P(Witness says Black | White) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black) / [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness says Black | White) * P(White)]

Substituting the given values and our assumption, we get:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
