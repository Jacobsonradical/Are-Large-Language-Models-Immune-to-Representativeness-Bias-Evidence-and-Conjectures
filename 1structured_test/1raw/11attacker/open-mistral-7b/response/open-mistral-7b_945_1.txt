Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have enough information about the witness's encounter with the attacker to apply these probabilities directly. The witness's accuracy rate of 80% is based on a sample of people that was "half white and half black." But we don't know if the attacker was in this type of racially balanced population or not.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. This is a complex probability problem that would require additional context or assumptions about the witness's encounter with the attacker to solve accurately.
