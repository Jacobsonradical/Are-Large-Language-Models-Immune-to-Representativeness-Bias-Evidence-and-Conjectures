To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. According to the population distribution (information "a"), 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black.

2. However, the witness's reliability in identifying race is lower than the population distribution. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (information "b").

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can't be 100% sure that the attacker is actually black because of the 20% error rate. But we can calculate the probability of this error occurring, which would mean the attacker is actually white.

Let's assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is "p". Then, the probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is black when the attacker is actually white is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate * 85% white population).

So, the probability that the attacker is actually white, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 0.17. Since the sum of probabilities should equal 1, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified the attacker as black, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

Therefore, {probability: 0.83} is our estimate. This means we estimate that there is an 83% chance that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
