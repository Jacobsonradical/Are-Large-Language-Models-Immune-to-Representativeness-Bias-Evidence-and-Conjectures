Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's description of the attacker as black conflicts with the information that 85% of the population is white. This seeming contradiction suggests that the witness may have made an error in their identification.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, we can estimate that there's a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's race. This means there's an 80% chance that the witness's identification is correct.

However, since the witness's correct identification rate is lower than the actual racial demographics of the city, it's reasonable to assume that the witness may have made an error in this case as well.

Taking both pieces of information into account, it seems more likely that the witness made an error in their identification, given the higher percentage of white individuals in the city. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's description, would be lower than the actual racial demographics of the city.

However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability. A more thorough investigation, including additional witness statements or physical evidence, would be needed to make a more accurate estimation.

{probability: less than 15%, but a precise number cannot be determined with the given information}
