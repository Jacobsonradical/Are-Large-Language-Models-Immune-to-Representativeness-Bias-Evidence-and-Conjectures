Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case:
- H is the event that the attacker is black
- E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 1 (since the attacker is black, the witness's identification is 100% correct in this case)
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being black in the population)
- P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (probability of the witness's identification being correct, given any attacker)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the attacker is not black, the witness's identification is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker not being black in the population)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
       = [1 * 0.15] / [0.12]
       = 0.125

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.125 or 12.5%.
