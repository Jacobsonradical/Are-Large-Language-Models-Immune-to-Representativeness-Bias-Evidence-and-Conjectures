Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from information "a"). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black is the witness's accuracy rate when judging race, which is 80% (from information "b").

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (from information "b"). Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85 and the probability of encountering a black person is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17, and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is:

0.15 * 0.80 / (0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20) = 0.15 * 0.80 / 0.25 = 0.6

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.6 or 60%.
