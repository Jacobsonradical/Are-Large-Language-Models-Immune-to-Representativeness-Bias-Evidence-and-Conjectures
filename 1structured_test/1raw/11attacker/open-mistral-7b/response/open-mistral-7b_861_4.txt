Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is reliable 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We want to find this probability.

The witness's testimony implies that P(witness says black | attacker is black) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).

Similarly, P(witness says black | attacker is white) = 0.2 * P(attacker is white | witness says black), where P(attacker is white | witness says black) is the probability that the witness is mistaken, and it is equal to the inverse of the witness's reliability in identifying whites, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can set up a Bayes' theorem equation:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) / P(witness says black)

We can rewrite P(attacker is black) as 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being black in the population), and P(witness says black) as P(witness says black | attacker is black) * P(attacker is black) + P(witness says black | attacker is white) * P(attacker is white).

Solving for P(attacker is black | witness says black) yields:

P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12/0.19 = 0.632

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.632 or 63.2%.
