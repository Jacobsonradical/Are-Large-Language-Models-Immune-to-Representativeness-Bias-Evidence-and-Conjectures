Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, we do not have any information about whether the attacker was actually one of the people the witness encountered in their sample or not.

Since we cannot make an assumption about the attacker being in the witness's sample, we cannot directly apply the witness's success rate to estimate the attacker's race. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to provide a probability estimate for the attacker's race.

Answer: {probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
