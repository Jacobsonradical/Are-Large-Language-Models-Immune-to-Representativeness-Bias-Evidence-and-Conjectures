Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to incorrectly identify a white person as black and vice versa, then the probability of a correct identification given a white person is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of a correct identification given a black person is also 0.8 (80%).

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the witness's statement about the attacker being black implies that the attacker is likely to be black. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let P(B) be the probability that the attacker is black. Then, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is P(B) * 0.8.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black is (1 - P(B)) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation:

P(B) * 0.8 = 0.15 (the actual proportion of black people in the city)

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) â‰ˆ 0.2 (or 20%)

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the reliability of their race identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 20%. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and not a definitive statement of fact.
