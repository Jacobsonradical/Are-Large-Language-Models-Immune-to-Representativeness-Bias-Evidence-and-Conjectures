To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial makeup of the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black (true positive) and a white attacker as black (false positive).

Let's denote the probability of a random attacker being black as p. Then, the probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black is p. The probability of the witness identifying a white attacker as black is (1-p) * 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

The probability of a false positive can be calculated as the product of the probability of the attacker being white and the probability of the witness misidentifying a white attacker as black: (1-p) * 0.15 * 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be considered a true positive if the attacker is actually black, or a false positive if the attacker is white. So, the probability of a true positive is p, and the probability of a false positive is (1-p) * 0.15 * 0.2.

The witness's statement that the attacker is black is consistent with the attacker being black if the probability of a true positive is greater than the probability of a false positive. That is, if p > (1-p) * 0.15 * 0.2.

Solving this inequality for p, we get p > 0.05. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black is greater than 5%.

It's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's reliability and the racial makeup of the city. If the witness's reliability in identifying race is lower or if the racial makeup of the city is different, the probability estimate would be different.

So, here is the answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.05, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
