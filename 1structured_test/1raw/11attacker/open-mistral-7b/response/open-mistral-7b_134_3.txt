Given the information provided, the probability estimate for the attacker being black is as follows:

The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed black, and a 20% chance that the witness made an error.

However, we need to account for the racial demographics of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the attacker is more likely to be white due to the city's demographics.

To find the overall probability that the attacker is black, we need to weigh the witness's identification with the city's demographics. We can do this by multiplying the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race by the probability that the attacker is black in the population, and then multiplying that by the probability that the witness did not make an error, and doing the same for the probability that the attacker is white:

Probability of attacker being black = (Probability of witness's correct identification * Probability of attacker being black in population * Probability of witness's correct identification) + (Probability of witness making an error * Probability of attacker being white in population * Probability of witness making an error)

Calculating this gives us:

Probability of attacker being black = (0.8 * 0.15 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.096 + 0.017 = 0.113

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 11.3%.
