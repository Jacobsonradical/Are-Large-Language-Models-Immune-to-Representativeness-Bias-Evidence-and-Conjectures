Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial demographics of the city.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify race: The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider both pieces of information. Since the witness could not see the attacker's race, we can assume that the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race as black is equal to the witness's overall success rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also need to account for the fact that the majority of the city's population is white. If we assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is independent of the city's demographics, then the probability that the attacker is indeed black should be proportional to the city's black population.

So, the probability that the attacker is black is the witness's success rate times the proportion of black people in the city.

Mathematically, this would be:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. This means there is a 12% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics. It's important to note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as other factors could potentially influence the actual probability.
