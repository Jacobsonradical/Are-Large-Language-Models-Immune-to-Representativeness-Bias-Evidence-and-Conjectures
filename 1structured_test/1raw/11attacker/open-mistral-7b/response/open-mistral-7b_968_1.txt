Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct information about whether the witness was correct or not in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. But without knowing whether the witness's identification matches the actual race of the attacker, we can't calculate a probability for the attacker being black directly.

Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate. It would require additional information to make an informed guess.
