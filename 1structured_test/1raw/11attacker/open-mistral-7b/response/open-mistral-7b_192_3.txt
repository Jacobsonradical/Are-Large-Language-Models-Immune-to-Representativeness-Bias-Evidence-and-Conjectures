To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct identification rate and a 20% error rate. According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of an event A given evidence B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, we are interested in P(Attacker is Black | Witness's Identification), denoted as P(A|B).

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a white person as black. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we need to estimate based on the city demographics. According to the information provided, 15% of the population in the city is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being white, which is the complement of P(A), so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the 15% black population in the city due to the witness's error rate. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and actual events can deviate from expectations due to randomness.
