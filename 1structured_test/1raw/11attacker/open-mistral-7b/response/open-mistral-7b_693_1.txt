Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the attacker's race based on the new evidence provided by the witness.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% in the city's population. The probability of the witness making a mistake, given that the attacker is black, is 20%. This is the false positive rate.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is black, is 1 - the false positive rate, which is 0.80 or 80%.

The probability of the witness making a mistake, given that the attacker is white, is the false alarm rate, which is not provided in the information. However, we can assume that this rate is the same as the false positive rate, as there is no reason to believe that the witness's accuracy is affected by the attacker's race once they have turned around.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race, given that the attacker is white, is 1 - the false alarm rate, which is 0.80 or 80% as well, assuming equal false alarm rates for black and white attackers.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / (P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)

Calculating the probability, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.25 or 25%.

However, the information provided does not account for the possibility of the witness making a mistake. If the false alarm rate is the same as the false positive rate, then the probability of the witness making a mistake is 20%, regardless of the attacker's race. In this case, the posterior probability becomes:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) / (P(Witness Identification | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White) + P(Witness Mistake) * (P(Attacker is Black) + P(Attacker is White)))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * (0.15 + 0.85))

Calculating the probability, we find that the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and accounting for the possibility of a mistake, is approximately 0.21 or 21%.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.21 or 21%, accounting for the possibility of a witness mistake. However, this is a rough estimate, and the actual probability may be different depending on various factors not accounted for in the information provided.
