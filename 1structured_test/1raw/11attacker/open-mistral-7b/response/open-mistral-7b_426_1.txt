Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is black
- Î©: the attacker's race is either black or white
- E: the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of the attacker being black, P(H), is given in the first piece of information: P(H) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is black, is provided in the second piece of information: P(E|H) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is white, is 1 minus the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a white person as black: P(E|~H) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker being white, P(~H), is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Performing the calculations:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.22

Therefore:

{probability: 0.5454545454545455}

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.55.
