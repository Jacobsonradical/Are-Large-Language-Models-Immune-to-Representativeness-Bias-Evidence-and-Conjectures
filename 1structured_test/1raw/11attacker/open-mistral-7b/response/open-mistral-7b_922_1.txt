To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as black, there's a 20% chance that they made an error and the attacker is actually white.

On the other hand, the attacker being black is not an error, but the correct identification. The probability of this event is equal to the true proportion of black individuals in the city. Since 15% of the population is black, this is the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race.

To find the overall probability that the attacker is black, we need to weigh these two probabilities by their respective likelihoods. We do this by multiplying the probability of making an error (0.2) by the probability of the attacker being white given an error (the proportion of whites in the city, 0.85), and by multiplying the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's race (0.8) by the probability of the attacker being black given a correct identification (0.15).

So, the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26 or 26%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.26} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
