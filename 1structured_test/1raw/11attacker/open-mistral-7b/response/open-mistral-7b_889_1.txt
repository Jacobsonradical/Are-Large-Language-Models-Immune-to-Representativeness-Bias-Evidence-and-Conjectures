To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the demographics of the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (the witness's statement and the demographics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H). This is the probability of the witness's statement and the demographics given that the attacker is black. Since the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time, P(E|H) is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H). This is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% by the demographics of the city.

Now, we can calculate P(E). This is the probability of the witness's statement and the demographics, regardless of whether the attacker is black or white. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, P(E) is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.34 (34%). This means that, based on the evidence and the witness's ability to judge race, we believe that there is a 34% chance that the attacker is black. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and that other factors could also influence the true probability.
