To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black, and P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- Q(W) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white.

Given the information, we can express P(W) and Q(W) as follows:

P(W) = 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.8
Q(W) = 0.2 (probability of incorrect identification) = 0.2

We also know that the population is 85% white and 15% black. Let's denote:
- P(W|B) as the probability the witness identifies a black attacker as black, and P(W|~B) as the probability the witness identifies a non-black attacker as black.

Since the witness identifies half of the time, the probability of identifying a black person as black is the same as not identifying a white person as black, which means:

P(W|B) = 0.5 (probability of correct identification for a black attacker) = 0.5
P(W|~B) = 1 - P(W|B) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 (probability of incorrect identification for a white attacker) = 0.5

Now, we can represent the witness's statement that the attacker is black as a Bayes' theorem:

P(B|W) = (P(W|B) * P(B)) / (P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B))

Plugging in the values we have:

P(B|W) = (0.5 * 0.15) / (0.5 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85)

Calculating the probability:

P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.1818

So our estimate, based on the witness's statement and the city's racial demographics, is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 18.18%.
