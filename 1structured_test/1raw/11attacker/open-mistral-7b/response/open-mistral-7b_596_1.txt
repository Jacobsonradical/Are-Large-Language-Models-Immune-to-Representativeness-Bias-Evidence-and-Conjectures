Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is not directly related to the actual race of the attacker in this case, as the victim was attacked from behind and could not see the attacker's race. However, we do have information about the racial distribution of the population in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

If we assume that the attacker could be any race, then the probability that the witness would identify them as black is the witness's error rate in identifying race, which is 20%.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is white and 15% is black. If we interpret the witness's accuracy rate as representing the city's racial distribution, then the 80% accuracy in identifying race would mean that 80% of the people in the city are white (since the witness correctly identifies them as such 80% of the time) and the 20% error rate would mean that 20% of the people in the city are black (since the witness incorrectly identifies them as white 20% of the time).

This is not consistent with the actual racial distribution of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black. Therefore, the assumption that the witness's accuracy rate represents the city's racial distribution is not valid.

Given this, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black based on the information provided.
