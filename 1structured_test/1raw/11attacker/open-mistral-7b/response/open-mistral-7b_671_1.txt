Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We are interested in finding P(A|B).

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as non-black).

We also know P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being black, given the city's population distribution).

To find P(not A), we can use the law of total probability: P(not A) = P(not A|B) * P(B) + P(not A|not B) * P(not B).

However, we don't have enough information to estimate P(not A|B) and P(not A|not B). As a result, we cannot directly compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's not possible to strictly provide a numerical estimate between 0 and 1 for the probability that the attacker is black. The statement must be qualified as "cannot be determined from the provided information."
