Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, whose ability to correctly identify race is 80% and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the actual population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's assume there are two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually black (true positive).
2. The attacker is white (false positive).

We know that the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time, so the probability of a true positive is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also know that the witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability of a false positive is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of either a true positive or a false positive is 1. Therefore, we can write an equation:

P(attacker is black) = P(true positive) + P(false positive)

Plugging in the probabilities we calculated earlier:

P(attacker is black) = 0.8 + 0.2

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.8 or 80%.
