Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of the event A given evidence E is P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E), where:
- P(A|E) is the probability of the event A given the evidence E, which is what we're trying to find.
- P(E|A) is the probability of the evidence E given the event A, which is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A, which is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence. This is what we want to estimate.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E, which is given as 0.15 (85% of the population is white, and 15% is black).

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A): P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E) = (0.8 * P(A)) / 0.15

To find P(A), we can solve for it: P(A) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E) = (0.8 * P(A)) / 0.15 = P(A) / 0.15 = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.8 = 0.15

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.15. This means that, based on the witness's identification, it is slightly more likely that the attacker is white than black, despite the fact that black people make up a smaller portion of the population. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and there may be other factors that could affect the actual probability.
