Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial distribution of the city's population (85% white, 15% black) and the reliability of the witness's racial identification (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

However, the victim could not see the attacker's race, and this event is not included in the witness's data. So, we cannot directly use the witness's reliability to estimate the attacker's race.

However, if we assume that the witness's reliability is independent of the actual attacker's race and that the victim's description of the attacker is accurate, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being black and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given as 15% in the city's population. The probability of the witness identifying a black attacker as black (P(B|A)) is given as 80% by the witness's reliability. The probability of the witness identifying a white attacker as black (P(B|not A)) is given as 20% (since their error rate is 20%).

The probability of the witness identifying any attacker as black (P(B)) is the sum of these two probabilities: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

Unfortunately, we do not have the data for P(not A), which is the prior probability of the attacker being white. To calculate P(not A), we would need the exact population numbers for both races in the city.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical answer to the probability that the attacker is black based on the given information. But I hope this explanation helps you understand how Bayes' theorem could be used in this context.
