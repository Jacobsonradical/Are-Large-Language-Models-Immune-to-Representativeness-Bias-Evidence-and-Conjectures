To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:

- H: the attacker is black
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as black

The prior probability of H is the probability that the attacker is black in the population, which is given by the city's demographics: P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is black).

The likelihood of E given H is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person: P(E|H) = 0.8 (given in the first piece of information).

The likelihood of E given not H is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black: P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there is an 85% chance that the attacker is white).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.38

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.38 or 38%.
