Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we cannot directly use these percentages to estimate the probability of the attacker being black without knowing the racial composition of the group of people the attacker was among.

We do have the information that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. If we assume the attacker was among these city residents, we can make an estimate.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black).

Given the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we know that in 80% of the cases where the attacker is black, the witness will correctly identify them as black. So, we can write an equation:

0.8 * P(black) = Witness's correct identifications of black attackers

On the other hand, in 20% of the cases where the attacker is white, the witness will incorrectly identify them as black. So, we can write another equation:

0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = Witness's incorrect identifications of black attackers

We are given that the witness incorrectly identified a black attacker 20% of the time. So, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

0.8 * P(black) = 0.2 * (1 - P(black))

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) = 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 25%.
