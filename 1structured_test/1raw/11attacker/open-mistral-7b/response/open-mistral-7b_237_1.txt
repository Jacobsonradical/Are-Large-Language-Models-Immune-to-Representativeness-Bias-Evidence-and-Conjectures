To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's race identification and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's race was not seen directly, there is a chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as black is an error.

However, we also know that 85% of the city's population is white, and 15% is black. Given this information, it is more likely that the attacker is white than black, even if the witness did identify the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is black) in light of new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of hypothesis A given evidence B.
- P(B|A) is the probability of evidence B given hypothesis A.
- P(A) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.
- P(B) is the probability of evidence B.

In this case, A is the hypothesis that the attacker is black, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We can calculate P(B|A) from the witness's reliability. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We can calculate P(A) from the racial composition of the city. Since 15% of the city's population is black, P(A) = 0.15.

We can calculate P(B) by using the witness's reliability and the prior probability of the attacker being white. Since 85% of the city's population is white, P(not A) = 0.85, and P(B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.17 = 0.7647

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.7647 or 76.47%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city, it is more likely than not that the attacker is black. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not be accurate in practice.
