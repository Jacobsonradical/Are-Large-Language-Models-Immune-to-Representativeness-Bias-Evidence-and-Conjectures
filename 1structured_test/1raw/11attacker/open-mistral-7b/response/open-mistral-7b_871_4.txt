Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race: They are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The racial demographics of the city: 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

However, since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, we should consider the probability of this error happening. If the attacker was actually white, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying them as black is 20%.

Given that the attacker could be either white or black, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's error rate:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness's error given attacker is white

Probability of witness's error given attacker is white = Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black
                                                                        = 0.2 (from the given information)

Since the population is 85% white and 15% black, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being black is 0.15. However, we want to find the probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is white. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the attacker being white and B represents the witness's error. We know:

1. P(B|A) = 0.2 (from the given information)
2. P(A) = 0.85 (from the given information)
3. P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 (the probability of the witness's error happening, regardless of the attacker's race) = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.529

So the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's error, is approximately 0.529, or 52.9%. This means that there is a slightly higher probability that the attacker is white, despite the witness's statement, given the demographics of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify race.
