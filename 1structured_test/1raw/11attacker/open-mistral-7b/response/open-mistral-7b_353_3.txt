To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both the possibility that they correctly identified the attacker's race and the possibility that they made an error.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability that a randomly chosen person is white is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that they mistake a white person for a black one is 0.20.

The probability that the attacker is white and the witness mistook them for black is therefore 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

The probability that the attacker is black and the witness correctly identified them is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (or 12%).

The total probability that the attacker is black (either correctly identified or mistaken for black) is therefore 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.29}.
