The probability estimate would need to take into account both the racial makeup of the city and the accuracy of the witness's race identification. We know that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. However, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is only 80% for this specific situation.

Let's assume that the witness's identification is independent of the true race of the attacker. In this case, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is actually black is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying blacks). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black when the attacker is white is 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying whites).

Given that we don't know the actual race of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct as the weighted sum of these two probabilities, where the weights are the probabilities of the attacker being black and white, respectively.

So, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is:

0.8 * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white)

Solving this equation gives us an estimate of:

{probability: 0.24}

This means that, based on the information given, there is a 24% probability that the attacker is black.
