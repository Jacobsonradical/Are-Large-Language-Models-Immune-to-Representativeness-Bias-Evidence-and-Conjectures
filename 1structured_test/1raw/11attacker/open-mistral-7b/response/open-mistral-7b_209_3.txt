To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the population in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and considering the racial distribution of the city (85% white and 15% black), we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black based on the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(WB) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black attacker
- P(WW) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a white attacker
- P(WE) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a black attacker as white

We have the following relations from the information given:
P(B) + P(W) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities: black or white)
P(B) = 0.15 (given in the information)
P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85

We also know that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so:
P(WB) + P(WW) = 0.8
Since P(WW) = P(B) * P(correctly identifies white | black) + P(W) * P(correctly identifies white | white), we can write the following equation:
0.8 = 0.15 * P(correctly identifies white | black) + 0.85 * 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:
0.8 = 0.15 * P(correctly identifies white | black)
P(correctly identifies white | black) = 5/6

Now, we know that P(WE) = P(W) * P(erroneously identifies black | white) + P(B) * P(erroneously identifies black | black) and the witness errs 20% of the time. Using the same reasoning, we can write the following equation:
0.2 = 0.85 * P(erroneously identifies black | white) + 0.15 * P(erroneously identifies black | black)

Simplifying this equation, we get:
0.2 = 0.85 * P(erroneously identifies black | white)
P(erroneously identifies black | white) = 0.2/0.85 ≈ 0.2353

Since P(correctly identifies white | black) = 5/6, we can write the following equation for P(WE):
P(WE) = 0.85 * 0.2353 + 0.15 * P(erroneously identifies black | black)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(erroneously identifies black | black) directly, but we can rewrite the equation for P(WB) using P(WE):
P(WB) = 0.8 - P(WE)

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we are interested in P(WB). Using the calculated values for P(WE) and the witness's reliability in identifying race, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(WB) ≈ 0.8 - 0.2 * (0.2353 + 0.15 * P(erroneously identifies black | black))

Given the limited information, it is impossible to calculate the exact value of P(erroneously identifies black | black), so we will provide an estimate based on the given information.
