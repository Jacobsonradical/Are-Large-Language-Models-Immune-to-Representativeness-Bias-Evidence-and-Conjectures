To provide an estimate, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying race and the racial composition of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's race was not seen directly, we can treat each identification as an independent event. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as white is 0.2 (20%).

However, we know that 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black. This means that if the attacker were white, the witness would be more likely to correctly identify the attacker as white than to incorrectly identify the attacker as black.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black and compare it to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.2 (20%), given that the attacker is white. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black:

The probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15%), given the racial composition of the city. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

Since the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white attacker as black (0.17) is higher than the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black (0.12), it is more likely that the attacker is white. However, the witness's ability to identify race is not perfect, and the racial composition of the city is not equally distributed. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that the attacker is white.

Given these considerations, a conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker as black (0.12), although this is likely an underestimate. Therefore, the probability {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
