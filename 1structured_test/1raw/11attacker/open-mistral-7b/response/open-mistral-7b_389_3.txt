Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the attacker's race was not definitively established by the victim, we can consider the witness's statement as a potential piece of evidence.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as "p". Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black is 1 - p.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness being wrong, given that they identified the attacker as black, is the error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).

However, we also know the racial composition of the city. Since 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being black, which we will denote as "q".

Given this information, we can set up Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being black:

P(black | identified as black) = P(identified as black | black) * P(black) / P(identified as black)

We can calculate P(identified as black | black) as 0.8 (the witness's correct rate), P(black) as q (the prior probability), and P(identified as black) as 0.8q + 0.2(1-q) (the probability of the witness making the observation, given the true population distribution).

Solving for q, we get:

q = (0.8 * P(identified as black | black)) / (0.8 * P(identified as black | black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(identified as black | black)))

Substituting the given values, we get:

q = (0.8 * 0.8) / (0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.2)

q = 0.64

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.64 (64%).
