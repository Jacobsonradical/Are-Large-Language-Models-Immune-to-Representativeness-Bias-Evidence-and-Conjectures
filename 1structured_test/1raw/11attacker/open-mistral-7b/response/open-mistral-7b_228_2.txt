To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is black)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying black people)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (before considering the hypothesis)

Let's break this down:

1. P(E|H) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the race 80% of the time)
2. P(H) is given as 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
3. P(E) can be calculated as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   - P(E|not H) is given as 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the race 20% of the time)
   - P(not H) is given as 0.85 (85% of the population is white)
   - So, P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
   - Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1265

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.1265
        = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this is just the probability based on the witness's identification. In a real-world scenario, other evidence and considerations should be taken into account.
