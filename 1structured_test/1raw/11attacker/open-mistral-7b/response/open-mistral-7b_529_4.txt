To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker could be either black or white, then the probability of the witness making an error when identifying the attacker's race is equal to the probability of the attacker being the opposite race.

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the attacker being white is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness making an error and identifying the attacker as black is 0.85.

Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, we cannot simply use the witness's correct identification rate of 0.80 as our estimate, because the witness did identify the attacker as black. If the attacker was actually white, then the witness would have made an error, which has a probability of 0.85. Therefore, the actual probability that the attacker is black is lower than 0.80.

To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is black, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black.

We have P(B|A) = 0.80, P(A) = 0.15 (from the racial composition of the city), and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.1083

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 10.83%. This is much lower than the witness's identification rate, suggesting that the witness may have been biased or made an error in this case.
