To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the racial distribution of the population.

The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct identification and 20% error rate. However, since we don't know if the witness made an error in this particular case, we should consider both possibilities: the witness correctly identified the attacker as black (80% chance) and the witness made an error (20% chance).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a random person being black is 15%. If the witness made an error, then the attacker is likely to be white (given the racial distribution in the city).

So, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified the attacker as black is 0.8 (80%) times the probability of the witness being correct, plus 0.2 (20%) times the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being white.

Let P(black) be the probability that the attacker is black. We can write an equation:

0.8 * P(black) + 0.2 * (1 - P(black)) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15

Solving for P(black), we get:

P(black) â‰ˆ 0.72

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.72, or 72%.
