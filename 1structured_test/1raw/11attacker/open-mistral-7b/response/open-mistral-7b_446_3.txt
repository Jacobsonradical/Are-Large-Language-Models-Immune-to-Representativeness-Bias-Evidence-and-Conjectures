Given the information provided, we can't make a direct estimation of the probability that the attacker is black based solely on the description of the attack and the witness's ability to identify race. However, we can use the population statistics provided (85% white, 15% black) and the witness's accuracy in race identification to make an indirect estimation.

Here's how we can reason:
1. The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time.
2. If the witness sees a white person, there's a 20% chance they might mistake it for a black person.
3. Given that 85% of the population is white, the number of white people the witness might mistakenly identify as black is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).
4. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, they would correctly identify white people 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68 (68%) of the time.
5. Therefore, out of the 68% of correctly identified white people, the actual attacker must be one of the 15% black people in the population.
6. So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is the ratio of correctly identified black people to the total correctly identified people: 0.15 / (0.68 + 0.15) = 0.18 (18%)

However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and simplifications, including the assumption that the witness's ability to identify race in this specific situation is the same as in their sample of people. Therefore, this estimate should be treated as an approximation and not as a definitive probability.

Answer: {probability: 0.18, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
