Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is black, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

From the information provided, we know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is black), and P(B) = 0.85 * 0.1 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.127 (the probability of a random person being identified as black by the witness).

Using these values, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.127 â‰ˆ 0.62

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.62 or 62%.
