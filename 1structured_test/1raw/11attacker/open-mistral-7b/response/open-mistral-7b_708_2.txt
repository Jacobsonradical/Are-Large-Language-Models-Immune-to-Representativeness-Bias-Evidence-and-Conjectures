Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that an attacker is black in the city)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that an attacker is white in the city)

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
