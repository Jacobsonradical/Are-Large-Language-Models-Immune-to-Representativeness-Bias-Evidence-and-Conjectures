The given information suggests that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we need to consider both the true population proportion of blacks and the witness's error rate.

Let's assume that the actual probability of the attacker being black is P. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a white person as black is 1 - P.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of this event happening due to a true black attacker (P) is multiplied by the probability of the witness being correct (0.8). On the other hand, the probability of this event happening due to a white attacker (1 - P) and the witness erring is multiplied by the probability of the witness being incorrect (0.2).

In mathematical terms:

P(attacker is black | witness's statement) = P * 0.8 + (1 - P) * 0.2

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this equation represents the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

To find an estimate for P, we can solve this equation for P:

P = (P * 0.8) / (P * 0.8 + (1 - P) * 0.2)

We can simplify this equation to get a quadratic equation in P:

P^2 - 0.8P + 0.08 = 0

Solving this equation, we find two possible solutions for P: 0.73 and 0.27. However, since the probability of the attacker being black should be between 0 and 1, the valid solution is P = 0.73.

So, given the witness's statement and their error rate, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.73 or 73%.
