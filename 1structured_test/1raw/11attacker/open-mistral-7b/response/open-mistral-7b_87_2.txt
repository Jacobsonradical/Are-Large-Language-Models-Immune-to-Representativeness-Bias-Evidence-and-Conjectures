Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying race is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we should consider the attacker's race as being equally likely to be either black or white, as there is no information to suggest otherwise.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In our case, A is the event of the attacker being black, B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as black.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the city's population statistics as 0.15 (15%).

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black if the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (80%).

P(B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying any person as black, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.268

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.268 (26.8%).
