Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black is an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the population demographics.

Let's break this down:

1. The population demographics are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot assume that the witness was correct 100% of the time, given their error rate of 20%. Therefore, we need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error.

Let's represent the true race of the attacker as X (either 0 for white or 1 for black). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is P(X=1|witness's statement), and the probability that the witness makes an error is P(X=0|witness's statement).

Given the witness's 80% success rate, we can calculate the probability of their statement being correct as P(X=1|witness's statement) = 0.8.

The probability of their statement being incorrect is P(X=0|witness's statement) = 1 - P(X=1|witness's statement) = 0.2.

Since the population demographics are 85% white and 15% black, we can calculate the prior probabilities as P(X=1) = 0.15 and P(X=0) = 0.85.

Given that the witness made a statement, we can calculate the posterior probabilities as P(X=1|witness's statement) = P(witness's statement|X=1) * P(X=1) / P(witness's statement) and P(X=0|witness's statement) = P(witness's statement|X=0) * P(X=0) / P(witness's statement).

However, we do not have enough information to calculate P(witness's statement|X=0) and P(witness's statement|X=1). We only know that P(witness's statement|X=1) = 0.8 and P(witness's statement|X=0) is somewhere between 0 and 0.2 (due to the witness's error rate).

Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. We would need additional information to calculate the probabilities P(witness's statement|X=0) and P(witness's statement|X=1) and, consequently, P(X=1|witness's statement) and P(X=0|witness's statement).
