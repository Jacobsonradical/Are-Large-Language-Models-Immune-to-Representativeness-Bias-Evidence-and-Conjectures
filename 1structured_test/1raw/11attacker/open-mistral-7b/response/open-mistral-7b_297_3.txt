Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to make an estimate:

1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. The reliability of the witness's racial identification, which is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we need to consider both the likelihood of a black attacker in the city and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's race as black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). According to the given demographics, P(black) = 0.15.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is represented by the probability P(correct), which is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can write an equation to represent the possibility that the witness was correct in their identification:

P(correct) = P(attacker is black) * P(witness correctly identifies black attacker) + P(attacker is not black) * P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker as black)

We can simplify this equation using the given data:

0.8 = 0.15 * P(correctly identifies black attacker) + 0.85 * P(incorrectly identifies white attacker as black)

We know that the witness's incorrect identification rate is 0.2, so P(incorrectly identifies white attacker as black) = 0.2.

Now we have an equation with two unknowns, P(correctly identifies black attacker) and P(black). To find an estimate for P(black), we can solve this equation numerically or graphically:

P(correctly identifies black attacker) = (0.8 - 0.85 * 0.2) / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.8667

So, based on the given demographics and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.8667 or 86.67%. However, it is essential to remember that this estimate assumes that the witness's racial identification ability remains consistent under the specific conditions of the night attack, which may not be the case in reality.
