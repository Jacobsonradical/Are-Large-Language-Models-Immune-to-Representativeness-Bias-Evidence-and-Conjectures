Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B), and the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black as P(W|B).

From the first piece of information, we know that P(W|B) = 0.8.

The other piece of information tells us that the prior probability of the attacker being black is P(B) = n(B) / (n(B) + n(W)), where n(B) is the number of black people in the city and n(W) is the number of white people.

From the second piece of information, we know that the population is 85% white and 15% black. So, n(W) = 0.85 * total population, and n(B) = 0.15 * total population.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.15 * total population / (0.15 * total population + 0.85 * total population)
     = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85)
     = 0.15 / 1
     = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)

We know P(W|B) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W). In practice, P(W) is often estimated as the prior probability, but without more information, it's not possible to provide a precise value.

However, we can still provide an estimate of P(B|W) by assuming that P(W) is the same as P(B), which means that the witness's identification is not biased towards either race. Under this assumption, we get:

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / P(W)
        ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15
        ≈ 0.8

So, under the assumption that the witness's identification is not biased, the estimated probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification is 0.8. This means that the attacker is approximately 80% likely to be black based on the witness's identification.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different, and the witness's identification might be biased or unreliable. Therefore, this estimate should be treated as a rough approximation and not as definitive proof.
