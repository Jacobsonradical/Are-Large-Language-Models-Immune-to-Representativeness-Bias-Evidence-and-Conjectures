Given the information provided, we have a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying race and has a 20% error rate. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct information about this specific identification made by the witness.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our belief is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, event A is the attacker being black, event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, and P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.

P(B|A) is given as 0.8 (80%), and P(A) is not given. We can use the information about the city's population to estimate P(A), as the attacker could be any person in the city. From the information given, 15% of the city's population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as black. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12
P(A|B) = 0.125

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.125 or 12.5%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on the given information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different if more specific information about the attacker or the witness's identification was available.
