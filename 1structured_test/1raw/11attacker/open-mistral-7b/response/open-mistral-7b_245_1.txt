Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The general probability of an attacker being black in the city. This is given by the city's demographic data: 15% or 0.15.

2. The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's race. Since the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, the error rate is 20% or 0.20.

The witness reported that the attacker was black. If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black. If the witness is incorrect, then the attacker is white. The overall probability of the witness being correct is the probability of the attacker being black (0.15) multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.80), plus the probability of the attacker being white (1 - 0.15 = 0.85) multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (0.20).

So, the probability that the witness is correct is (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, regardless of whether they are identifying a black or white person. If the witness is more likely to make errors when identifying white people as black (which is suggested by the fact that they live in a city where 85% of the population is white), then the overall probability of the witness being correct could be lower than 0.29.

Without more information, it's impossible to calculate an exact probability. But based on the information provided, the best estimate would be the 29% calculated above.
