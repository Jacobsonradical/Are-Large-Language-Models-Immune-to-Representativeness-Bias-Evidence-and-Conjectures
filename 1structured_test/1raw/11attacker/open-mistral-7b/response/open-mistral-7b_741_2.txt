Based on the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black is estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is white, and 15% is black.
2. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is only 80% under similar conditions, meaning they err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black, but their identification is not necessarily accurate due to their error rate.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification (80%) times the true probability of the attacker being black (15%), plus the probability of the witness making an error (20%) times the probability of the attacker being white (85%):

{probability: 0.12}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%.
