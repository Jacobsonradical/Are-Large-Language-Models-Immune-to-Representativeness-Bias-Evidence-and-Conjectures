Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed among the population, which according to information b, is 85% white and 15% black, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

P(A|B) is the probability we want to find, which is the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black, which is given as 0.8 (from information a).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black, which is the probability we're trying to find.
P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black, which is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a black person and her erroneously identifying a white person as black. Since she correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, her errors are 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is white, the probability of erroneously identifying a white person as black is 20% * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

So, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.816 (after solving for P(A))

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.816 or 81.6%.
