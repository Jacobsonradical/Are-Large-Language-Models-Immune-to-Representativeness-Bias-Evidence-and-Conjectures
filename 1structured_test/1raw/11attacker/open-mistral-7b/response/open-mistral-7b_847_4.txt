Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% white and 15% black.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory dealing with conditional probability, which in this case can help us calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's observation.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (which we know is 0.8 from the witness's accuracy).
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is black in the population (the quantity we want to find).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as black (which is a combination of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2, but since we don't have the probability of the attacker being not black, we cannot calculate this value directly).

However, we can use the city's population composition to estimate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * P(not A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Since we don't have P(not A), we can substitute it with the city's population composition:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A)
2. P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17

By solving these equations, we can find an estimate for P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17)

Since P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black, it must be a number between 0 and 1. We can solve this equation numerically to find an approximate value for P(A).

Using a calculator, the solution is approximately P(A) = 0.31, which means there is a 31% chance that the attacker is black.

In summary, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
