To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is black.
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(H) as the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker is black before considering the evidence.
- P(E|H) as the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the probability that a black person is mistakenly identified as white by the witness.
- P(H|E) as the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which is the probability that the attacker is black after considering the witness's statement.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. P(E|H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a black person).
2. P(H) = 0.15 (the attacker is black, given the city's demographic information).

We need to find P(H|E).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the probability that a black person is mistakenly identified as black or a white person is correctly identified by the witness.

To calculate P(E), we can use the witness's accuracy: P(E|H) + P(E|~H) = 1, where ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is white.

Given that P(E|H) = 0.2, we can calculate P(E|~H) as 1 - P(E|H) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(E) as P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.21.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) as P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.2381.

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.2381 or 23.81%.
