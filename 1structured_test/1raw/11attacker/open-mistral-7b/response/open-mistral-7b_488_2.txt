Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness's identification was correct in this case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and unrelated to the attacker's race, then the probability that the witness made an error in this case is the same as their error rate: 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness was correct minus the probability that the witness was wrong:

{probability: 0.8, explanation: 0.8 (probability of correct identification) - 0.2 (probability of error)}
