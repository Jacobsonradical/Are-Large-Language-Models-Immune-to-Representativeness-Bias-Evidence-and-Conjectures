To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of H, P(H), is the probability of the attacker being black before considering the evidence. The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly given that he/she is black. The likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|not-H), is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker incorrectly given that he/she is white.

We are given:

- P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(E|not-H) = 0.2 (from information a)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.15

P(H|E) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 or 80%. This means that, based on this evidence, it's eight times more likely that the attacker is black than white. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and other evidence or considerations might lead to different conclusions.
