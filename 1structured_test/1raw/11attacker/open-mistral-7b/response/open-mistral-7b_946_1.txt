Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, according to this witness's account, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this is not the actual probability, as the witness's identification may not be accurate due to the poor lighting conditions. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the true probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, A is the attacker being black, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as black. Let's denote the prior probability of the attacker being black as P(A), and the probability of the witness identifying a black person as black as P(B|A).

Using the witness's statistics, P(B|A) = 0.8. The prior probability P(A) is not given, but we can make an educated guess given the city's demographics. According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

Finally, we need to estimate the probability of the witness identifying a white person as black, which we'll denote as P(B|not A). Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Given that 85% of the population is white, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.62

The true probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.62. This estimate takes into account the witness's error rate and the demographic distribution of the city.
