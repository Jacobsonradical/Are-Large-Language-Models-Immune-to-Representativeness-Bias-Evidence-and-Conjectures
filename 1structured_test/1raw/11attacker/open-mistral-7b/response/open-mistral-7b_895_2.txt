To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black) given the evidence (the witness's statement)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have three pieces of information:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (The probability that the attacker is black in the population is 15%)
3. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          = 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
