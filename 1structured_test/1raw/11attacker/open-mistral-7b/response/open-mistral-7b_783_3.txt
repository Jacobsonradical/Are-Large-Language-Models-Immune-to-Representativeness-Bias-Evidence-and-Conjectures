To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is black is p(E|H) = 0.8 (based on the provided information).

The prior probability of the attacker being black is p(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is black).

The probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is white is p(E|~H) = 0.2 (based on the provided information).

The prior probability of the attacker being white is p(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is white).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of the attacker being black:

p(H|E) = [p(E|H) * p(H)] / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|~H) * p(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

p(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we find:
