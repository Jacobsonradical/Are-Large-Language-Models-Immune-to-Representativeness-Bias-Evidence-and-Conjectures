Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black. This is because we do not know if the witness's identification is correct or an error.

To make an estimate, we can consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. If the witness errs 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that they incorrectly identified the attacker as black when the attacker is actually white.

Since 85% of the population is white, the probability that the attacker is white is 0.85. This means that the probability that the witness made an error and identified a white person as black is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is 1 - the probability that the witness made an error = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.83}.
