To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial distribution of the city's population.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't know whether the witness made a correct identification or an error.

To account for this uncertainty, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event given new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let P(B) be the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given by the racial distribution of the city: P(B) = 0.15.

Let P(B|W) be the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification, which is what we want to find.

Let P(W|B) be the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is black, which is 0.8 (from the data).

Let P(W|~B) be the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is not black, which is 0.5 (assuming that the probability of identifying a white person correctly is the same as identifying a black person incorrectly).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)].

Substituting the values, we get: P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.26 = 0.4615.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.4615 (46.15%). This means that, given the witness's identification and the racial distribution of the city, we believe that the attacker is likely to be black, but there is still some uncertainty.
