Given the two pieces of information provided, the population data (a) suggests that 85% of the city's population is white and 15% is black. However, a witness has reported the attacker as black (b). The witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the incorrect identification rate is 20%.

Since the witness's accuracy is lower than the actual population distribution, it's likely that the witness might have made an error in this case as well. To estimate the probability of the attacker being black, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Report) = [P(Witness Report | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / [P(Witness Report | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) + P(Witness Report | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]

We are given that P(Witness Report | Attacker is Black) = 0.8, P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15, and we need to find P(Witness Report | Attacker is White) and P(Attacker is White).

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(Witness Report | Attacker is White) = 0.2.

We can now compute the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness Report) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414 or 41.4%

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.414 or 41.4%.
