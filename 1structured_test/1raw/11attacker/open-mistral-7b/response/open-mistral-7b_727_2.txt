Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population, with 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the second piece of information introduces a complication. The witness's accuracy is based on a sample of people that was half white and half black. This does not necessarily reflect the accuracy of identifying race in a population that is 85% white and 15% black.

To make an estimate, we could assume that the witness's ability to identify race is independent of the racial distribution of the population. In this case, the witness's estimate of the attacker's race being black (given in the second piece of information) would be a reliable indicator of the actual attacker's race.

However, this assumption is not necessarily valid. People's ability to accurately identify race can be influenced by the racial distribution of the population they are observing. In a city where 85% of the population is white, it might be more challenging to accurately identify a black individual, especially in low light conditions as mentioned.

Therefore, without more specific information about how the witness's accuracy might be influenced by the racial distribution of the population, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.
