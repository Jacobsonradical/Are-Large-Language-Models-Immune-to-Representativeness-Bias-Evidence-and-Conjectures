Given the information provided, the population composition is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying races has identified the attacker as black. The witness's accuracy in identifying races is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually black, we can consider the probability of the witness making a correct identification (given that the attacker is black) and the probability of the witness making an error (given that the attacker is white).

Let's denote:
P(B) = Probability that the attacker is black
P(W) = Probability that the attacker is white

Given the population statistics, P(B) = 0.15 and P(W) = 0.85.

The witness correctly identifies a black person (B) with probability 0.8, and incorrectly identifies a white person (W) as black with probability 0.2.

So, we have:

P(Correctly identifies B) = P(B) * Probability of correct identification given B = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(Incorrectly identifies W as B) = P(W) * Probability of error given W = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as black is the sum of the two probabilities above:

P(Witness identifies B) = P(Correctly identifies B) + P(Incorrectly identifies W as B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, we are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. This is the conditional probability P(B|Witness identifies B), and it can be calculated as follows:

P(B|Witness identifies B) = P(Witness identifies B | B) * P(B) / P(Witness identifies B)

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

P(B|Witness identifies B) = (P(Witness identifies B | B) * P(B)) / P(Witness identifies B)

Substituting the probabilities we calculated above, we get:

P(B|Witness identifies B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, given the witness's identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
