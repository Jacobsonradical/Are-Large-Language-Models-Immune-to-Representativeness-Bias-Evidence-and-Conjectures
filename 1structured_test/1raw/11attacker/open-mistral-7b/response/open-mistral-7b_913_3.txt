To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial composition of the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80%, and the city's racial composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of a random person in the city being black as P(black), and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black as Q. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, we know that Q = 0.2.

The city's racial composition means that P(black) = 0.15. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is then Q = 0.2.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is P(black) * (1 - Q) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person divided by the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

So the probability that the attacker is black is P(attacker is black | witness identification) = P(black | witness identification) / (P(black | witness identification) + Q) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2) = 0.3846

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 38.46%.
