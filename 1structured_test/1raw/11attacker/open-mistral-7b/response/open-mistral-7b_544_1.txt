To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, the event A is "the attacker is black," and the event B is "the witness identified the attacker as black."

We are given the following information:

1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is black. This is what we want to find.
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a black person as black. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies a non-black person as black. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.
4. P(A) + P(~A) = 1, where ~A means "the attacker is not black." Since 85% of the population is white, P(~A) = 0.85.

To find P(A), we can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
          = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

To find a numerical estimate for P(A), we need to make an assumption about P(A). Without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the city's demographics. Given that 15% of the population is black, one reasonable assumption is P(A) = 0.15.

Using this assumption, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
      = 0.12 / 0.21
      â‰ˆ 0.571

So, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, our best estimate is that the attacker is black with a probability of approximately 0.571. Note that this estimate is sensitive to the assumption we made about P(A), so a more accurate estimate would require additional information.
