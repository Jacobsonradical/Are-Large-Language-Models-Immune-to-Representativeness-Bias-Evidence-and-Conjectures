Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% (0.8), and they make an error 20% of the time (0.2). The witness identified the attacker as black. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as the probability of the witness being correct, which is the probability of the witness making a correct identification times the true probability of the attacker being black.

Assuming that the attacker's race is equally likely to be black or white, the true probability of the attacker being black is 15% (0.15) according to the city's population statistics.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, probability of 0.12 or 12%}

However, it's important to note that this estimation assumes that the witness's identification accuracy is not influenced by the race of the person they are identifying. If there is a bias in the witness's identification, this estimation may not accurately reflect the true probability. Also, the city's population statistics may not accurately represent the attacker's race, especially if the attack occurred in an area with a different demographic composition.
