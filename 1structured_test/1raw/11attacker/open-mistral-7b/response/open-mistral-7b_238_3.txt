To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's racial identification and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying race, and a 20% error rate. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as black. Given the racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the likelihood of a random person being black is 0.15 (or 15%).

The witness's error rate means that for every 100 people they identify, they will incorrectly identify 20 as the opposite race. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as black, which is inconsistent with the majority population.

Therefore, we should consider the likelihood that the witness's mistake was due to their error rate, rather than the attacker's actual race. In other words, the witness might have incorrectly identified the attacker as black, even though the attacker was actually white.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that they would mistakenly identify a white person as black is also 20%. Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of a random white person being mistakenly identified as black is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.023 or 2.3%.

However, since the witness did identify the attacker as black, it's more likely that the attacker is indeed black and the witness's identification was correct, rather than an error. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is higher than the 15% racial demographic.

Given these considerations, an estimate for the probability that the attacker is black could be around 40-50%, taking into account the witness's reliability and the city's racial demographics.
