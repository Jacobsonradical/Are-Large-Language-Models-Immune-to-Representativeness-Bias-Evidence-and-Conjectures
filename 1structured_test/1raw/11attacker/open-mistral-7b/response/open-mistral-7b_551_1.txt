To provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial composition of the city's population.

Given the information, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being black as P(black). We also know the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, P(witness_error_white), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white, P(witness_error_black).

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can write the following equation:

P(witness_error_white) + P(witness_error_black) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, we can also write:

P(witness_error_white) = 0.85 * P(witness_estimates_white_as_black | white) + 0.15 * P(witness_estimates_white_as_black | black)

P(witness_error_black) = 0.15 * P(witness_estimates_black_as_white | white) + 0.85 * P(witness_estimates_black_as_white | black)

Since the witness is more likely to make an error with white people, there should be a higher probability of them estimating a white person as black than a black person as white. Let's assume that P(witness_estimates_white_as_black | white) > P(witness_estimates_black_as_white | black).

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time, we can also write:

P(witness_estimates_correctly_white | white) = 0.8
P(witness_estimates_correctly_black | black) = 0.8

We can also write:

P(witness_estimates_white_as_black | white) = 1 - P(witness_estimates_correctly_white | white) = 0.2
P(witness_estimates_black_as_white | black) = 1 - P(witness_estimates_correctly_black | black) = 0.2

Now, we have enough information to solve the system of equations. However, due to the assumptions made about P(witness_estimates_white_as_black | white) > P(witness_estimates_black_as_white | black) and P(witness_estimates_correctly_white | white) = P(witness_estimates_correctly_black | black) = 0.8, the actual probability of the attacker being black would depend on these assumptions.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical answer without further information, but based on the given assumptions, the probability of the attacker being black would be higher than 15%.
