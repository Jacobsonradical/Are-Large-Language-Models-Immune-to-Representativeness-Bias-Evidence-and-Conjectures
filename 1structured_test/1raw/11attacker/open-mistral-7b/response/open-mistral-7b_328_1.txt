To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's identification and the racial composition of the city.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is black as P(black). The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black with probability 0.2, and a black person as white with probability 0.2. Since the population is half white and half black, the witness's errors in both directions cancel out, and the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability P(black|witness_black) is the proportion of times the witness would correctly identify a black attacker out of all the times the attacker is black. This can be calculated as:

P(black|witness_black) = P(witness_black|black) * P(black) / (P(witness_black|black) * P(black) + P(witness_black|not black) * P(not black))

Using the given information, we have P(witness_black|black) = 0.8, P(black) = 0.15, and P(witness_black|not black) = 0, as the witness never mistakes a white person for a black one. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(black|witness_black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.12

So the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify race is the same in court as in the given conditions. If the court conditions make the witness less reliable, the probability might be lower. If the witness is more reliable, the probability might be higher. But given the information provided, the attacker is estimated to be black with a probability of 0.12.
