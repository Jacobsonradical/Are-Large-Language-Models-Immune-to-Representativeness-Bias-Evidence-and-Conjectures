Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

The prior probability of H, P(H), is given as 15% in the city's population.
The likelihood of E given H, P(E|H), is the witness's accuracy in identifying black people, which is 80%.
The likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|not-H), is the witness's error rate in identifying black people, which is 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of H given E, P(H|E), is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the likelihood of E given not-H, P(E|not-H), requires knowing the witness's accuracy in identifying white people, which isn't given in the information. However, we can use the fact that the witness was correct 80% of the time in identifying black people, so the error rate in identifying white people must be less than 20%. Assuming it's 10%, we can approximate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.15 / 0.25 ≈ 0.6

So, based on the given information and the assumption of a 10% error rate in identifying white people, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.6 or 60%.
