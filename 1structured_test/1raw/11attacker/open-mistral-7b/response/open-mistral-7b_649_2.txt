Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:
1. The racial demographics of the city, where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.
2. A witness's ability to correctly identify race, which is 80% accurate for white and black individuals, and 20% inaccurate.

However, there is a third piece of information that is missing but crucial to making a reliable estimate: whether the witness's mistake in identifying the attacker as black was a false positive (mistakenly identifying a white person as black) or a false negative (mistakenly identifying a black person as white).

Without this information, we cannot accurately calculate the probability that the attacker is black. The witness's error rate of 20% is an overall error rate and does not specify whether the errors were evenly distributed between false positives and false negatives.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical probability estimate in the requested format. To make an informed estimate, more information is needed.
