To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

First, we need to find the prior probability of the attacker being black, P(A). According to information b, 15% of the population is black, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black, P(B|A). According to information a, the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is white, P(B|not A). Since the witness is less accurate in identifying white people, let's assume that they correctly identify race 70% of the time and err 30% of the time. So, P(B|not A) = 0.7.

Finally, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying any person as black, P(B). Since 15% of the population is black, and the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time when the person is black, P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.12

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 66.67%.
