Given the two pieces of information provided:

1. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as black.

Let's break this down:

1. We know that the attacker is either black or white, but we don't have any other information to differentiate between the two.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify race is independent of the actual race of the attacker.
3. In 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies a black person as black. This means that in 80% of the cases where the attacker is truly black, the witness will correctly identify the attacker's race.
4. In 20% of the cases, the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white. This means that in 20% of the cases where the attacker is truly black, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker's race.

Now, let's consider the probability that the witness identified a black attacker correctly. This would be the product of the probability of the attacker being black and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black.

So, the probability of the witness's correct identification = Probability of attacker being black * Probability of witness correctly identifying a black person as black
                                                                                         = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                                         = 0.12

However, the witness also identified the attacker as black in some cases where the attacker is actually white. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white 20% of the time, and the city's population is 85% white, there will be some cases where the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

The probability of the witness's incorrect identification due to misidentifying a white person as black is:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white as black = Probability of attacker being white * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white
                                                                                            = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                                            = 0.17

Now, we can find the probability that the witness identified a white attacker as black due to this mistake:

Probability of witness mistakenly identifying white as black = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying white as black * Probability of attacker being white
                                                                                            = 0.17 * 0.85
                                                                                            = 0.1465

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as black, and the sum of the probabilities of all possible scenarios must equal 1, we can find the probability that the attacker is black by subtracting the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black:

Probability of attacker being black = Probability of witness's correct identification + Probability of witness's incorrect identification due to misidentifying white as black
                                                          = 0.12 + 0.1465
                                                          = 0.2665

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, the witness's identification of the attacker as black seems to be inconsistent with the actual population distribution. This suggests that there might be some inconsistency or missing information in the given data.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's not possible to estimate the probability of the attacker being black strictly between 0 and 1. The inconsistency in the data might indicate that further information or a reevaluation of the data is needed.
