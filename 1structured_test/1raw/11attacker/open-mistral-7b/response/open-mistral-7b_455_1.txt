To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs in the presence of new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

We are given:
1. P(A) = Probability of the attacker being black (unknown, but we will estimate it later).
2. P(B | A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (given in the first piece of information).
3. P(B | ∼A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-black person as black (since the witness's error rate is 20%, this is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2).
4. P(A) + P(∼A) = 1 (since the attacker must be either black or not black).

We are also given that 85% of the population is white (P(∼A)) and 15% is black (P(A)).

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / (P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ∼A) * P(∼A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A | B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Solving this equation, we find that P(A | B) = 0.3846, or approximately 38.46%.

So, given the information provided, the attacker has an estimated probability of 0.3846 (or 38.46%) of being black.
