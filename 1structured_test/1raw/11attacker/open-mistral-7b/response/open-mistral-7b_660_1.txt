Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. If we assume that the attacker's race is randomly distributed among the population, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the attacker being black, E is the witness's identification, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (which we don't have directly), P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (0.8), and P(E) is the likelihood of the witness making the observation E (which is the sum of the likelihood of observing E given H is true and the likelihood of observing E given H is false).

P(E|H) = 0.8
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the error rate)
P(H) = unknown

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We know that P(not H) = 1 - P(H), and the population is 85% white and 15% black, so P(not H) = 0.85.

P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.85

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(H):

P(H) = (P(E) - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

However, we don't have a direct measure of P(E). Instead, we can make an assumption based on the witness's performance. If the witness's observation is independent of the attacker's race, then we would expect the witness to make a correct identification 50% of the time, as the attacker's race is randomly distributed. In this case, P(E) = 0.5.

Using this assumption, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(H) = (0.5 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.194

So, given the witness's ability to identify race and the racial composition of the population, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 19.4%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's observation is independent of the attacker's race, which may not be the case in reality.
