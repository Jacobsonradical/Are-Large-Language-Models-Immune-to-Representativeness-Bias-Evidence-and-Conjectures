Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

The witness identified the attacker as black, which means their identification could be correct or an error. If we assume that the witness is just as likely to make an error as to correctly identify the race, then the probability that the attacker is black is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification.

The probability of making a correct identification is the witness's success rate, which is 80%. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is:

{probability: 0.8}
