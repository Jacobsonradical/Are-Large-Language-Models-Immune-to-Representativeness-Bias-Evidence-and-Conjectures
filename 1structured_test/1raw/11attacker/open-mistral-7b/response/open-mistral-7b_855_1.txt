Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we do not have any information about whether the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a black person as white or vice versa.

Given that 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, it seems more likely that the witness's error would be misidentifying a black person as white, given the city's demographics. If this is the case, the probability that the attacker is indeed black would be higher than 80%.

However, without more information, we cannot make a definitive estimate. Therefore, I must provide a probability range. The probability that the witness's identification is correct is 80%, but given the demographic information, the probability that the attacker is black may be slightly higher than this. Therefore, my estimate would be:

{probability: between 0.8 and 1}
