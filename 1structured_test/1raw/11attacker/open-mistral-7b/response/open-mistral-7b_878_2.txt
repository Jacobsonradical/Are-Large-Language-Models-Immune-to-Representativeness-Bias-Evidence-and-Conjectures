To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying races and the racial composition of the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is black
- P(W) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person
- Q(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is black

We have two pieces of information:
1) P(W) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge race)
2) Q(B) = 0.15 (from the racial composition of the city)

The witness's statement that the attacker is black can be seen as evidence for the attacker being black, but it's not perfect evidence. We need to consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake. So, the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is black, is P(W).

On the other hand, the probability that the witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is black, is 1 - P(W) = 0.2.

However, we don't know whether the witness is actually correct or incorrect. To account for both possibilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B | witness statement) = [P(witness statement | B) * P(B)] / [P(witness statement | B) * P(B) + P(witness statement | not B) * P(not B)]

We can simplify this equation by substituting the known probabilities:

P(B | witness statement) = [P(W) * P(B)] / [P(W) * P(B) + (1 - P(W)) * (1 - P(B))]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(B | witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)]

P(B | witness statement) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, based on the witness statement and the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.18 or 18%. This is lower than the actual racial composition of the city's population (15%), suggesting that the witness's statement might be less reliable than the racial makeup of the city.
