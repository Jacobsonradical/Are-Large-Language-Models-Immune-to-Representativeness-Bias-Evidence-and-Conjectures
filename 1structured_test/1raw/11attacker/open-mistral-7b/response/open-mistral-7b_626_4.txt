Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is black
- B is the new evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black, which is given as 15% (0.15)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person as black, which is given as 80% (0.8)
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a non-black person as black, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making this identification, which can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
