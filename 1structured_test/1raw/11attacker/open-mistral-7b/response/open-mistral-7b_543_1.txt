Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a black person as black.
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is black, which is given as 0.15 (85% white, 15% black).
- P(B) as the probability that the witness gives a correct identification, which is given as 0.8 (80% correct, 20% error).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B).

Let's substitute the given values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.12, or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being black and the reliability of the witness's identification. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the conditions under which the witness identified the attacker were similar to the conditions on the night of the attack, as stated in the information provided.
