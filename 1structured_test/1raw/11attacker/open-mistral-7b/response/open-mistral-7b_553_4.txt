Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The racial distribution of the city's population: 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as black does not directly correspond to the actual racial distribution of the city's population. The witness's identification could be influenced by their error rate, which is 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can consider the witness's identification as potentially biased and adjust for the error rate:

The witness identified the attacker as black. This could have two possible explanations:

A) The attacker is actually black.
B) The witness made an error and misidentified a white person as black.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, we can assume that 20% of the time when the witness identifies someone as black, it is an error. This means that only 80% of the time when the witness identifies someone as black, they are correct.

Since 15% of the population is black, and the witness's identification could potentially be biased, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black by correcting for the witness's error rate:

Probability that the attacker is black = Witness's correct identification rate * Actual black population rate
                                                    = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                    = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.12 or 12%. However, it is important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's racial identification ability is representative of their performance on that particular night. In reality, the witness's performance could have been influenced by various factors, such as lighting, distance, or distractions, which were not accounted for in this analysis. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as a rough approximation and not a definitive answer.
