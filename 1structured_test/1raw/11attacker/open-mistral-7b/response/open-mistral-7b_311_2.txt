To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is black, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A | B): Probability of A given B
- P(B | A): Likelihood of B given A (witness's error rate)
- P(A): Prior probability of A (population proportion)
- P(B): Prior probability of B (not relevant for this calculation)

Since we are interested in P(A | B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified the attacker as black, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A means not A, or the attacker is not black.

We are given that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is black)
- P(B | A) = 0.2 (witness error rate for black people)
- P(B | ¬A) = 0.8 (witness error rate for white people)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (the attacker is white)

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(A | B) = (0.2 * 0.15) / (0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)

Calculating the value, we find:

P(A | B) ≈ 0.11

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 11%.
