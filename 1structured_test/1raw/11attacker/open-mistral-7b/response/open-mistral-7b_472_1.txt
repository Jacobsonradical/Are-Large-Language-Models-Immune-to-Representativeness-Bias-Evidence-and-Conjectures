To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is black (which we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the question as 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the question as 0.2)
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified a black person (which we want to find)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We are given values for P(A) (85%), P(B|A) (0.8), and P(B|~A) (0.2). To find P(A|B), we can substitute these values into the equation:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.27

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 27%.
