Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is black:

1. The racial demographics of the city (85% white, 15% black).
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify race under the given conditions (correctly identifies race 80% of the time, errs 20% of the time).

Since we don't know the exact number of errors made by the witness in this case, we can't directly use the second piece of information to estimate the probability. However, we can still make an estimation based on the racial demographics of the city.

If the attacker was white (the majority race), the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as black would be lower than if the attacker was black (the minority race). Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, there's an increased likelihood that the attacker actually is black based on the city's racial demographics.

Therefore, our best estimate would be close to the 15% black population rate in the city. However, without more specific information, we can't provide a more precise probability.
