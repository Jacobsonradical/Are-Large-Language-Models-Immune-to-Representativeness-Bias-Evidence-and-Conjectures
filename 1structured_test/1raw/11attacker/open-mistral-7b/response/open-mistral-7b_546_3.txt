Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being black, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, the events are:
- A: The attacker is black
- B: The witness identified the attacker as black

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so 15% must be black)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time)

The probability of any event not happening is its complement, so P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

We don't have enough information to calculate P(B), so we can't use the full form of Bayes' theorem. Instead, we can use the Bayes' theorem for binary classification, which is a special case of Bayes' theorem for two events:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating that, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.17
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
