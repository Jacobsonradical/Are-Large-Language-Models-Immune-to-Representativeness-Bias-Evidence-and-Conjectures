To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event A (in this case, the attacker is black) given some evidence B (in this case, the witness's statement).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

We have the following information:
- P(B|A) is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the race 80% of the time when the person was black)
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being black, which we want to estimate
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the statement they made, given the attacker's race. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness making this statement when the attacker is black and when the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness making the statement when the attacker is white is 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the race 20% of the time when the person was white).

So, P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A) = unknown (the probability we want to estimate)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness making the statement when the attacker is white)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - x (where x is the probability of the attacker being black)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x)

We can rewrite this equation in terms of x:
0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x) = P(B)

We are given that P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is white and 15% is black). So we have:
0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x) = 0.85

Solving for x gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is black.

The solution is approximately 0.18 (or 18%).

So, {probability: 0.18} is our estimate. This means that there is an estimated 18% chance that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement and the racial distribution in the city.
