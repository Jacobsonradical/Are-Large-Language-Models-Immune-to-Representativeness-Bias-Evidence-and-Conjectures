Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution of the city, as stated in point "a". The city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. The reliability of the witness's racial identification, as stated in point "b". The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between these two pieces of information. The first piece tells us the racial composition of the city, but it does not necessarily mean that the attacker is randomly selected from the city population. The second piece tells us how well the witness can identify races, but it does not tell us whether the witness's identification is accurate or not in this specific case.

Given that we cannot determine whether the witness is correct in this case, we should consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is wrong.

If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed black, and the probability of this is equal to the probability of picking a black person from the city population, which is 15%.

If the witness is wrong, then the attacker is actually white, despite the witness's identification to the contrary. The probability of this is equal to the probability of picking a white person from the city population and then having the witness erroneously identify the person as black. This probability can be calculated as follows:

1. The probability of picking a white person from the city population is 85%.
2. Given that the witness picks a white person, the probability of the witness erring and misidentifying this person as black is 20%.

So, the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being white is 85% * 20% = 0.17 or 17%.

Since we cannot determine whether the witness is correct or wrong, we should consider both possibilities and calculate their probabilities as follows:

Probability of the attacker being black = Probability of the witness being correct * Probability of picking a black person from the city population
                                                         = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                         = 0.12 or 12%

Probability of the attacker being white = Probability of the witness being wrong * Probability of picking a white person from the city population * Probability of the witness identifying this white person as black
                                                          = 0.2 * 0.85 * 0.2
                                                          = 0.034 or 3.4%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 12%, and the probability that the attacker is white is 3.4%. This estimate takes into account both the racial composition of the city and the reliability of the witness's racial identification.
