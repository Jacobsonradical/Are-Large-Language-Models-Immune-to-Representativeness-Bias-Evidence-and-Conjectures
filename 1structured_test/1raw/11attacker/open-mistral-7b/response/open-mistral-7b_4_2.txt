Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is black. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is black
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as black

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black, which we want to find
- P(E|H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black. This is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black. This is given as 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being black in the population. This is given as 0.15 (85% of the population is white, so the attacker must be black 15% of the time)
- P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker being not black in the population. This is given as 0.85 (since P(H) + P(~H) = 1)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.296

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 29.6%.
