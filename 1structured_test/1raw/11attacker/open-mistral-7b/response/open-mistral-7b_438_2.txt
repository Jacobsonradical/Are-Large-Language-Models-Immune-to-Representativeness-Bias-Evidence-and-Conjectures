Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The city's population composition is 85% white and 15% black.

Let's assume that the witness's error rate is uniformly distributed across races (which might not be the case, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity). In this case, the attacker being misidentified as black would happen with a probability of 20% (the error rate).

However, we know that the actual proportion of black people in the city is 15%. If the witness's error rate were uniform, then we would expect to see a misidentification rate of 20% for both races. But in this case, the witness is consistently misidentifying more black people than white people.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying black people as white, rather than the other way around. If we adjust the error rate to reflect this bias, we might expect the actual probability of the attacker being black to be higher than 15%.

Without more specific information about the bias in the witness's error rate, it's not possible to provide a precise probability. However, a reasonable estimate might be somewhere between 15% and 80% (the uncorrected probability plus the error rate).

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: between 0.15 and 0.8, please adjust the estimate based on more specific information about the witness's bias}
