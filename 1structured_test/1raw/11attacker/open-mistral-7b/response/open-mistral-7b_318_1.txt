Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information about the specific context of the witness's identification in this case.

Assuming that the witness's performance is independent in each case and follows a binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that they identified the attacker as black.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that they identified the attacker as black, is the probability of correctly identifying a black person, which is 0.8, according to the information provided.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's race, we don't have enough information to calculate the actual probability that the attacker is black. The witness's identification only gives us a probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested format. The question seems to be missing some crucial information.
