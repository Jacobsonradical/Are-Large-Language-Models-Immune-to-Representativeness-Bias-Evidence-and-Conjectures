Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black. This means the witness made an error in this particular case.

Given that the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black, it would intuitively seem that the attacker is more likely to be white. But we must consider the witness's error.

If we assume that the witness's mistakes are random and occur with an equal probability for both races (which is not necessarily the case, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity), then the witness's error rate can be seen as a correction factor for the bias in their observations.

So, in this case, the witness's incorrect identification of the attacker as black can be seen as a correction towards the black population proportion. To account for this, we subtract the witness's error rate from the population proportion of black people in the city.

The probability estimate for the attacker being black would then be the corrected population proportion.

So, {probability: 0.15 - 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%}

However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis. The witness's error rate might not be uniform across both races, and other factors might influence the likelihood of the attacker being black or white. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation and not as a definitive answer.
