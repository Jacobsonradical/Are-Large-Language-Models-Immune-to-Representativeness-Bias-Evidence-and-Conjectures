Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being black (given in the first piece of information: 15% = 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person (given in the second piece of information: 80% = 0.8)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (given in the second piece of information: 20% = 0.2)
- P(not A) as the probability of the attacker being white (given in the first piece of information: 85% = 0.85)

The witness's identification of the attacker as black gives us the evidence B. Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.23

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 23%.
