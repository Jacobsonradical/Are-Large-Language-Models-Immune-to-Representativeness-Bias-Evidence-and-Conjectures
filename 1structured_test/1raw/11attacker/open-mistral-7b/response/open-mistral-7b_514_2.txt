Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being black using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is black) given the evidence (the witness's identification).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. In this case, we don't have this information directly, but we can estimate it based on the city's population. Since 15% of the population is black, P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2. Therefore, P(E) = 1 - P(E|~H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge race is independent of the attacker's race, which might not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
