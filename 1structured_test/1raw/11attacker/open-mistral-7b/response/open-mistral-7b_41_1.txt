Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population of the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying races (correctly identifies 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time) has identified the attacker as black.

The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's identification. To estimate this, we need to consider both the true probability of the attacker being black (from the city's demographics) and the chance that the witness made a mistake in identifying the attacker's race.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(B) and the probability that the witness is mistaken as P(M). According to the witness's performance, P(M) = 0.2 (since the witness was incorrect 20% of the time).

The witness has identified the attacker as black. This means either the attacker is actually black (B) or the witness made a mistake (M). The probability of these two events is:

P(B) + P(M) = 1 (Since the probability of all possible events must add up to 1)

We know that P(M) = 0.2, so P(B) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

However, we cannot directly use this value of P(B) as the estimated probability of the attacker being black, because we are considering the witness's identification, not the actual population demographics.

The witness correctly identified a black person as black 80% of the time. So, if the actual probability of the attacker being black is P(B), then the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as black is 0.8 * P(B).

We also know that the witness incorrectly identified a white person as black 20% of the time. So, if the actual probability of the attacker being white is 1 - P(B), then the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black is 0.2 * (1 - P(B)).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the total probability of this event is:

0.8 * P(B) + 0.2 * (1 - P(B))

We are looking for an estimate of P(B), so we can solve this equation for P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * P(B) - 0.2 * (1 - P(B))) / 0.8

Simplifying the equation:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(B) + 0.16

0.16 = 0.2 * (1 - P(B))

0.16 = 0.2 * P(B)

P(B) = 0.16 / 0.2 = 0.8

However, we know that P(B) must be between 0 and 1. Since our calculation resulted in 0.8, which is within the acceptable range, we can accept this as our estimate.

So, {probability: 0.8} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black, given the information provided.
