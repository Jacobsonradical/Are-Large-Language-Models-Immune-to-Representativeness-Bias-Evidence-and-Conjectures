Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence E is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the event multiplied by the prior probability of the event.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being black, and the evidence E is the witness's identification of the attacker as black.

The prior probability of the attacker being black is given as 15% (0.15). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is given as 80% (0.8), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white is given as 20% (0.2).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is the complement of the probability of correctly identifying a white person as white, which is given as 85% (0.85). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person as white is therefore 15% (0.15).

The likelihood ratio is therefore the probability of the witness making the identified observation (the attacker being black) given that the attacker is black (0.8), divided by the probability of the witness making the same observation given that the attacker is white (0.15 \* 0.2 = 0.03).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification is therefore (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.03 \* 0.85)) = 0.24.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.24 or 24%.
