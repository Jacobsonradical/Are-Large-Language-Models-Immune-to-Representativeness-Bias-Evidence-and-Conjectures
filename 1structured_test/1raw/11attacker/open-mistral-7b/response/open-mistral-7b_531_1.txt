To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify race and the racial composition of the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population is white, and 15% is black.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker and made a guess based on perception. In this case, we can treat the witness's observations as independent events, and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black is the product of the probability of the attacker being black and the witness's accuracy in identifying black people.

Let's denote:
- P(black) as the probability that the attacker is black.
- P(white) as the probability that the attacker is white.
- P(correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person.
- P(incorrect) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white.

We know that P(black) + P(white) = 1 and P(black) = 0.15 (given in the problem).

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(incorrect) = 0.2.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(correct) = 1 - P(incorrect) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is black is the conditional probability P(black | witness_identifies_black).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(black | witness_identifies_black) = P(witness_identifies_black | black) * P(black) / P(witness_identifies_black)

We know:
- P(witness_identifies_black | black) = P(correct) = 0.8
- P(witness_identifies_black | white) = P(incorrect) = 0.2
- P(black) = 0.15

To calculate P(witness_identifies_black), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness_identifies_black) = P(witness_identifies_black | black) * P(black) + P(witness_identifies_black | white) * P(white)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(witness_identifies_black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(black | witness_identifies_black):

P(black | witness_identifies_black) = P(witness_identifies_black | black) * P(black) / P(witness_identifies_black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.275

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.275, or 27.5%.
