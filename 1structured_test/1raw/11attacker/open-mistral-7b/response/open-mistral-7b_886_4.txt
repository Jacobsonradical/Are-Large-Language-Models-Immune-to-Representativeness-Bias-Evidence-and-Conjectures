Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being black) based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- Θ: The true population distribution of races in the city
- E: The witness's statement

We are given Θ = (0.85, 0.15), the prior probability of H, and P(E|H) = 0.8, the likelihood of the witness's statement given that H is true. We also know P(E|~H) = 0.2, the likelihood of the witness's statement given that H is false.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this probability gives us:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.1587 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 15.87%.
