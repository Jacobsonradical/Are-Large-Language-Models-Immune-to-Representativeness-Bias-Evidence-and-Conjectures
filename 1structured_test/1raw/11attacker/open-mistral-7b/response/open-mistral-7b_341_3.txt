To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying race and the racial demographics of the city.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the times. Since we don't have enough information about how often the witness incorrectly identifies a black person as white, we'll assume that the error rates for both races are equal (20%).

Given that 85% of the population is white, the probability of the witness encountering a white person is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a white person is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (68%).

Since the witness errs 20% of the times, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a black person as white. Since the error rates for both races are equal, this probability is also 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03 (3%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

0.80 * 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.123 (12.3%)

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's identification is independent of the actual race of the attacker. Given that the witness saw the attacker from behind, this might not be the case. If the witness's identification is not independent, the actual probability of the attacker being black might be different from 12.3%.

Without more information, it's difficult to provide a more accurate estimate. Therefore, the best estimate based on the given information is:

{probability: 0.123, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
