Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the racial demographics of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying race.

1. The racial demographics of the city are 85% white and 15% black.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying race, but they err 20% of the time.

Since we cannot rely on the witness's identification due to its potential inaccuracy and the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's race, we should use the racial demographics of the city as our best estimate.

Therefore, {probability: 0.15, the attacker is likely 15% black} is our estimate, given that we cannot rely on the witness's identification. This estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker's race is randomly distributed in the city population.
