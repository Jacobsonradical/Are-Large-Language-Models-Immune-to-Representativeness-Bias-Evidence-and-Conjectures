To estimate the probability that the attacker is black, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the racial distribution of the population. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's race 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is black.

Let's assume that the witness sees the attacker and makes a guess. The probability of the witness guessing correctly that the attacker is black is 1 - 0.20 (the error rate) = 0.80 (or 80%). However, since the witness incorrectly identifies people as black 20% of the time, we need to account for these false positives.

In a city where 85% of the population is white and 15% is black, the witness will incorrectly identify a white person as black 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the time. This means that out of the 15% of the population that is actually black, the witness will incorrectly identify 0.17 * 0.15 = 0.0255 (or 2.55%) as black.

Adding this to the 80% of times the witness correctly identifies a black person, we get a total probability of the attacker being black of 0.80 + 0.0255 = 0.8255 (or 82.55%).

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can round this down to 0.82 (or 82%).

{probability: 0.82}
