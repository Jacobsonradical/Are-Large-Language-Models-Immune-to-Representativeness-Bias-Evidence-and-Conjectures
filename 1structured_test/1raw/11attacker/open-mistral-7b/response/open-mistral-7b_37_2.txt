Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% white and 15% black.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in identifying races, correctly identified the race 80% of the time and incorrectly identified it 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as black.

Given the imperfect nature of the witness's ability to identify races, it's not necessarily a strong indication that the attacker is indeed black. We can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification of a black person (given that the attacker is actually black) and the probability of the witness making a mistake (given that the attacker is actually white).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8 (as stated in the information). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is the probability of a white person being mistakenly identified, which is 0.2 * 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is white) = 0.17.

The total probability of the witness identifying a person as black is therefore the sum of these two probabilities: 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

However, since we don't know if the attacker is actually black or not, we need to consider both possibilities. The probability of the attacker being black is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (given that the attacker is actually black) divided by the total probability of the witness identifying a person as black: 0.8 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.816.

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.816 (or 81.6%).
