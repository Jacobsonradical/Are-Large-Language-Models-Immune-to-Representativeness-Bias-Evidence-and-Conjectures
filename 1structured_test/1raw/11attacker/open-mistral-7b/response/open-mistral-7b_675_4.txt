Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify race is 80% with an error rate of 20%. However, we don't have any information about how accurate the witness's identification was in this specific case.

Assuming the witness's identification is representative of their usual performance, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being black based on the overall racial demographics of the city. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is white and 15% is black.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is indeed black, considering the city's demographics, would be the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15 or 15%.

However, considering the witness's ability to correctly identify race, we could make a more refined estimate. If we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying a black person as white and an incorrectly identifying a white person as black, then we can adjust the city's demographic proportion to account for this.

Given that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, this means they erred 20% of the time. If they err 20% of the time, then they must be correct 80% of the time. Therefore, for every 4 times the witness identifies a person as black, they is actually black 3 times and mistaken 1 time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as black, this means they are likely correct 3 out of 4 times. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is black, considering the witness's performance, would be 0.75 or 75%.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on assumptions and the actual probability may be different. The most accurate estimate would require more information, such as the results of a DNA test or other forensic evidence.
