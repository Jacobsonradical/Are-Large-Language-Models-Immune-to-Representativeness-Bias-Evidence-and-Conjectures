Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being black, and event B is the witness's identification of a black person.

The prior probability of the attacker being black (P(A)) is given by the population demographics, which is 15% (0.15).

The probability of the witness identifying a black person given that the attacker is black (P(B|A)) is given as 80% (0.8).

The probability of the witness identifying a black person given that the attacker is white (P(B|not A)) is given as 20% (0.2).

The probability of the witness making an identification (P(B)) is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.85 (or 85%).

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification (P(A|B)) is P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.85) = 0.16 (or 16%).

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the provided information. If the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's race under conditions similar to that night and found that the witness correctly identified race 80% of the time, then the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification should be higher than 16%. It is unclear how the witness's accuracy rate of 80% can be reconciled with the population demographics of 85% white and 15% black, and this contradiction should be resolved before attempting to estimate the probability of the attacker being black.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer to your question, as the information provided appears to be inconsistent.
