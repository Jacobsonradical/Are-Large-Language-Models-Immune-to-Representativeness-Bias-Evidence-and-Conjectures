Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% when the person is black and 85% of the population in the city is white. We can assume that the attacker could have been either black or white.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time when the person was actually white. Given that 85% of the population is white, this means that the witness mistakenly identified a white person as black 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time when the attacker was actually black, and mistakenly identified a white person as black 17% of the time, the total probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker is 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97 or 97%.

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the racial demographics of the city, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is {probability: 0.97, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. However, it's important to note that this estimate is dependent on the witness's accuracy and the racial demographics of the city, and other factors may influence the actual probability.
