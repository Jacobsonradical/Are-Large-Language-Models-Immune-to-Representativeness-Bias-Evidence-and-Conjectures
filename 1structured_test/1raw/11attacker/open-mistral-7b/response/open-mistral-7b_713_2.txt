Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's race is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% white and 15% black.

However, since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as black, we need to account for this error in our calculation. The probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's mistake, is the inverse of the probability of the witness making such a mistake given that the attacker is white.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black is the error rate of 20%. So, the probability of the attacker being white, given the witness's mistake, is 1 - the error rate of 0.8 or 0.2.

But since we want the probability of the attacker being black, we need to find the probability of the witness making such a mistake given that the attacker is black. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person is 0.8, so the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white is 1 - 0.8 or 0.2.

So, the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's mistake, is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a black person as white divided by the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a white person as black.

Therefore, {probability: 0.2 / 0.2 = 1} or 100% is an incorrect interpretation, but the actual probability is 0.2.

However, we should consider the possibility that there were other witnesses or evidence that could provide a more accurate description of the attacker. In the absence of such information, the best estimate based on the witness's statement alone is 20%.
