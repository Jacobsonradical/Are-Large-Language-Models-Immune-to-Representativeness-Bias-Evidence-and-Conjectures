Given the information provided, we have a witness who is able to correctly identify a person's race 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies it 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as black. However, we don't have any information about the race of the attacker being correct or incorrect in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% white and 15% black. But this information does not directly apply to the witness's identification capability, as the witness's ability to identify race is not necessarily reflective of the city's demographics.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate for the attacker's race. The witness's identification alone does not provide enough information to make a reliable probability estimate.
