Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% white and 15% black. However, a witness who is not perfectly reliable in identifying race has reported seeing a black attacker.

The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether this witness's error in this case was misidentifying a white person as black or the other way around, we should consider both possibilities.

If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed black. The probability of this is 0.15 (15% chance of the attacker being black in the population).

If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is actually white, but the witness mistakenly identified him as black. The probability of this is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.20 (20% chance of error).

So, the total probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's report, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.265, probability estimate: 26.5%}

Therefore, given the witness's report and the known racial distribution of the population, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 26.5%.
