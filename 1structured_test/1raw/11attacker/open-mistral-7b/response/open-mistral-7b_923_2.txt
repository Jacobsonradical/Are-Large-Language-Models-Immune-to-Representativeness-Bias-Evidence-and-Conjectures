Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is black can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is black
- Θ: The race of a random person in the city

From the information given, we have:
P(H|Θ=black) = 1 (since the attacker is assumed to be the same race as the witness identified)
P(Θ=black) = 0.15 (from the statistics of the city)
P(Θ=white) = 0.85 (from the statistics of the city)
P(H|Θ=white) = 0 (since the witness identified the attacker as black)

Now, we need the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a white person as black. This is given as 20% or 0.2. So, P(Θ=white|H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|witness_statement):

P(H|witness_statement) = P(witness_statement|H) * P(H) / (P(witness_statement|H) * P(H) + P(witness_statement|Θ=white) * P(Θ=white))

We know that P(witness_statement|H) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as black)

Now we can calculate P(H|witness_statement):

P(H|witness_statement) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / 0.15 = 1

However, since we cannot have a probability greater than 1, this result suggests that the witness's statement is enough evidence to conclude with certainty that the attacker is black. In a more realistic scenario, we would use a more conservative estimate, considering the uncertainty of the witness's statement.

Considering the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying race, a more realistic estimate of the probability that the attacker is black would be:
