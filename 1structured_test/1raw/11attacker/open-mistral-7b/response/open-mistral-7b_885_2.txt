Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify race is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can use the probability of a correct identification to estimate the probability that the attacker is black.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is black as P(black). Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's race as black is P(black) * 0.8 (given the witness's accuracy rate).

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as black 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is white, P(white), is 1 - P(black). Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's race as black is P(white) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as black, we can set up an equation: P(black) * 0.8 = 1 - P(white) * 0.2

Solving for P(black), we get: P(black) = (1 - P(white) * 0.2) / 0.8 = (1 - 0.16) / 0.8 = 0.84 / 0.8 = 1.05 / 1

However, probabilities must be between 0 and 1, so this result is not valid. This means that the information given is inconsistent or there is some missing information. Therefore, I cannot provide a strict answer to the question.
