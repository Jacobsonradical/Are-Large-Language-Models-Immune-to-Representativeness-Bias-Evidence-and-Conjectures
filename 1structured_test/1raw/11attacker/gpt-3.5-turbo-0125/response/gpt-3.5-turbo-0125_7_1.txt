{probability: 0.229} 

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A) = 0.15 (from given information)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from given information)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from given information)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from given information)

Now, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
