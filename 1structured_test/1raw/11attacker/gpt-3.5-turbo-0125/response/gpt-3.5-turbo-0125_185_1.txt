{probability: 0.105} 

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

P(A) = 0.15 (given in the second piece of information)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the first piece of information)
P(B|not A) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / [P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)]
P(A|B) = 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2] = 0.105

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.105 or 10.5%.
