{probability: 0.096, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

Given that the witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time and erroneously identifies race 20% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black, is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identified attacker as black) = (P(Witness identified attacker as black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)) / P(Witness identified attacker as black)

Plugging in the values:
P(Attacker is black | Witness identified attacker as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.096

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.096 or 9.6%.
