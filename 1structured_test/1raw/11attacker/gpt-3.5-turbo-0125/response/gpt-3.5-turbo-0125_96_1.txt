{probability: 0.664} 

To calculate this estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is black and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness correctly identifies race as black)
P(A) = 0.15 (Probability that attacker is black)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

Now we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.664

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is 0.664.
