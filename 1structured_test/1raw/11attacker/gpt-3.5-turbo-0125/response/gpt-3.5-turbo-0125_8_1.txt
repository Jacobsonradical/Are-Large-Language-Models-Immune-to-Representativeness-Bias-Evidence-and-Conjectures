{probability: 0.364} 

To calculate the probability that the attacker is black, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is black)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (probability that the witness erroneously identifies a white person as black)
P(A') = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is white)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(A) * P(W|A) / [P(A) * P(W|A) + P(A') * P(W|A')]
= 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138.
