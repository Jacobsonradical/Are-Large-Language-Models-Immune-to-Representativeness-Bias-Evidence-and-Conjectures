{probability: 0.448} 

To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. 

P(A) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being black)
P(~A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being white)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability witness correctly identifies a black person)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (probability witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / [P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A)] 
         = 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]
         = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
         = 0.12 / 0.29
         â‰ˆ 0.448

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.448.
