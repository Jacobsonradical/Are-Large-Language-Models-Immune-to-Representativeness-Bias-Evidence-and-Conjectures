{probability: 0.563, my estimate is 0.563} 

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.563

So, the probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black, is approximately 0.563.
