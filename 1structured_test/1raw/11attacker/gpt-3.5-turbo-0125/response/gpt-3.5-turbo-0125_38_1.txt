{probability: 0.572, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is black, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414 

Based on this calculation, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.572.
