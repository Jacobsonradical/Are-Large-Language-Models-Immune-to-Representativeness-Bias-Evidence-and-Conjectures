{probability: 0.344, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability of the attacker being black (0.15), 
P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.5), 
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person (0.8), 
P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black.

We can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.24
Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.24 or 24%.
