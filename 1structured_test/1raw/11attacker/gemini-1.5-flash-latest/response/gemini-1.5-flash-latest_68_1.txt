This is a classic example of how our intuitions about probability can be misleading, and how applying Bayes' Theorem can lead to a more accurate assessment. Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior probability:** The attacker is more likely to be white (85%) due to the population demographics.
* **Likelihood:** The witness has a certain accuracy in identifying race under similar conditions.

We want to calculate the **posterior probability** – the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
* P(A) is the prior probability of A
* P(B) is the prior probability of B (we'll address this later)

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black
* B: The witness identifies the attacker as black

**Calculations**

1. **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15
2. **P(B|A):** Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
3. **P(B|not A):** Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is white = 0.20 (witness error rate)
4. **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being white = 0.85

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be done using the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**Calculating the Posterior Probability:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Notes:**

* This is a probabilistic estimate. It doesn't definitively prove the attacker's race.
* The accuracy of the witness's testimony is crucial in this calculation.
* This problem highlights the importance of considering both prior probabilities and likelihoods when evaluating evidence.
