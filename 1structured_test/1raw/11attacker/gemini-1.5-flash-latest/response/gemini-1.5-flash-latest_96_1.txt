This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to a real-world scenario. Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**Given Information:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from population demographics) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (accuracy rate) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (false positive rate) = 0.20
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black.

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as black, is approximately 41.4%. This is higher than the base population percentage of black individuals (15%), but it's still significantly less than a 50/50 chance.
