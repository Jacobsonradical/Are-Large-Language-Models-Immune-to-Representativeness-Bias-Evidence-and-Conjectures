Here's how we can estimate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(B) = 0.15 (Probability of a black attacker based on the city's population)
* P(W) = 0.85 (Probability of a white attacker based on the city's population)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(I|B) = 0.80 (Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black)
* P(I|W) = 0.20 (Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually white)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.353

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.353} 

**Explanation:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the fact that the witness is not perfectly accurate in identifying race and the majority of the population is white, significantly reduces the probability of the attacker actually being black.
