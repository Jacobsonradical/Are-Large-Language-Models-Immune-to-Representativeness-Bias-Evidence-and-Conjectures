Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a situation where we're trying to determine the probability of an event (the attacker being black) given some evidence. This is a classic case for Bayes' Theorem.

**Setting Up the Variables**

* **A:** The event that the attacker is black.
* **B:** The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (from the witness's accuracy). 
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black (from the city's population demographics).
* P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (this is a bit more complex to calculate, but we'll get there).

**Calculating the Values**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80**  (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time).
* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the city's population is black).

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider both scenarios: the attacker being black and the attacker being white.

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is black**
    * Probability of attacker being black: 0.15
    * Probability of witness correctly identifying them as black: 0.80
    * Probability of this scenario: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2: Attacker is white**
    * Probability of attacker being white: 0.85
    * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying them as black: 0.20
    * Probability of this scenario: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

* **P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29** (The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black)

**Putting it all together**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
