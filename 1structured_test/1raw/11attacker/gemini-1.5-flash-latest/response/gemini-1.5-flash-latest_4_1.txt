This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem being applied to a real-world situation. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **A:** Event that the attacker is black.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**Given Information**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from population data) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (true positive rate) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are not black (false positive rate) = 0.20 
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black (from population data) = 0.85

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B) which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
P(B) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the probability of the attacker being black is approximately 41%.
