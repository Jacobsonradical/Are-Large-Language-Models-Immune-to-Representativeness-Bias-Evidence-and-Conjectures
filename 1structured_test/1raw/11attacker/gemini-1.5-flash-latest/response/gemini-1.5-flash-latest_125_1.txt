Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race under similar conditions. 
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define:

*  A = Attacker is black
*  B = Witness identified the attacker as black

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being black given the witness said so.
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is black, and the witness correctly identifies them.  Probability = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black. Probability = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's accuracy is consistent across all individuals. In reality, factors like lighting, distance, and individual differences can influence witness accuracy.
