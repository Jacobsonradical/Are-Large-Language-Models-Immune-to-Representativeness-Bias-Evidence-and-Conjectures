Here's how we can calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We are given:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Probability of a person in the city being black)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Probability of a person in the city being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.8** (Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black)
* **P(I|W) = 0.2** (Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually white)

**We want to find P(B|I) - the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.30

**P(B|I) = 0.4**

**Therefore: {probability: 0.4}**
