This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break it down:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:**  The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as black, given they are black (from the 80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black, given they are not black (from the 20% error rate).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (from the population demographics).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**Let's calculate:**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now, we can find P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.4615.**

**Answer: {probability: 0.4615}**
