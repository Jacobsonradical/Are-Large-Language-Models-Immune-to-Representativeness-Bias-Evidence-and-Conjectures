Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayes' Theorem. We need to update our prior belief (the percentage of Black people in the city) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is Black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as Black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is Black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as Black given that the attacker is actually Black. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being Black, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as Black.  This is a bit trickier and requires the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as Black, which is 20% (0.2).
    * P(not A): The probability of the attacker not being Black, which is 85% (0.85).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Interpretation**

The probability that the attacker is Black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 46%.  While the witness's testimony increases the probability from the initial 15%, it's important to remember that there's still a significant chance the attacker is not Black.
