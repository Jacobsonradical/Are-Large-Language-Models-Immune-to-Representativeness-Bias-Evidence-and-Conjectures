Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. 

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability that the attacker is black is 15% based on the city's population demographics.
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race, given the conditions of the attack.
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability that the attacker is black after considering the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define the events:

*  A: Attacker is black
*  B: Witness identifies the attacker as black

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black (what we want to find)
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (80% accuracy)
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being black (15%)
* P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. This requires considering both cases: 
    * Witness correctly identifies a black attacker (80% * 15%)
    * Witness incorrectly identifies a white attacker as black (20% * 85%)

**Calculations**

1. **P(B):** 
   * (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B):** 
   * (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Explanation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.  This is significantly higher than the initial probability of 15%, but still less than 50%.  It highlights that while the witness's testimony is informative, it's important to consider the witness's error rate and the overall demographics of the city.
