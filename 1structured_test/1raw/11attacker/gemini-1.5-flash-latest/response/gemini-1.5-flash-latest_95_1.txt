This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and witness testimony can be combined to estimate a posterior probability. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The percentage of black people in the city (15%) represents the prior probability of the attacker being black.
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race (80% correct) is the likelihood of observing the witness's testimony if the attacker is actually black.
* **Posterior Probability:** We want to find the probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing B given A (the witness's accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of A (the proportion of black people in the city).
* P(B) is the probability of observing B (the evidence), which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

**Calculations**

1. **Let's define our events:**
   * A: The attacker is black.
   * B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

2. **We know:**
   * P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being black)
   * P(B|A) = 0.80 (likelihood of witness correctly identifying a black person)
   * P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (likelihood of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black) 
   * P(¬A) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being white)

3. **Calculate P(B) (using the law of total probability):**
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
   P(A|B) ≈ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is black increases from 15% to approximately 41%. However, it's crucial to remember that this is still a relatively low probability, and the witness's testimony, despite being considered reliable, is not definitive.
