This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Given Information**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's demographics).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black, given they are black.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black, given they are not black.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black, which is what we want to find.

To find P(B), we need the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**4. Calculation**

* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability of the attacker not being black.
* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
