This is a classic example of Bayesian reasoning and how our prior beliefs can influence our conclusions. Here's how to approach the problem:

**Understanding the Terms**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (witness statement) given a particular event (attacker's race).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we're trying to calculate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A (attacker is black) given event B (witness statement).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness statement if the attacker is black (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness statement (we'll calculate this below).

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate the probability of the witness statement (P(B)), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is Black:**  
   * P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.80
   * P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is White:**
   * P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) = 0.20 
   * P(Attacker is White) = 0.85

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] + [P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                          = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness statement, is approximately 41.4%. Even though the witness was accurate 80% of the time, the high proportion of white people in the city makes the initial prior probability important, and the posterior probability remains below 50%.
