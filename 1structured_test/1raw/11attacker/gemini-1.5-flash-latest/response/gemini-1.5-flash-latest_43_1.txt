Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're trying to find the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's identification. This is a classic example of applying Bayesian reasoning, where we update our prior belief (the population demographics) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

**Setting up the Variables**

* Let B represent the event "the attacker is black."
* Let W represent the event "the witness identified the attacker as black."

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(B|W) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.
* P(W|B) is the probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* P(B) is the prior probability the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics (15%).
* P(W) is the probability the witness identifies someone as black, regardless of their actual race. This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(W)**

To get P(W), we need to consider both scenarios: the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person:

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
P(W) = 0.29

**Calculating P(B|W)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation**

Even though the witness is relatively accurate, the fact that the city's population is predominantly white means that the probability the attacker is black is still less than 50% despite the witness's testimony. This demonstrates how prior probabilities can influence our judgments.
