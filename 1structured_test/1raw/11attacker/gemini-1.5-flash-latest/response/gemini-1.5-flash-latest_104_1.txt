This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and evidence can be combined to form a more accurate posterior probability. Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being black is simply the proportion of black people in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "black" given attacker is black:** 80% (witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "black" given attacker is white:** 20% (witness is wrong)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence:

```
P(Attacker is Black | Witness said Black) = 
[P(Witness said Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / 
P(Witness said Black)
```

To calculate P(Witness said Black), we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(Witness said Black) = [P(Witness said Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] + [P(Witness said Black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White)]
* P(Witness said Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker is Black | Witness said Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                         = 0.4138
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only around 41.38%. This is because the witness is not always accurate in identifying race, and the prior probability of a black person in the city is relatively low.
