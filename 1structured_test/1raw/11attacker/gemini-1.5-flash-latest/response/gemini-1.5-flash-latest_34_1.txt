This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Let's define our events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We know the following:**

* **P(W|B):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black given they are black = 0.8 (80%)
* **P(W|¬B):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are not black = 0.2 (20%)
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (15%)
* **P(¬B):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85 (85%)

**We want to find P(B|W):** The probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.30 
P(B|W) = 0.4

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.4.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
