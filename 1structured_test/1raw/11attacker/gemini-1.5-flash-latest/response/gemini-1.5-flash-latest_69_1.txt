This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by base rates and the way we process information. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the correct probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Base Rate:** The base rate of black individuals in the city is 15%. This is important because it represents the prior probability of the attacker being black before considering any other information.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness identified the attacker as black, but their accuracy is not perfect. They are correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony. Here's how it works:

* **P(Black | Witness):** Probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness | Black):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black. This is 80% (witness accuracy).
* **P(Black):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (base rate). This is 15%.
* **P(Witness):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is a bit more complex and needs to account for both correct and incorrect identifications. 

To calculate P(Witness), we need to consider the two scenarios where the witness might say "black":

1. **Correctly identifying a black person:**  P(Witness | Black) * P(Black) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **Incorrectly identifying a white person:** P(Witness | White) * P(White) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(Witness) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Black | Witness) = [P(Witness | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness)
P(Black | Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(Black | Witness) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}

**Important Note:** Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is still significantly lower than the witness's claim might suggest. This is because the base rate of black individuals in the city is lower than the witness's accuracy rate.
