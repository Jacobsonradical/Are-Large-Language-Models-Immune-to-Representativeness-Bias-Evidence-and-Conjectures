Here's how to calculate the probability, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is black.
*  Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (The prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population)
*  P(¬A) = 0.85 (The prior probability of the attacker not being black)

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are black)
*  P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given they are not black)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.412

**Answer:** {probability: 0.412}
