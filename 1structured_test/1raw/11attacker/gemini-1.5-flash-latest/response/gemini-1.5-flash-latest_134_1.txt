Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Terms**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (the percentage of black people in the city).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (the witness's identification) given a specific hypothesis (the attacker is black or white).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) after considering the new evidence (witness identification).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define:

* **B:**  Event that the attacker is black.
* **W:**  Event that the attacker is white.
* **I:**  Event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|I), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

Let's break down each term:

* **P(I|B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black. This is 80% (the witness's accuracy in identifying black people).
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15%.
* **P(I|W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is white. This is 20% (the witness's error rate in identifying white people as black).
* **P(W):** Prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 85%.

**Calculation**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation provides an estimate based on the given information. In reality, many other factors could influence the actual probability, such as the witness's overall reliability and potential biases.
