This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and evidence can be combined using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  A: The attacker is black.
*  B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A): The probability that the attacker is black (from information 'a') = 0.15 
*  P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is not black = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from information 'b'):**

*  P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (correct identification) = 0.80
*  P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (incorrect identification) = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Interpretation:**  Despite the witness identifying the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is only about 41.4%. This highlights the importance of considering the accuracy of eyewitness testimony and the base rate of the population.
