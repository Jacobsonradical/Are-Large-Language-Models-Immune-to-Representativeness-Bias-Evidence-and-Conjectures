This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misleading when dealing with probabilities, and it highlights the importance of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability that the attacker is black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is not black (white) = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black (true positive rate) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually white (false positive rate) = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.41}

**Important Note:** Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is only about 41%. This is because the witness's accuracy is not perfect, and the initial probability of the attacker being black is relatively low due to the city's demographics.
