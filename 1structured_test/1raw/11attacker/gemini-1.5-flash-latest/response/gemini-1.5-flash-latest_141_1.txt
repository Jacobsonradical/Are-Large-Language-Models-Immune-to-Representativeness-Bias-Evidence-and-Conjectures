Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define:**

* **B:**  Event that the attacker is black.
* **W:** Event that the attacker is white.
* **I:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We know:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being black based on population demographics)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(I|W) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

**We want to find P(B|I):** The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
