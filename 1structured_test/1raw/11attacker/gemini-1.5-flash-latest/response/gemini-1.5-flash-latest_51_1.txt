This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.
* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is black (15% or 0.15).
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% or 0.8).
* **Likelihood (P(B|not A)):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are not black (20% or 0.2).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black (what we want to find).
* P(B): The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black.

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person:

* P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Interpretation**

This means that given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 46%.
