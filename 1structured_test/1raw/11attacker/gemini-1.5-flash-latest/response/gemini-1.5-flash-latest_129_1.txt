This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by base rates.  We need to use Bayes' Theorem to accurately calculate the probability.

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Let's define events:**
    *  B: The attacker is black.
    *  W: The attacker is white.
    *  I: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

* **We know the following probabilities:**
    *  P(B) = 0.15 (Prior probability of a person being black in the city)
    *  P(W) = 0.85 (Prior probability of a person being white in the city)
    *  P(I|B) = 0.8 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black if they are actually black)
    *  P(I|W) = 0.2 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black if they are actually white)

* **We want to find P(B|I):**  The probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem:**
P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**
P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)
P(I) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(B|I):**
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
