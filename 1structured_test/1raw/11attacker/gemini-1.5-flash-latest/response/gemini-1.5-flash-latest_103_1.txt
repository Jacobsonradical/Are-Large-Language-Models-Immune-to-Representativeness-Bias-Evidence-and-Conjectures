This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (the percentage of the black population in the city).
* **Likelihood:** The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's race in similar conditions.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as black. 

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's identification (B). This is what we want to calculate.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% - the likelihood).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:**  The attacker is black (probability 15%). The witness correctly identifies them as black (probability 80%).
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is white (probability 85%). The witness mistakenly identifies them as black (probability 20%).

P(B) = (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.29

**Calculating the Estimated Probability**

Now we have all the components to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the population demographics, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is approximately 41.4%. This highlights the importance of considering both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of the characteristic in the population when evaluating evidence.
