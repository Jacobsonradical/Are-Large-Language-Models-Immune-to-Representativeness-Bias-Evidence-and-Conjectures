This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem.  Let's break down how to calculate the probability:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from information "a").
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence given a specific hypothesis. Here, the likelihood is the witness's accuracy in identifying someone as black, which is 80% (from information "b").
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the hypothesis being true given the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate: the probability the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

Posterior Probability = (Likelihood * Prior Probability) / (Likelihood * Prior Probability + Likelihood of Other Outcome * Prior Probability of Other Outcome)

**Applying the Formula:**

* **Hypothesis 1:** The attacker is black.
    * Likelihood = 0.8 (witness correctly identifying a black person)
    * Prior Probability = 0.15 (15% of the population is black)
* **Hypothesis 2:** The attacker is white.
    * Likelihood = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
    * Prior Probability = 0.85 (85% of the population is white)

**Calculation:**

Posterior Probability (Attacker is Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
                                          = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                          = 0.12 / 0.29
                                          â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** While this is a mathematically sound estimate, it's crucial to remember that this is still a probability.  It does not definitively prove the attacker was black.  There is still a significant chance the attacker was white.
