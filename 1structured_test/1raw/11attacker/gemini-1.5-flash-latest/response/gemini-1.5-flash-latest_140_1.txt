This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break it down:

**Let's define our events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We know the following:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being black, based on city demographics)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black)
* **P(I|W) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually white)

**We want to find P(B|I):** The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

**Let's calculate:**

* P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}

**In conclusion, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.**
