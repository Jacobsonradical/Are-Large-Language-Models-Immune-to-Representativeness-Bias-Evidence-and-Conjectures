This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break it down:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is based on the city's demographics: 15%
* **Likelihood:** The witness's testimony provides information about how well they can identify race. This is our likelihood function.
* **Posterior Probability:** We want to calculate the probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying the Theorem to our Case**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is black
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black

We know:

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being black)
* **P(B|A):** 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(B|¬A):** 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
* **P(¬A):** 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being white)

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (regardless of the attacker's actual race). We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%. This is higher than the initial 15% probability but still less than 50%. The witness's testimony has increased our belief that the attacker is black, but it's not definitive.
