This is a classic example of how our intuition about probability can be misleading. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the correct answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a prior probability (based on the city's demographics) that the attacker is black (15%). We also have new evidence from the witness, who is not perfect.  We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our probability based on this new information.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about an event (the attacker being black) given new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's identification (B) – what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is tricky and requires calculating the probability of a correct ID and an incorrect ID.

**Calculating P(B)**

* **Correct ID:**  P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Incorrect ID:** P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
* **Total:** P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Notes**

* **The witness's identification is not as strong as it might seem.** Even though they are accurate 80% of the time, the high proportion of white people in the city means their saying "black" is more likely to be a false positive.
* **This is a simplified example.** Real-world situations involve more complex factors, and eyewitness testimony should be treated with caution.
