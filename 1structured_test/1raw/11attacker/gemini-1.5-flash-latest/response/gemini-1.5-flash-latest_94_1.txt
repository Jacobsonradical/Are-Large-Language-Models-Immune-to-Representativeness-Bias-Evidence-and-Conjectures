This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics. This is 0.15 (15%).

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, *given* the attacker is black. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, *given* the attacker is not black. This is 0.2 (20% error rate).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is black, *given* the witness identified them as black (what we want to find).
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Calculation**

Now, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Important Note:** This calculation only considers the information provided.  In a real-world investigation, other factors would be considered, and this is not a substitute for a thorough investigation.
