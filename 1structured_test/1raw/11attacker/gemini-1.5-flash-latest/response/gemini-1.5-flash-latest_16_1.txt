This is a classic example of how our brains can be misled by base rates and our intuition about probability. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the correct answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're trying to determine the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's identification. This is a conditional probability problem.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is the tool we need to solve this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Applying the Information to Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Now we can plug in the information:

* **P(A):**  The probability the attacker is black (from the city's demographics) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black (from the witness's accuracy) = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black *given* the attacker is not black (this is the error rate) = 0.20 
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is not black = 0.85

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to find P(B) – the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.  This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

Now we can finally calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:**  Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is significantly lower than the witness's accuracy might suggest. This is because the base rate of black people in the city is much lower than the witness's error rate.
