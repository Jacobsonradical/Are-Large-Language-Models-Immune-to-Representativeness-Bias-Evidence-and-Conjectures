This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Let's define some events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We know the following probabilities:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black)
* **P(I|W) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is white)

**We want to find P(B|I), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
