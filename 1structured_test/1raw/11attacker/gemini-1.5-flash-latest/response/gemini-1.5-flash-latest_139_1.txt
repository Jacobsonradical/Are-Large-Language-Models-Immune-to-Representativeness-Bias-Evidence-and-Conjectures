Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the racial distribution of the city's population (85% white, 15% black).  We also have information about the witness's accuracy in identifying race under similar conditions. We want to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Prior Probability (P(Black)):** The initial probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics (0.15).
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Black | Black)):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is black, given the attacker is actually black (0.80).
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Black | White)):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is black, given the attacker is actually white (0.20). 
* **Posterior Probability (P(Black | Witness Says Black)):** The probability the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as black. This is what we want to calculate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(Black | Witness Says Black) = [P(Witness Says Black | Black) * P(Black)] / 
                                 [P(Witness Says Black | Black) * P(Black) + P(Witness Says Black | White) * P(White)] 
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
P(Black | Witness Says Black) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
                                    = 0.12 / 0.34
                                    = 0.353 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's identification is independent of the attacker's actual race. In reality, there could be biases or other factors influencing the witness's identification.
