Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being black (from information "a") = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker not being black = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (from information "b") = 0.80 
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black = 0.20 (the witness is wrong 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculate:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
