This is a classic example of how to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** Probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** Probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black = 0.80 (from the witness's accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black = 0.20 (from the witness's error rate)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
      = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
      = 0.12 / 0.29 
      ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Interpretation:** 

Given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.  While this is higher than the initial probability of 15%, it's still significantly less than a certainty. It's important to remember that this is just a probability based on the information given and doesn't prove definitively that the attacker was black.
