Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** Attacker is black.
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  Probability of the attacker being black (from information "a") = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Probability of the attacker not being black = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from information "b"):**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (correct identification) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (incorrect identification) = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, calculated as:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculate:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
