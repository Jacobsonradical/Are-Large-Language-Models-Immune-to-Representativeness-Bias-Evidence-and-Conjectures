This is a classic example of how our brains can be tricked by statistics and how easy it is to fall into the trap of confirmation bias. 

Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at a statistically sound answer:

**Understanding Bayes' Theorem**

This problem requires applying Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. 

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **Likelihood:**  The witness correctly identified the attacker as black 80% of the time.
* **Evidence:** The witness claims the attacker was black.

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Let's denote:

* B = Attacker is black
* W = Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|W), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(W|B) = 0.8 (Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker)
* P(B) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being black)
* P(W) =  We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(W)**

P(W) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can happen in two ways:

1. **The attacker is black, and the witness identifies them correctly:** P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **The attacker is white, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as black:** P(W|B') * P(B') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Important Note:** This calculation shows that even with the witness's testimony, the probability of the attacker being black is still less than 50%.  The witness's identification, while helpful, is not definitive due to their error rate.
