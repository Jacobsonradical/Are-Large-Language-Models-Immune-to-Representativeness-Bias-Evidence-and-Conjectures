This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to apply it:

**Let's define some events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We need to find:**  P(B|I), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from the population statistics).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** Prior probability of the attacker being white.
* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** Probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** Probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually white (20% error rate).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.3 
P(B|I) = 0.4
```

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4}
