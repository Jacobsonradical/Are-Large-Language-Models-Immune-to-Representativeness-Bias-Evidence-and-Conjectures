Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% based on the city's population demographics.
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race provides the likelihood of observing the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as black) given different scenarios (attacker actually being black or white).
* **Posterior Probability:**  We want to find the updated probability of the attacker being black after considering the witness's testimony.

**Calculations:**

Let's use the following notation:

*  B: Event that the attacker is black
*  W: Event that the attacker is white
*  S: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We need to calculate P(B|S), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|S) = [P(S|B) * P(B)] / P(S)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(S|B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(B):**  Prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15%.
* **P(S):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(S) = P(S|B) * P(B) + P(S|W) * P(W)
    * P(S|W): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is white. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
    * P(W): Prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 85%.

**Putting it together:**

* P(S) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(B|S) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's actual race. In reality, there could be biases or other factors influencing the witness's perception.
