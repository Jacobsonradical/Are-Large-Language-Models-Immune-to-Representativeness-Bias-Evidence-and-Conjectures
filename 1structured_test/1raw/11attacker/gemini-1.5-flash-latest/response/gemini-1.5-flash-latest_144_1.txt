This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior probability:** The probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony. This is simply the proportion of black people in the city (15%).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80%).
* **Evidence:** The witness's statement that the attacker was black.
* **Posterior probability:** The probability of the attacker being black after considering the witness's testimony. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

The posterior probability is calculated as follows:

```
P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black)] / P(Witness says Black) 
```

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) = 0.8** (likelihood)
* **P(Attacker is Black) = 0.15** (prior probability)
* **P(Witness says Black)** is a bit trickier. We need to consider both cases: the attacker is black, and the attacker is white.  

    * **P(Witness says Black | Attacker is Black) * P(Attacker is Black) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12**
    * **P(Witness says Black | Attacker is White) * P(Attacker is White) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17** 

    * **P(Witness says Black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29** (sum of the probabilities of the two cases)

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.41
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Notes:**

* **This is an estimate:** It's based on the assumptions we've made. In reality, there might be other factors influencing the witness's accuracy, such as stress or other biases.
* **It's not a certainty:**  Even though the probability is higher than the prior probability, it's still not a definitive conclusion. The witness is not always accurate, and there's still a chance the attacker is not black.
