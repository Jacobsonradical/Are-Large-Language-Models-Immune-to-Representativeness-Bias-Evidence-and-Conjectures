This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Let's define some events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We are given:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
* **P(I|W) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

**We want to find P(B|I):**  The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To calculate P(I), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)
P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
