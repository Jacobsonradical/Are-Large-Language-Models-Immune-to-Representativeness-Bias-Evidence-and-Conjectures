Here's how to break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's statement. This is a classic example of how prior information (population demographics) and new evidence (witness testimony) can be combined to update our beliefs.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Problem**

* **Event A:** Attacker is black.
* **Event B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black.

Let's break down each component:

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black is 80% (witness's accuracy).
* **P(B):** This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's race. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

    * **Scenario 1: Attacker is black:** Probability = 0.15 (prior probability of being black) * 0.80 (witness accuracy) = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2: Attacker is white:** Probability = 0.85 (prior probability of being white) * 0.20 (witness error) = 0.17
    * **P(B):** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
