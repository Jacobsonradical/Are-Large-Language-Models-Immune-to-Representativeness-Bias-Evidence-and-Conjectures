Here's how to calculate the probability, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being black is 0.15 (from "a").
* **P(¬A):** The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being white is 0.85 (from "a").

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from "b"):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying a black person as black is 0.80.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying a white person as black is 0.20.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29 
       ≈ 0.414
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
