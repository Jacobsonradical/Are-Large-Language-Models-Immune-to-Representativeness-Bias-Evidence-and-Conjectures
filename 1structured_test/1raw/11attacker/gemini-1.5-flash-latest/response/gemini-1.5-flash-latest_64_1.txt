This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to solve it:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We want to find P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

**We know:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% from the given information).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone being black in the city (15% from the given information).
* **P(B| not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are not black (20% from the given information, since they are correct 80% of the time).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of someone not being black in the city (85% from the given information).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**We need to find P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which can happen in two ways:

* The person is black, and the witness identifies them correctly.
* The person is not black, and the witness identifies them incorrectly.

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
