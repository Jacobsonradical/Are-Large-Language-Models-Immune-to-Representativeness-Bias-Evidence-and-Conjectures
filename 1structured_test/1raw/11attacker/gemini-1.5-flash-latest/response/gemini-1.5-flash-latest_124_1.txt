Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem:**

* **Event A:** Attacker is Black
* **Event B:** Witness identifies the attacker as Black

Let's break down the components:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (given in the problem)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as Black given that the attacker is Black = 0.80 (witness's accuracy)
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as Black given that the attacker is not Black = 0.20 (witness's error rate)
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85 (given in the problem)

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios:

*  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
*  P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's testimony and the information about the city's population, the estimated probability that the attacker is Black is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
