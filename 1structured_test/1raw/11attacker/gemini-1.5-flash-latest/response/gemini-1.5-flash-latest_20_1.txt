Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **B:**  The attacker is black.
*  **W:** The attacker is white.
*  **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(B) = 0.15 (from information "a")
*  P(W) = 0.85 (from information "a")

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from information "b"):**

*  P(I | B) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies a black person)
*  P(I | W) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about an event (in this case, the attacker being black) based on new evidence (the witness's identification):

P(B | I) = [P(I | B) * P(B)] / P(I)

To find P(I), we use the law of total probability:

P(I) = P(I | B) * P(B) + P(I | W) * P(W) 
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.29

**5. Calculate the Probability:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B | I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
          = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Interpretation:**  The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%. This is higher than the initial probability of 15% but still significantly less than 50%. It's important to remember that this is just an estimate based on the provided information.
