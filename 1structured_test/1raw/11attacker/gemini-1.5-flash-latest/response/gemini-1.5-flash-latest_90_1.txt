Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. We have prior information about the racial distribution in the city (85% white, 15% black), and we have new evidence from a witness. We need to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Case**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Here's what we know:

* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
* P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

To calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.43 or 43%.**
