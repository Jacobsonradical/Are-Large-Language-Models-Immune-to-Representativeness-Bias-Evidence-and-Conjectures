This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to a real-world situation. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Terms:**

* **Prior Probability (P(B)):**  The probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony. This is based on the city's demographics: P(B) = 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(W|B)):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are actually black. This is the witness's accuracy: P(W|B) = 0.8.
* **Likelihood (P(W|W)):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are actually white. This is the witness's error rate: P(W|W) = 0.2.
* **Posterior Probability (P(B|W)):** The probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W)]

**We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as black:**

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|W) * P(W) 
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.26

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.26)
      = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4615.**
