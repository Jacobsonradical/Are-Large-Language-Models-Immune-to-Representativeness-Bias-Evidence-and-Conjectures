Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black. This is a conditional probability problem. We have information about:

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of a person being black in the city (15%).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80%).
* **False Positive Rate:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are actually white (20%).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black).
* **P(A) = 0.15** (The prior probability of a person being black in the city).
* **P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)** 

    *  P(B|not A) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black).
    *  P(not A) = 0.85 (The prior probability of a person being white in the city).
    *  P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's accuracy is independent of the actual race of the attacker. In reality, factors like lighting, stress, and other biases could influence the witness's perception. This is a simplified example to illustrate the use of Bayes' Theorem.
