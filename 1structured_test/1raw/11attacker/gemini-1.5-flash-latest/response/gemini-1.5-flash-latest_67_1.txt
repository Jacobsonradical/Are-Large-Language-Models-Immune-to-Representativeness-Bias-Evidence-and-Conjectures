This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of someone being black in the city is 15% (given in "b"). This is our prior belief.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies race 80% of the time. This is the likelihood of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is actually black.
* **False Positive Rate:** The witness incorrectly identifies race 20% of the time. This is the likelihood of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is actually white. 

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief (the probability of the attacker being black) based on the new evidence (the witness's statement). The formula is:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's statement (B). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is black, given that the attacker is actually black (80%).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B): The probability of the witness saying the attacker is black, regardless of their actual race. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is black and the attacker is white.

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is Black:** The probability of the witness saying "black" is 80% (the likelihood).
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is White:** The probability of the witness saying "black" is 20% (the false positive rate).

We can calculate P(B) by weighting these probabilities by the prior probabilities of each scenario:

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
```

**Putting it all Together**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                          = 0.414 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness claims the attacker was black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only about 41.4%. This demonstrates that eyewitness testimony can be unreliable, and we need to consider the statistical context when evaluating such information.
