This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can approach the problem:

**Let's Define Events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We know the following:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white.
* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy).
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white (20% error).

**We want to find P(B|I):** The probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**Calculation:**

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(B|I) = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
