This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our belief about an event based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (from the given information).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (since they are correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (from the population demographics).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (from the population demographics).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
