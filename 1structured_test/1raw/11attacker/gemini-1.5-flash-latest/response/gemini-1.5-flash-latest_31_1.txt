This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and evidence can be combined using Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **B:**  The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **BW:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.
* **WW:** The witness identifies the attacker as white.

**2. Prior Probabilities (From information "a"):**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Probability of the attacker being black)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Probability of the attacker being white)

**3. Conditional Probabilities (From information "b"):**

* **P(BW|B) = 0.8** (Probability of witness identifying as black given the attacker is black)
* **P(BW|W) = 0.2** (Probability of witness identifying as black given the attacker is white)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(B|BW)**, the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black. Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(B|BW) = [P(BW|B) * P(B)] / P(BW) 
```

Where **P(BW)** is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(BW) = P(BW|B) * P(B) + P(BW|W) * P(W)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(BW) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**
* **P(B|BW) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  â‰ˆ 0.46**

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.46} 

**Interpretation:**  The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 46%. While the witness's identification provides some evidence, it's important to note that the initial probability of a black attacker being involved is relatively low, and the witness isn't always accurate.
