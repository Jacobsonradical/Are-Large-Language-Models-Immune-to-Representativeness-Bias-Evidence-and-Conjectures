This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our belief based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:

**Understanding the Terms**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being black before we consider the witness's testimony. This is simply the proportion of black people in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given they are actually black (80% accurate).
* **Likelihood of the opposite:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given they are actually white (20% error rate).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our case**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is black
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Here's how to plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (likelihood of correctly identifying a black person as black)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29  (This is calculated by considering both scenarios: the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person).

Now we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
