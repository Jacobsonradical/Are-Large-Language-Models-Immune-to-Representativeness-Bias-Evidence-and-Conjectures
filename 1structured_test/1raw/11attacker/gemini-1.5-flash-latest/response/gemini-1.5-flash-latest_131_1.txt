Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's race (based on the city's demographics) with the new information from the witness.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying to Our Case**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's break down each part of Bayes' Theorem:

1. **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from city demographics) = 0.15
2. **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (witness accuracy) = 0.80
3. **P(B| not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (witness error) = 0.20
4. **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is approximately 41.4%. This is significantly higher than the initial 15% based on demographics alone, but it's still less than a 50% chance. The witness's accuracy, though good, is not perfect, and we must consider the possibility of a false identification.
