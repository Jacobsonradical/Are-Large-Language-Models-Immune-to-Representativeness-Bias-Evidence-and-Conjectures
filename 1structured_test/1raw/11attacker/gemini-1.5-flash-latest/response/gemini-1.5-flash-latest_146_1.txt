This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to apply it to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior probability:** The probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony is 15% (based on the city's population demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they actually are black (80% accurate).
* **Likelihood of error:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are not black (20% error rate).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying it to our case**

Let's define:

* **A:** Attacker is black.
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B): the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are black)
* **P(B|not A):** 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given they are not black)

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is black, witness identifies correctly: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is white, witness identifies incorrectly: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138}
