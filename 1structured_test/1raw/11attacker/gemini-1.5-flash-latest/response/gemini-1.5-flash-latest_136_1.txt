Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're trying to determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.  This is a classic example of how prior beliefs (the city's demographics) and new evidence (the witness's identification) can be combined to update our understanding of the situation.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define the following events:

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Where:

* **P(B|W):** The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black (what we want to find).
* **P(W|B):** The probability the witness would identify someone as black given they are actually black (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B):** The prior probability of the attacker being black (the city's demographics).
* **P(W):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black (this requires a bit more work).

**Calculations**

1. **P(B):**  From the information given, P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is black).

2. **P(W|B):** The witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time, so P(W|B) = 0.80.

3. **P(W):** We need to consider both cases: the attacker is black and the attacker is white.
    * **P(W|B) * P(B):** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black and the person actually being black. 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * **P(W|¬B) * P(¬B):** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black and the person actually being white (¬B means "not black").  The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is white, so this is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.
    * **P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

4. **P(B|W):** Putting it all together:
    * P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
    * P(B|W) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414. This means that the witness's testimony, while not definitive, does increase the probability of the attacker being black, but it's still far from certain.
