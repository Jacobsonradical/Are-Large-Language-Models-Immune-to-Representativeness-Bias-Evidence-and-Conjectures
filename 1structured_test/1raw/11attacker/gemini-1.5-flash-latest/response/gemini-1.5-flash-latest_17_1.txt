This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's identification.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from the population data) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black = 0.20 
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.29

**Now, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.**

**{probability: 0.41}**
