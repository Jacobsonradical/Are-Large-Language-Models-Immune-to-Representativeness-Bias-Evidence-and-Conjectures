Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race given the witness's testimony.  Here's how the pieces fit together:

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being black is 15% (given in the information).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are actually black, is 80%.
* **Likelihood (Alternate):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given they are actually white, is 20% (since they are correct 80% of the time).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

* **B:** Event that the attacker is black
* **W:** Event that the attacker is white
* **T:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(B|T), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(B|T) = [P(T|B) * P(B)] / P(T) 
```

Where:

* **P(T|B):** Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black (80%)
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (15%)
* **P(T):** Total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This needs to be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(T) = P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)
    * P(T) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

```
P(B|T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(B|T) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
