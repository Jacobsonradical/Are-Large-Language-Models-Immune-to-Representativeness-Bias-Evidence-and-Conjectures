This is a classic example of how to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(B) = 0.15:** The probability of the attacker being black based on the city's demographics.
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The probability of the attacker being white based on the city's demographics.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(I|B) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black.
* **P(I|W) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white.

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

Where P(I) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

**5. Calculation**

* **P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
