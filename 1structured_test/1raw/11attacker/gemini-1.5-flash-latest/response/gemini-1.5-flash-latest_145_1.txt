Here's how we can calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black, given they are actually black.
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black, given they are actually white.
* **P(B) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white.

**We want to find P(B|I), the probability the attacker is black, given the witness identified them as black.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

To find P(I), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as black, we use the law of total probability:

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W) 
P(I) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B|I):

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
