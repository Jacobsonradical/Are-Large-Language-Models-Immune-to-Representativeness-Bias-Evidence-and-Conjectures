Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're dealing with a classic Bayesian inference problem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being black (our hypothesis) given the evidence from the witness and the population statistics.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**Let's break down the given information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given that they are black (80% accuracy).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15% of the population).
* **P(B|not A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given that they are not black (20% error rate).
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (85% of the population).

**We need to calculate P(B):**

This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**Now, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.46 or 46%.**
