This problem is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break it down:

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population distribution).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (the witness's identification) given a specific event (the attacker's actual race).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate - the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is black
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Posterior probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification
* P(B|A) = Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black (80% accuracy)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being black (15%)
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (this requires a bit more calculation)

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A) = Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are not black (20% error rate, meaning 20% chance of being wrongly identified as black)
* P(not A) = Prior probability of the attacker not being black (85%)

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Now we have all the pieces to calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%.  This is higher than the initial prior probability of 15% but still significantly less than a 50% chance. It's important to remember that the witness is not always accurate, and the relatively high percentage of white people in the city influences the overall probability.
