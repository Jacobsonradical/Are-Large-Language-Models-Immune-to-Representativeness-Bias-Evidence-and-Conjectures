This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misleading when dealing with probabilities, and how a careful application of Bayes' Theorem can provide a more accurate answer. 

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker *not* being black = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is not black = 0.20 (witness error rate)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's identification):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Important Note:**  Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only about 41%. This is because the witness is not a perfect identifier, and the prior probability of someone being black in the city is low.
