This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of a person in the city being black (from information "b").
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person in the city being white.
* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (from information "a").
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are actually white (from information "a").

**We want to find P(B|I): the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker is black or white):**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)
P(I) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.46}
