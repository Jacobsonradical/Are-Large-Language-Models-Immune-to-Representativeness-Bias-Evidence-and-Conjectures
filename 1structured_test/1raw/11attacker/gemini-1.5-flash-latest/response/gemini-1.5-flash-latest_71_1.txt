This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of an event before considering any new evidence. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence given a specific event. In this case, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is actually black is 80%.
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Let's define:

*  A: Event that the attacker is black
*  B: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A) = 0.80**  (The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (The prior probability of the attacker being black)
* **P(B)**  (This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. We need to calculate this.)

**Calculating P(B):**

We can use the law of total probability to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|A) = 0.80
* P(A) = 0.15
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (The prior probability of the attacker not being black)

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, calculating the posterior probability:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

While the witness's identification provides some evidence, the updated probability of the attacker being black is still less than 50%. This highlights the importance of considering both the reliability of the evidence and the prior probabilities in making inferences.
