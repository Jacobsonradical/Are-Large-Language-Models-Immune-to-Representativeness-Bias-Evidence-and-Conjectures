This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** Prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B):** The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is black (A), witness identifies them correctly (B|A)
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is white (¬A), witness misidentifies them as black (B|¬A)

**Therefore:**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
