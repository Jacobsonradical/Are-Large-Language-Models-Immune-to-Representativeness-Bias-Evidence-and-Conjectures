This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by statistics, and how we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to get the correct answer. Here's how we break it down:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The city's population demographics give us the prior probability of a random person being black (15%).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race provides the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as black, given they actually are black (80%) and given they are not black (20%).
* **Posterior Probability:** We want to find the probability the attacker is black *given* the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given event B has already happened (our posterior probability).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given event A has already happened (our likelihood).
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Applying the Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to calculate:

* P(A|B): The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.
* P(B|A): The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they actually are black (80%).
* P(A): The probability of a random person in the city being black (15%).
* P(B): The probability of the witness identifying someone as black (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person and the probability of incorrectly identifying a white person as black:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|Not A) * P(Not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's accuracy is consistent across different races. In reality, there could be biases in perception and identification that would need to be considered for a more nuanced analysis.
