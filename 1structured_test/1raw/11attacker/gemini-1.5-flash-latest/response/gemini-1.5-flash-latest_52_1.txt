Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an attacker being black, based on the city's demographics)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To calculate P(B), we need the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
