This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to real-world situations. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is based on the city's population demographics (15%).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's ability to identify race correctly (80%) and incorrectly (20%).
* **Posterior Probability:**  The probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (the posterior probability).
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened (the likelihood).
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): The prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying to the Problem**

* **A:** Attacker is black.
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as black.

1. **P(A):** 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being black, based on city demographics)
2. **P(B|A):** 0.80 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
3. **P(B|not A):** 0.20 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)
4. **P(not A):** 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being white)

**Calculating P(B):**

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as black in two scenarios:

* Witness correctly identifies a black person: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* Witness incorrectly identifies a white person: P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore:  P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
