This problem involves using Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race given the witness's testimony. Here's how to break it down:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being black (based on population demographics) = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black = 0.80 
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B): the probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
