This is a classic example of how to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being black is the proportion of black people in the city.
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white is the proportion of white people in the city.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(I|B) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black (true positive).
* **P(I|W) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are white (false positive).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

Where P(I) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

**5. Calculation**

* P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness is generally reliable in identifying race, the fact that the majority of the population is white significantly impacts the probability that the attacker is black. Based on the witness's testimony and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.38%.
