This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** The probability that the attacker is black (from the population demographics) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is not black (white) = 0.85

**3.  Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy)**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are black (true positive) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are not black (false positive) = 0.20

**4.  Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the attacker's race (A) given the witness's statement (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5.  Calculate P(B)**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race. This is done using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.29

**6.  Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug all the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
        = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is still only about 41.4%. This is because the prior probability of a black attacker in this city is relatively low (15%), and the witness has a significant chance of making a false identification.
