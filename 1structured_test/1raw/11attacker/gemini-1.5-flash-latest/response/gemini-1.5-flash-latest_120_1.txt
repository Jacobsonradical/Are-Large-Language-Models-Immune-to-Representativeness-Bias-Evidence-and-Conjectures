This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and witness testimony can be combined to calculate a more accurate posterior probability. Here's how we can approach this:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is black.
*  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability the attacker is black, which is the proportion of black people in the city = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability the attacker is not black (i.e., white) = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities from Witness Testimony:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they actually are black (true positive) = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are not black (false positive) = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B) (the probability the witness identifies someone as black), we need to consider both scenarios:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%. This is higher than the prior probability of 15% but still suggests that the attacker is more likely to be white.
