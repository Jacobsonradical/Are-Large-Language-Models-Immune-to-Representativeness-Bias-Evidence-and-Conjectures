This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about an event based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black, which is 80%.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black, which is 20%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of the attacker being white, which is 85%.

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**To find P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**Let's plug in the numbers:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
