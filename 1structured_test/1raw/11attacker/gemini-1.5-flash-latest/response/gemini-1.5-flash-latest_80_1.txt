This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by base rates. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding Base Rates**

* **Base Rate:** The proportion of black people in the city (15%). This is the prior probability of the attacker being black.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has an 80% accuracy rate, but also a 20% error rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is black.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The base rate of black people in the city (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is right and wrong:

* **Scenario 1: Witness is right (identifies black person as black)**
    * P(Witness is right AND attacker is black) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Witness is wrong (identifies white person as black)**
    * P(Witness is wrong AND attacker is white) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 

**P(B) = Scenario 1 + Scenario 2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

While the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is only about 41.4%. This is significantly lower than the witness's accuracy rate because of the low base rate of black people in the city.
