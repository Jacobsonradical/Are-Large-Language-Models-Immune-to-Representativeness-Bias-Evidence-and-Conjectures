Here's how to approach this problem, which involves applying Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the racial makeup of the city (85% white, 15% black). We also have information about the witness's reliability in identifying race.  Our goal is to update the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (this is what we want to find)
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening
* P(B): The prior probability of event B happening

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Case**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the city's population).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B| not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are not black (i.e., white) is 0.2 (20% error rate).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black is 0.85 (85% of the city's population).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black.  We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy is independent of the actual race of the attacker. In reality, there could be biases or other factors that influence witness identification.
