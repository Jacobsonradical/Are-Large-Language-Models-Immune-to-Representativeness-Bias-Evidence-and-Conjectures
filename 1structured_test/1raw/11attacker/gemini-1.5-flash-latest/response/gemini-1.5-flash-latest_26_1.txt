Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the population demographics (85% white, 15% black).  We also have information about the witness's reliability in identifying race. We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Case**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

Let's break down the components:

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from the population demographics).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black is 80% (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|Not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white) is 20% (the witness's error rate).
* **P(Not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black is 85%.

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we need to consider both scenarios (attacker being black and attacker being white):

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Not A) * P(Not A)
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black:

* P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's reliability is independent of the attacker's actual race. In reality, factors like racial bias could influence the witness's accuracy.
