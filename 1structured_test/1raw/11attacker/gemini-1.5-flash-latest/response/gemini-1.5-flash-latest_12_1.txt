This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the calculation:

**Let's define the events:**

* **B:**  The attacker is black.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We want to find P(B|W), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(W|B) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black (80% accuracy).
* **P(W|~B) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black (20% error rate).
* **P(B) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15% of the population).
* **P(~B) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white (85% of the population).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

**To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:**

P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(B|W):**

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(B|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
