This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and observational evidence can be combined using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** Probability of the attacker being black (from information 'a') = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Probability of the attacker not being black = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black (from information 'b') = 0.8
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
* P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(A|B) ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Explanation:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only around 41.4%. This is because the witness is not perfectly accurate, and the prior probability of someone being black in the city is relatively low.
