This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (from the city's demographics).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white.
* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black (80% accuracy).
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20% error).

**We want to find P(B|I):** The probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

**Let's calculate:**

* P(I) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.4615.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4615}
