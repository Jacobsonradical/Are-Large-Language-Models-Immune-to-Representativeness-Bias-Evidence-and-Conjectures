This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability the attacker is black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is not black = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are black = 0.8 (80% accuracy)
* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are not black = 0.2 (20% error)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
