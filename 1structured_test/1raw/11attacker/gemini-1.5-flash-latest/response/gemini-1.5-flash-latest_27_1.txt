This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is black (80% accuracy) = 0.8.
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (20% error) = 0.2.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15% of the population) = 0.15.
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (85% of the population) = 0.85.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
