This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **B:** The attacker is black.
*  **W:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2.  Known Probabilities:**

* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (from population data) = 0.15
* **P(¬B):** Prior probability of the attacker NOT being black = 0.85
* **P(W|B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black (from witness accuracy) = 0.80
* **P(W|¬B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are NOT black = 0.20 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)] 
```

**4. Calculate:**

```
P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(B|W) = 0.40
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.40} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.40 (or 40%).**
