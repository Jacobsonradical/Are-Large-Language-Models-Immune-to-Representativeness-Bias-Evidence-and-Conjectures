Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Prior probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race (80% correct, 20% error).
* **Posterior probability:**  The probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's statement.

**Calculations**

1. **Let's define events:**
   *  A: The attacker is black.
   *  B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   * P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being black)
   * P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker not being black)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   * P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
   * P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   * P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

5. **Substitute and Calculate:**
   * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
   * P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
   * P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 41.4%. While the witness's statement provides some evidence, it's important to remember that their accuracy is not perfect, and the initial population distribution still plays a role in the calculation.
