Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony.  Here's how we break it down:

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population distribution).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): Probability of event B happening.

**Let's translate this to our problem:**

* A: Attacker is black
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as black

Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = [P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black)] / P(Witness says black)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) = 0.80** (witness's accuracy)
* **P(Attacker is black) = 0.15** (prior probability)
* **P(Witness says black):** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:

    * P(Witness says black) = P(Witness says black | Attacker is black) * P(Attacker is black) + P(Witness says black | Attacker is white) * P(Attacker is white)
    * P(Witness says black) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating the Final Probability**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(Attacker is black | Witness says black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is 0.48 or 48%.
