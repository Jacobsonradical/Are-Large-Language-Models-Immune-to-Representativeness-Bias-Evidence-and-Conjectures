Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayes' Theorem. We want to update our belief about the attacker's race (black) given the witness testimony. 

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A (attacker is black) given event B (witness says black).  This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness saying "black" given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness saying "black", which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

**Calculation**

1. **P(B)**: The probability of the witness saying "black" can occur in two ways:
    * Witness is correct and attacker is black: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness is wrong and attacker is white: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

2. **P(A|B)**: Plugging into Bayes' Theorem:

    P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation is based on the information provided.  It's crucial to remember that:

* **Witness reliability:** The witness's accuracy is a key assumption. Real-world witness testimony can be much more complex.
* **Population demographics:**  The city's population makeup could be different in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
* **Other factors:** Other evidence could significantly change the probability.
