This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by base rates and how to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the correct probability. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Base Rate:** 15% of the population is black. This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness identified the attacker as black, but they have a 20% error rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's testimony):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's testimony (B) 
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy, or 0.8)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being black (15% or 0.15)
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black (this is a bit trickier, we'll calculate it below)

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as black in two scenarios:

1. **They are actually black:** 0.15 (probability of being black) * 0.8 (accuracy) = 0.12
2. **They are actually white:** 0.85 (probability of being white) * 0.2 (error rate) = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all Together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is still less than 50%. This highlights how our intuition can be swayed by strong, but imperfect, evidence, and the importance of using Bayesian reasoning to account for prior probabilities and the reliability of information.
