Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black, given that a witness identified them as black. This is a conditional probability problem.

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new information is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing new evidence given a specific event. Here, the likelihood is the probability that the witness would identify someone as black, given that they actually are black (80% accuracy).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering new information. This is what we are trying to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A.
* P(B): The probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being black)
* P(B|A) = 0.8 (likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are black)
* P(B) =  This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given they are not black)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker not being black)

Therefore:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46}

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 46%. While the witness's testimony increases the likelihood from the initial 15%, it's important to note that there's still a significant chance the attacker was not black.
