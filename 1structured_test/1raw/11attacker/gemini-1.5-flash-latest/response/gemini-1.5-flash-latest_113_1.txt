Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the racial makeup of the city (85% white, 15% black). This is our "prior probability." We also have information about the witness's accuracy in identifying race.  This is our "likelihood."  We want to find the "posterior probability" – the probability the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A.
* P(B): Prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem:**

* Let A = "Attacker is black"
* Let B = "Witness identifies the attacker as black"

We need to find P(A|B) – the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are black. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is black, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
