Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

* **Let B be the event that the attacker is black.**
* **Let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.**

We want to find P(B|W), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the population proportion of black people, 15% (0.15).
* **P(W):** Overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|not B) * P(not B)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
