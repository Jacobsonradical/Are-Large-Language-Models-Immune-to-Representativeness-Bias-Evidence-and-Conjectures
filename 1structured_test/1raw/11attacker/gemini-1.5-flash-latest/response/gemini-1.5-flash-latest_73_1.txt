This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is black.
*  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are black = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that they are not black = 0.20 

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability of the attacker being black given that the witness identified them as black.

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 

P(A|B) ≈ 0.41 
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41} 

**Explanation:**  Even though the witness is relatively accurate, the fact that the majority of the population is white significantly influences the final probability. The updated probability of the attacker being black is around 41%, meaning the evidence from the witness slightly increases the chance of the attacker being black, but it's still less than a 50% probability.
