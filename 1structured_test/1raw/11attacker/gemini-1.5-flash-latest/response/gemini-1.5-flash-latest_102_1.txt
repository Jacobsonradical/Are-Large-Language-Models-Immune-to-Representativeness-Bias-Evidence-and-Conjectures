This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **A:** Event that the attacker is black.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.
* **P(A):** Prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the city's population: 0.15)
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the witness identifying someone as black (not directly given, but we'll calculate it later).
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy, so 0.8).
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (20% error rate, so 0.2).
* **P(A|B):**  The probability we want to find - the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which involves considering both cases (attacker actually being black and not being black):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
