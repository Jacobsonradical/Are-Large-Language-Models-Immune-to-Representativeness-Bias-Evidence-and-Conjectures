Here's how to calculate the probability, applying Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from witness accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given they are actually black = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given they are actually not black = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Explanation:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only about 41.4%. This is because the witness has a significant chance of misidentifying someone's race, and the population of the city is predominantly white.
