This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and evidence can be combined using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Terms**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (witness's identification) given a specific event (the attacker's actual race).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate: the probability the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A (attacker is black) given evidence B (witness identified as black).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of the attacker's actual race. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is black (probability = 15%). Witness correctly identifies as black (probability = 80%).  This gives a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is white (probability = 85%). Witness incorrectly identifies as black (probability = 20%). This gives a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Adding these probabilities together gives us P(B): 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is black | Witness identified as black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation highlights how even with relatively strong evidence, the prior probability can significantly influence the posterior probability. While the witness is accurate 80% of the time, the fact that only 15% of the city's population is black means that the probability the attacker is black is still less than 50%.
