Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of a "false positive" problem. The witness has a high accuracy rate but still makes mistakes.  We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of black people in the city to determine the actual probability of the attacker being black.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of A given B (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of B given A (witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are black)
* P(A) = Prior probability of A (base rate of black people in the city)
* P(B) = Probability of B (witness identifying someone as black)

**Applying to Our Problem**

* **A:** Attacker is black
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A):** 0.15 (base rate of black people in the city)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (witness correctly identifies someone as black, given they are black)
* **P(B|not A):** 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as black, given they are white)
* **P(not A):** 0.85 (base rate of white people in the city)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness identifies someone as black:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
* P(B) = 0.29

**Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
