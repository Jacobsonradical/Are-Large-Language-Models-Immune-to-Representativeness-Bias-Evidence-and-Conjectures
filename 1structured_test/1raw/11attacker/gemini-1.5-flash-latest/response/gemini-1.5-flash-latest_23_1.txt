This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** Probability of the attacker being black (based on population demographics) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**3.  Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black = 0.80 (80% accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black = 0.20 (20% error)

**4.  Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.41.**
