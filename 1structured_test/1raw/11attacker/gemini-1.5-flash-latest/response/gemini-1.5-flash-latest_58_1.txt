This is a classic example of how our intuition about probabilities can be misleading. We need to apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the actual probability.

Here's how to break it down:

* **Prior probability:** The probability of the attacker being black before considering the witness's testimony is 15% (based on the city's population demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black is 80%.
* **Likelihood (error):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually white is 20%.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness's testimony (B).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood (80%).
* P(A) is the prior probability (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated as: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(attacker is black | witness says black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                         = 0.414 
```

Therefore:

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** While the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability that the attacker is actually black is only 41.4%. This illustrates how eyewitness testimony, even when seemingly reliable, can be significantly influenced by prior probabilities and the potential for error.
