Here's how to calculate the probability, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "B" be the event that the attacker is black.
*  Let "W" be the event that the attacker is white.
*  Let "IDB" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

*  P(B) = 0.15 (From information "a")
*  P(W) = 0.85 (From information "a")

**3. Likelihoods**

*  P(IDB | B) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a black person as black 80% of the time)
*  P(IDB | W) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

P(B | IDB) = [P(IDB | B) * P(B)] / [P(IDB | B) * P(B) + P(IDB | W) * P(W)]

**5. Calculation**

P(B | IDB) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
           = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
           = 0.12 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
