Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a prior probability (based on population demographics) and evidence from a witness. We want to find the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Posterior probability of event A happening given event B has occurred (probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony).
* P(B|A) = Likelihood of observing event B if event A is true (probability of the witness identifying someone as black if they are actually black).
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (probability of a person in the city being black).
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B (probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race).

**Applying the Information:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black) 

**Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* Witness identifies a black person correctly:  0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* Witness identifies a white person incorrectly: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
