This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to a real-world scenario. Here's how we can break down the problem:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We need to find:** P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.

**What we know:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's demographics) is 0.15.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black is 0.80.
* **P(B| not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black is 0.20 (since they are correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (white) is 0.85.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* **Scenario 1: Witness is correct:** P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Witness is incorrect:** P(B| not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
