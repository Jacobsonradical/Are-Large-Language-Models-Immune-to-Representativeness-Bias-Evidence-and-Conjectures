This problem requires using Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony. 

Here's how to approach it:

**1. Define Events:**

* **B:**  The attacker is black.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being black, based on the city's population.
* **P(¬B) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black.

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(W|B) = 0.8:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black.
* **P(W|¬B) = 0.2:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are not black.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(B|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|W) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(B|W) = 0.4
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4} 

**Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.4 or 40%.**
