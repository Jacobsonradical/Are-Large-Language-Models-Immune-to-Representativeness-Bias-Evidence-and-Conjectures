Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **E:**  The event that the attacker is black.
* **W:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.**

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(E|W) = [P(W|E) * P(E)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|E):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is actually black.  This is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying black individuals, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(E):** The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is the proportion of black people in the city, 15% (0.15).
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black (regardless of the attacker's actual race). This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(W)**

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)

* **P(W|not E):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given that the attacker is not black (i.e., white). This is the witness's error rate for identifying white individuals as black, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not E):** The probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., white), which is 85% (0.85).

Therefore:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it All Together**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(E|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
