This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and witness testimony can be combined using Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability of an event. Here's how to calculate the probability that the attacker is black:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is black.
*  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability that the attacker is black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is not black (white) = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities (Based on Witness Accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black = 0.80 (80% accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white = 0.20 (20% error rate)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(A|B) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.**
