Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with a classic example of how prior probabilities (the population makeup) and conditional probabilities (the witness's accuracy) influence our belief about an event (the attacker's race). 

**Let's Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**Given Information:**

* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (15% of the population)
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker *not* being black = 0.85 (85% of the population)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black = 0.8 (80% accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is *not* black = 0.2 (20% error rate)

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the population demographics, the estimated probability of the attacker being black is approximately 0.4615, or about 46.15%.
