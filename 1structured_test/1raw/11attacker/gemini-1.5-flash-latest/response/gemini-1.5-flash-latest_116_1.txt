Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being black, given the information provided:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being black *given* the witness's testimony.  This is different from the probability of a random person in the city being black, which is simply 15%.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case, this is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given that they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening. This is the probability of a random person in the city being black (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.  We need to calculate this, but it's the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race.

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Given in the problem, the witness correctly identifies a black person 80% of the time)

2. **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of a person in the city being black)

3. **P(B):**  We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This can happen in two ways:

   * The person is actually black (15% chance), and the witness identifies them correctly (80% chance).  
   * The person is actually white (85% chance), and the witness mistakenly identifies them as black (20% chance).

   So, P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

4. **P(A|B):**  Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%. This is significantly higher than the baseline probability of 15% but still indicates that there's a substantial chance the attacker could be white. It's crucial to remember that this is a probabilistic estimate and not a definitive conclusion.
