This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:**  The probability of someone being black in the city is 15% (from "a").
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy in identifying race is 80% correct, and 20% incorrect.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as black.
* **Goal:** We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually black, given the witness's statement.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is black
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is black, given that the witness identified them as black (this is what we want to find).
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black, given they *are* black. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone in the city is black, which is 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability that the witness identifies someone as black (regardless of their actual race). This is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This calculation highlights the potential for bias in eyewitness testimony, even when the witness is generally accurate.  The witness's statement does increase the probability that the attacker is black, but it's not definitive.
