This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by statistics, a concept known as Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The city's population tells us the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (0.15). This is the chance before we consider any witness testimony.
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy provides the likelihood of them correctly identifying a black person (80%) and incorrectly identifying a white person as black (20%).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A happened (likelihood).
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening (can be calculated using the law of total probability).

**Applying to our case:**

*  A: Attacker is black
*  B: Witness identified the attacker as black

1. **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black attacker = 0.80 (likelihood of correctly identifying a black person)
2. **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15
3. **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
4. **P(A|B):**  Probability of the attacker being black given the witness identified them as black. 
    * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Important Note:** Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only around 41%. This highlights how unreliable eyewitness testimony can be, especially when considering racial identification.
