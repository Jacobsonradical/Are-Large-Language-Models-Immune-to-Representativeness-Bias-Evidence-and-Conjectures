This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being black before any witness testimony is 15% (from "a"). This is our prior belief.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black is 80% (from "b"). This is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
* **False Positive Rate:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black when they are actually white is 20% (from "b"). This is the likelihood of the evidence given the alternative hypothesis.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A (attacker is black) given event B (witness identified as black). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black (80%).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which we need to calculate.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
   * P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are white (20%).
   * P(¬A) is the probability of the attacker not being black (85%).

Therefore, P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Black | Witness identified as Black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness is generally reliable, the fact that the prior probability of the attacker being black is only 15% significantly influences the final estimate. The probability that the attacker is black increases to approximately 41% after considering the witness testimony.
