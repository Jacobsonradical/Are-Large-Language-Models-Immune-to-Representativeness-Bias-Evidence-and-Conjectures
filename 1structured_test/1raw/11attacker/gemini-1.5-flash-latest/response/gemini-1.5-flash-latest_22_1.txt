Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is black.
* **B:**  Event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of a black attacker based on city demographics)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.**

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 ≈ 0.46

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.46}
