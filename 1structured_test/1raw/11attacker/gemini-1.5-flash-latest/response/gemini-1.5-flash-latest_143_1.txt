Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Case**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

Let's break down the elements:

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (given in the information).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is black, is 80% (the witness's accuracy rate).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given the attacker is not black, is 20% (the witness's error rate).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black is 85% (100% - 15%).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41%. This is higher than the prior probability of 15% but still does not provide conclusive evidence. It's important to consider all available information and not rely solely on eyewitness testimony.
