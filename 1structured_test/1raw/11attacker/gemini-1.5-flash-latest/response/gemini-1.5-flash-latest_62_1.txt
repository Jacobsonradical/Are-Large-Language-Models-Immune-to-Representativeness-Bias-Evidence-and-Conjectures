Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We know the following:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being black (from the city's demographics).
* **P(W|B) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black, given they are actually black.
* **P(W|¬B) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black, given they are not black (i.e., white). 
* **P(¬B) = 0.85:** The probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., white).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|¬B) * P(¬B)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(B|W) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.41}
