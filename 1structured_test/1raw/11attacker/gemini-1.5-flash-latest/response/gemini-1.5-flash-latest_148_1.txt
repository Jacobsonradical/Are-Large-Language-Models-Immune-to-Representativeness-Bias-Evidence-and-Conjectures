Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's ability to correctly identify race (80% accuracy).
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's denote:

*  B: The event that the attacker is black.
*  W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(B|W): The probability of the attacker being black given the witness's identification.  This is what we want to find.
* P(W|B): The probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(B): The prior probability of the attacker being black (15%).
* P(W): The probability of the witness identifying someone as black (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(W)**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* P(W) = P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|~B) * P(~B) 
   * P(W|~B): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black given they are not black (20% error rate).
   * P(~B): The probability of the attacker not being black (85%).

Plugging in the values:

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(B|W)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%. While the witness's testimony increases the likelihood, it doesn't definitively prove the attacker's race due to the potential for error.
