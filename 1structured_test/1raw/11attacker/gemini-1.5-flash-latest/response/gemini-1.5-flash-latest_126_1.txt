Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's statement. This is a classic example of how prior information (the city's demographics) and evidence (the witness's statement) can be combined to update our belief.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is black.
* B: Witness identified the attacker as black.

Now, let's plug in the values:

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black is 80% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white is 20% (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., being white) is 85%.

We need to calculate **P(B)**, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's statement, is approximately 41.4%. This is higher than the prior probability of 15% but still significantly lower than 50%. This demonstrates how the witness's statement, despite being somewhat unreliable, provides valuable information that updates our estimate of the attacker's race.
