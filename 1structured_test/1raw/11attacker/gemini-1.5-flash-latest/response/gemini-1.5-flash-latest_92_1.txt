This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and witness testimony can be combined to update our beliefs. Here's how to approach the problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(A):**  Probability of the attacker being black (prior probability) = 0.15 
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as black given they are black = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as black given they are not black = 0.20

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

**4. Calculation:**

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Explanation:**

The probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%. While the witness's testimony suggests the attacker is black, the prior probability of someone being black in the city (15%) and the witness's error rate significantly reduce the overall likelihood.
