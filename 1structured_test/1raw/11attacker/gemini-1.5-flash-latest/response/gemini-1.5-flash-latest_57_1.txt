This is a classic example of how to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break it down:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before we consider any new evidence. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (the percentage of black people in the city).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (the witness's identification) given a particular event (the attacker's true race). 
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate â€“ the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement.

**Calculations:**

1. **Prior Probability (P(Black)):** 0.15

2. **Likelihood of Witness Identifying Black Given Black Attacker (P(Witness says Black | Black)):** 0.80 (80% accuracy)

3. **Likelihood of Witness Identifying Black Given White Attacker (P(Witness says Black | White)):** 0.20 (20% error rate)

4. **Prior Probability of White Attacker (P(White)):** 0.85

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Black | Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness says Black)

To get P(Witness says Black), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Black attacker, witness identifies correctly: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** White attacker, witness identifies incorrectly: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(Witness says Black) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Finally, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Black | Witness says Black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = **0.41** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
