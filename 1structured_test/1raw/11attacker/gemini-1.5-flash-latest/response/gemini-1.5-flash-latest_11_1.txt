Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's testimony.  

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B happening

**Applying to our problem:**

* **A:** Attacker is black
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as black

Let's break down the components:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (given in information 'a')
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black = 0.80 (given in information 'b')
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is not black (white) = 0.20 (given in information 'b')
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85 (given in information 'a')

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This can be done using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
