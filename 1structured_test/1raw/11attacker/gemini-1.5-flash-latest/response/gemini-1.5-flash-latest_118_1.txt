This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(B) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on population demographics).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white.
* **P(I|B) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as black when they are actually black.
* **P(I|W) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as black when they are actually white.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we need the law of total probability:**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)

**Let's calculate:**

* P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**In conclusion, the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.38%.**
