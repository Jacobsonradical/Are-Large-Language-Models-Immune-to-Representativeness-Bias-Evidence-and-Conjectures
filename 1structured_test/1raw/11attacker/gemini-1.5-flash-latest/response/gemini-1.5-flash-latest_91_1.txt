This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misleading when dealing with probabilities.  Here's how to approach the problem:

**Understanding Bayes' Theorem**

This problem requires Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.  The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to the Scenario**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as black.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (from information "a").
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are black is 80% (from information "b").
* **P(B):** This is a bit trickier.  We need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as black, regardless of their actual race.  We can use the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:**  Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only about 41.4%. This highlights how eyewitness testimony, even with an assessment of their accuracy, can be misleading.
