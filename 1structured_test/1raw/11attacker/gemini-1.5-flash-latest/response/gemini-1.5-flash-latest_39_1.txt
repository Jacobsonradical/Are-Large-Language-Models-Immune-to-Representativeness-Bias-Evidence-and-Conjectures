This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event given some evidence. Here's how we can solve it:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that a person in the city is black.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies a black person as black.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a white person as black.

**To apply Bayes' Theorem, we also need P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:**

* **P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A)** 
   *  P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability the attacker is not black)
   *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)**
* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29**
* **P(A|B) ≈ 0.414**

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
