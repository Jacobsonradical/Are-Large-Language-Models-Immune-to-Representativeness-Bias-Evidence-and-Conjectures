Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're trying to determine the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony and the city's population demographics. This is a classic example of Bayesian inference.

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (the proportion of black people in the city).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (the witness's statement) given a particular event (the attacker's race). 
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of the event after considering the evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**Setting up Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

*  `B` = Event that the attacker is black
*  `W` = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as black

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(B|W) = Probability the attacker is black given the witness's statement (our goal)
* P(W|B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are actually black (80% from the problem)
* P(B) = Prior probability of the attacker being black (15%)
* P(W) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black (we need to calculate this)

**Calculating P(W)**

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: The attacker is black:**  P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: The attacker is white:** P(W|B') * P(B') = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17  (where B' represents the attacker being white)

P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 

**Calculating P(B|W)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:**  While this calculation provides an estimate, it's crucial to remember that:

* **Witness reliability:** The witness's accuracy is based on a limited sample and may not be perfectly representative of all situations.
* **Other factors:**  There may be other factors at play that are not considered here (e.g., the witness's potential bias). 
* **Legal implications:**  This calculation is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used in any legal proceedings without expert statistical analysis.
