This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as black given they are black (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black given they are not black (20% error rate).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15% of the population).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (85% of the population).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is 0.4.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
