This is a classic example of how prior probabilities and observational evidence can be combined using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Understanding the Terms:**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (witness testimony) given a specific event (the attacker being black or white).
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of the event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Let's define:

*  A: The event that the attacker is black.
*  B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as black.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black (our desired probability).
* P(B|A): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are actually black (80%, from the given information).
* P(A): The prior probability the attacker is black (15%).
* P(B): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are not black (20%, from the given information).
* P(not A): The probability the attacker is not black (85%).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating the Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 46.15%. This is higher than the initial 15% prior probability, but still significantly less than 100%. It highlights how even with potentially unreliable eyewitness testimony, the prior probability still plays a crucial role in evaluating the likelihood of an event.
