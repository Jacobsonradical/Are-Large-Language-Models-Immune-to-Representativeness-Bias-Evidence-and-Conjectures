Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the population demographics and the witness's ability to identify race. We need to use this information to update our belief about the attacker's race given the witness's testimony.

**Setting Up the Notation**

* Let 'B' represent the event that the attacker is black.
* Let 'W' represent the event that the attacker is white.
* Let 'S' represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about an event (B) given new evidence (S):

P(B|S) = [P(S|B) * P(B)] / P(S)

Where:

* P(B|S) is the probability of the attacker being black given the witness's statement. This is what we want to find.
* P(S|B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black (80% accuracy).
* P(B) is the prior probability of the attacker being black (15% from the population demographics).
* P(S) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(S)**

To find P(S), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is Black:**  P(S|B) * P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is White:** P(S|W) * P(W) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 

P(S) = P(S|B) * P(B) + P(S|W) * P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can calculate P(B|S):

P(B|S) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
