This is a classic example of how prior probabilities (base rates) and eyewitness testimony can be combined using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **B:**  The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(B) = 0.15:**  The probability of a randomly selected person in the city being black.
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The probability of a randomly selected person in the city being white.

**3.  Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* **P(I|B) = 0.8:**  The probability of the witness identifying a black person correctly as black.
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:**  The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black.

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(B|I), the probability that the attacker is black given that the witness identified them as black.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**5. Calculation**

* P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
* P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(B|I) = 0.12 / 0.29 
* P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:** Despite the eyewitness testimony, the probability that the attacker is black is still only around 41.4%. This demonstrates the importance of considering base rates (population demographics) alongside eyewitness testimony, as eyewitness accounts can be unreliable.
