Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We want to find P(B|I), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(I|B) = 0.8:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are black.
* **P(I|W) = 0.2:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are white.
* **P(B) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's population).
* **P(W) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker being white.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / [P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(B|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(B|I) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|I) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
