Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We need to update our prior belief (the population demographics) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case, this is the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. This is the probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black (80% accurate).
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening. This is the proportion of black people in the city (15%).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening. This is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black, which needs to be calculated.

**Calculations**

1. **P(B):** We need to consider both scenarios: the witness correctly identifying a black person and incorrectly identifying a white person as black.
    *  P(witness says black | person is black) = 0.8 (given)
    *  P(witness says black | person is white) = 0.2 (given)
    *  P(black person) = 0.15 (given)
    *  P(white person) = 0.85 (given)
    *  P(B) = [P(witness says black | person is black) * P(black person)] + [P(witness says black | person is white) * P(white person)] 
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **P(A|B):** Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:
    * P(attacker is black | witness says black) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26] 
    * P(attacker is black | witness says black) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Conclusion**

While the witness's testimony is helpful, it doesn't drastically change the probability from the prior belief. Even after the witness's statement, the probability of the attacker being black is still less than 50%.  It's important to remember that eyewitness testimony, especially in difficult conditions, can be unreliable.
