Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Terms**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the city's population demographics).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence (witness testimony) given a particular hypothesis. Here, we need to consider the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as black, given that the attacker is actually black (80% accurate) and the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as black, given that the attacker is actually white (20% inaccurate).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the hypothesis (attacker is black) given the new evidence (witness testimony). This is what we want to calculate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's denote:

* **B:** The event that the attacker is black.
* **W:** The event that the attacker is white.
* **T:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(B|T), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|T) = [P(T|B) * P(B)] / P(T)

To calculate P(T), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(T) = P(T|B) * P(B) + P(T|W) * P(W)

**Calculations**

* **P(T|B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is black = 0.8 (80% accuracy)
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being black = 0.15 (15% of the population)
* **P(T|W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is white = 0.2 (20% error)
* **P(W):** Prior probability of the attacker being white = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Now, let's plug these values into the equations:

1. **P(T) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29**
2. **P(B|T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.
