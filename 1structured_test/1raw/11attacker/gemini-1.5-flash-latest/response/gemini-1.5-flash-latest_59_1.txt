This problem involves applying Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's race based on the witness testimony. Here's how to break it down:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** Probability the attacker is black (based on city demographics) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Probability the attacker is not black = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are black = 0.8 (80% accurate identification)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as black given they are not black = 0.2 (20% error rate)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(A|B) is the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black, which is what we want to calculate.

**5. Calculate P(B)**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as black, using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**6. Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
