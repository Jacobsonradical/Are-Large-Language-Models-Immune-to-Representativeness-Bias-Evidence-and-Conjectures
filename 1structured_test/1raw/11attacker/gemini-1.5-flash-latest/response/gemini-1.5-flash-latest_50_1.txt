This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem being used to update our belief based on new evidence. Here's how we can break down the problem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **I:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**We know:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being black, based on population demographics)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being white)
* **P(I|B) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(I|W) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

**We want to find P(B|I) – the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|I) = [P(I|B) * P(B)] / P(I)

**To find P(I), we use the law of total probability:**

P(I) = P(I|B) * P(B) + P(I|W) * P(W) 
P(I) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(B|I):**

P(B|I) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
