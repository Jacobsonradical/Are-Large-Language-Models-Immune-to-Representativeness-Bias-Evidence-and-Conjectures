This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break it down:

**Let's Define Our Events**

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is black.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

**What We Know**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that the attacker is black (based on the city's population).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as black, given that they are black.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as black, given that they are not black.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To calculate P(B), we need the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

Where:

* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability that the attacker is not black.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.**
