This is a classic example of how our intuition about probabilities can be misleading. Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (the attacker is black based on the city's demographics) with the new evidence (the witness's testimony).

**Terminology:**

* **Prior probability (P(B)):** The probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's demographics (15%).
* **Likelihood (P(E|B)):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually black (80%).
* **Likelihood (P(E|W)):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, given that the attacker is actually white (20%). This is the error rate.
* **Posterior probability (P(B|E)):** The probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / [P(E|B) * P(B) + P(E|W) * P(W)]

Where P(W) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being white).

**Calculation:**

P(B|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(B|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|E) = 0.12 / 0.29 
P(B|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witness's testimony is independent of the actual race of the attacker. In reality, factors like unconscious bias could influence the witness's perception. This example highlights the importance of considering both prior probabilities and the reliability of evidence when making judgments.
