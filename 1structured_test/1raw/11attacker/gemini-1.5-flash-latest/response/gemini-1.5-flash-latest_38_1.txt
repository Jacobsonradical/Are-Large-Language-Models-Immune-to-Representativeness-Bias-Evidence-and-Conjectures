Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

**Key Elements**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of a person in the city being black (15%). This is our baseline assumption.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are actually black (80%).
* **Likelihood of False Identification:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as black, given that they are actually white (20%).

**Bayes' Theorem Formula**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (the probability we want to calculate)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened (likelihood)
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening
* P(B) = Probability of event B happening (this can be calculated using the law of total probability)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being black)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(B|¬A):** 0.20 (likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a white person as black)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.28

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.43, or 43%.
