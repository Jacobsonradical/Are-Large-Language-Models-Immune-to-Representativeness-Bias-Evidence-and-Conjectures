This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem being applied to a real-world problem. Here's how we can break down the calculation:

**Understanding the Variables:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is black.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**What We Know:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black (based on the city's demographics) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are actually black (the witness' accuracy) = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given they are not black (the witness' error rate) = 0.20
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Explanation:**

Even though the witness is only 80% accurate in identifying race, the fact that the city has a much larger white population significantly impacts the final probability.  The updated probability of the attacker being black, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.
