This is a classic example of how to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **B:** The attacker is black.
* **W:** The attacker is white.
* **ID:** The witness identified the attacker as black.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(B) = 0.15** (15% of the population is black)
* **P(W) = 0.85** (85% of the population is white)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(ID | B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black. This is 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).
* **P(ID | W):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is white. This is 0.20 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(B | ID), the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B | ID) = [P(ID | B) * P(B)] / P(ID)

Where P(ID) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(ID) = P(ID | B) * P(B) + P(ID | W) * P(W)

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(ID) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(B | ID) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.**

**Important Note:**  While this calculation helps us update our belief based on the evidence, it's crucial to remember:

* **This is not a definitive proof:**  The witness's identification is not perfect, and there's still a significant chance the attacker is white.
* **Context matters:**  The reliability of the witness's identification might be affected by factors not considered here (e.g., stress levels, lighting, the witness's own biases). 
* **It's important to avoid biases:**  The use of Bayes' Theorem helps us avoid jumping to conclusions based on stereotypes.
