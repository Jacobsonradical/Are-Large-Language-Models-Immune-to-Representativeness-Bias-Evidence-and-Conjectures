This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to a real-world situation. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Understanding the Variables**

* **Prior Probability (P(Black))**: The base probability that the attacker is black, based on the city's population demographics. This is 0.15 (15%).
* **Likelihood (P(Witness says Black | Black))**: The probability that the witness would identify someone as black, given that they are actually black. This is 0.80 (80%).
* **Likelihood (P(Witness says Black | White))**: The probability that the witness would identify someone as black, given that they are actually white. This is 0.20 (20%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness says Black)

To find P(Witness says Black), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker is black and attacker is white):

P(Witness says Black) = [P(Witness says Black | Black) * P(Black)] + [P(Witness says Black | White) * P(White)]
P(Witness says Black) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Black | Witness says Black) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Black | Witness says Black) â‰ˆ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:**

This is an estimate based on the given information. In reality, many other factors could influence the actual probability of the attacker being black. This example highlights the importance of considering both prior probabilities and the reliability of evidence when making judgments.
