This is a classic example of how our brains can be tricked by base rates and how seemingly strong evidence can be misleading. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the correct answer:

**1. Base Rate:**

* The base rate of black people in the city is 15%. This means, in a random sample, there's a 15% chance the attacker is black.

**2. Witness Testimony:**

* The witness is 80% accurate in identifying race under similar conditions. This means:
    * 80% of the time they correctly identify someone as black when they are black.
    * 80% of the time they correctly identify someone as white when they are white.
    * 20% of the time they incorrectly identify someone as black when they are white.
    * 20% of the time they incorrectly identify someone as white when they are black.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker is black) given new evidence (witness testimony). It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being black (A) given the witness identified them as black (B). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black given they are black (80% accurate).
* P(A) = Base rate of black people in the city (15%).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as black. This is trickier to calculate, but we can break it down using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(Attacker is black | Witness said black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** Even though the witness identified the attacker as black, the probability of the attacker actually being black is only about 41.4%. This is because the base rate of black people in the city is significantly lower than the witness's error rate.
