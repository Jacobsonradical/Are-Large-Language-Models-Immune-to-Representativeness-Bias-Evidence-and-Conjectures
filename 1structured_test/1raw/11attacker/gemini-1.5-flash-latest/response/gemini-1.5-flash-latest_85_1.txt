This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how to apply it:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior Probability (P(Black)):** The probability of the attacker being black *before* we consider the witness testimony. This is simply the proportion of black people in the city, which is 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Black | Black)):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker was black, given that the attacker *actually* was black. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Black | White)):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker was black, given that the attacker *actually* was white. This is 0.2 (20% error rate).
* **Posterior Probability (P(Black | Witness Says Black)):** The probability of the attacker being black, *given* the witness said the attacker was black. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(Black | Witness Says Black) = [P(Witness Says Black | Black) * P(Black)] / P(Witness Says Black)
```

**Calculating P(Witness Says Black):**

We need to account for the probability of the witness saying "black" in both scenarios (attacker actually black and attacker actually white):

```
P(Witness Says Black) = [P(Witness Says Black | Black) * P(Black)] + [P(Witness Says Black | White) * P(White)]
P(Witness Says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**Calculating the Posterior Probability:**

```
P(Black | Witness Says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Black | Witness Says Black) â‰ˆ 0.41
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
