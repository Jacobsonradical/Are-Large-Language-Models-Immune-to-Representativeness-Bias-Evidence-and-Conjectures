This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem. Here's how to break down the problem:

**Terminology:**

* **Prior probability:** The probability of an event before any new evidence is considered. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being black is 15% (based on the population distribution).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence given a particular event. In this case, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black is 80%.
* **Posterior probability:** The probability of the event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate – the probability the attacker is black given the witness's identification.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Let's denote:

*  A: The event that the attacker is black.
*  B: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here's how to calculate each part:

* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a black person as black)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (The prior probability of the attacker being black)
* **P(B)**: This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black, regardless of their actual race.  We need to consider both scenarios (attacker is black and attacker is white):
    * P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (probability of witness identifying black given attacker is black)
    * P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying white as black)
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (total probability of witness identifying as black)

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:** Even though the witness is only correct 80% of the time, the fact that the city's population is predominantly white significantly lowers the probability that the attacker is black, despite the witness's identification.
