This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are actually black (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|~A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are not black (20% error rate).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being black (15% of the population).
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (85% of the population).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to consider both cases (attacker is black and attacker is not black):**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
