This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by base rates. Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The witness identified the attacker as black.
* **B:** The attacker is black.

**We need to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is black given the witness identified them as black.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A|B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are black (80% accuracy) = 0.8
* **P(A|~B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as black given they are not black (20% error rate) = 0.2
* **P(B):** The prior probability of the attacker being black (base rate) = 0.15
* **P(~B):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black = 0.85

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

**To find P(A), we use the law of total probability:**

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B)
P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(B|A):**

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
