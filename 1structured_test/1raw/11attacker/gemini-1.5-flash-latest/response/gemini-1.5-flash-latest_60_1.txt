Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is black *given* the witness's testimony. This is a classic example of how prior probabilities (the overall population distribution) and new evidence (the witness's observation) can be combined to update our beliefs.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (the probability we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying to our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is black.
* B: The witness identifies the attacker as black.

We want to find P(A|B). Let's break down the components:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black *given* the attacker is black. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being black, which is 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black. This requires a bit more work, as it includes both cases where the witness is correct and incorrect. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:
    *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**In conclusion:** Given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is black is approximately 41.4%.
