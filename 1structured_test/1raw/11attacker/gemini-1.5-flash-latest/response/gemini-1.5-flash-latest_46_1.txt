Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the racial demographics of the city (85% white, 15% black). This is our prior probability. We also have information about a witness's ability to identify race under similar conditions. This information helps us update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being black) given new evidence (the witness's testimony). 

The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A (attacker is black) given event B (witness testimony)
* P(B|A): The probability of event B (witness testimony) given event A (attacker is black)
* P(A): The prior probability of event A (attacker is black)
* P(B): The prior probability of event B (witness testimony)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Case**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is black
* B: Witness identified the attacker as black

We need to calculate the following:

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being black is 0.15 (15% of the population).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually black is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as black given the attacker is actually white is 0.2 (20% error rate).
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of the attacker not being black (i.e., being white) is 0.85 (85% of the population).

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. It's crucial to remember that this calculation relies on the witness's accuracy and the city's demographics. There are other factors that could influence the actual probability, and this should not be used as definitive proof.
