This is a classic example of how our intuition can be misled by statistics, a phenomenon known as base rate fallacy. Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the correct probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is black, given the witness's testimony. This is a conditional probability problem, often represented as P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for calculating conditional probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A 
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B

**Let's map our problem to Bayes' Theorem:**

* **A:** The attacker is black.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as black.

**Calculating the Components:**

1. **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness saying "black" given the attacker IS black. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%. 
2. **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being black. This is the base rate of black population in the city, 15%.
3. **P(B):**  Probability of the witness saying "black". This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:
   * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(Attacker is Black | Witness says Black) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:**  The witness's testimony does increase the probability of the attacker being black, but the probability is still much lower than what many people intuitively might assume.  This highlights how important it is to consider base rates in probability calculations.
