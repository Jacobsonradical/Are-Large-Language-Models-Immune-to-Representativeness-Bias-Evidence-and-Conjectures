To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness said the attacker is male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, i.e., the general probability that any person is male in the city.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male overall.

We know:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies males as males 80% of the time)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

We need to calculate \( P(W) \) using:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138 \]

Thus, rounding to four decimal places:
{probability: 0.4138}
