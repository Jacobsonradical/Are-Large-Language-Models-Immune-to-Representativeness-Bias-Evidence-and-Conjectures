To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

where:
- \(P(M | W)\) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \(P(W | M)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \(P(M)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \(P(W)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \(P(M) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is male)
- \(P(F) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is female)
- \(P(W | M) = 0.8\) (The witness correctly identifies males as male 80% of the time)
- \(P(W | F) = 0.2\) (The witness incorrectly identifies females as male 20% of the time)

We calculate \(P(W)\) (total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate that the attacker is male is around 0.4138.
