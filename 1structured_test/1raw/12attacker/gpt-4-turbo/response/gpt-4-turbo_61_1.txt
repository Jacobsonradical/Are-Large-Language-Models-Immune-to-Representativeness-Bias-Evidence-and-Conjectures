To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayesian probability which combines the prior probability (based on population gender ratio) with the likelihood (based on witness information).

1. **Prior probability \(P(\text{male})\) and \(P(\text{female})\):**
   - The prior probability that a person is male = \(P(\text{male}) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is male).
   - The prior probability that a person is female = \(P(\text{female}) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is female).

2. **Likelihood of witness identification:**
   - We are told the witness can correctly identify the gender 80% of the time, and makes a mistake 20% of the time.
   - Probability that the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male = \(P(\text{witness says male | male}) = 0.8\).
   - Probability that the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually female = \(P(\text{witness says male | female}) = 0.2\).

3. **Calculation using Bayes' Theorem:**
   
   Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(\text{male | witness says male}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says male | male}) \times P(\text{male})}{P(\text{witness says male})}
   \]

   Where \(P(\text{witness says male})\) can be calculated using total probability:
   \[
   P(\text{witness says male}) = P(\text{witness says male | male}) \times P(\text{male}) + P(\text{witness says male | female}) \times P(\text{female})
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{witness says male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(\text{male | witness says male}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

**Final Answer**: 
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
