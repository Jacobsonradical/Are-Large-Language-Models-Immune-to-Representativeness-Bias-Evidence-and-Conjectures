To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information we have, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W_m \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to the problem:
- The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time irrespective of the actual gender.
- The probability \( P(W_m | M) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male is 80% or 0.8.
- Similarly, \( P(W_m | F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, is 20% or 0.2.
- The prior probabilities \( P(M) \) and \( P(F) \) (probability the attacker is female) from the population proportions are 15% or 0.15 for males and 85% or 0.85 for females.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M)P(M) + P(W_m | F)P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, we format the answer as requested:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
