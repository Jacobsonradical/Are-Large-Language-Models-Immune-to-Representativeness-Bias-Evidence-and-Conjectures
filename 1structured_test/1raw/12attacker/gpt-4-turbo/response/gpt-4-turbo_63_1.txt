To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we use Bayesian statistics. We denote the event that the attacker is male as \( M \) and the event that the attacker is female as \( F \). Let \( W_m \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We have the following probabilities:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is female)
- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male)
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.2 \) (probability witness wrongly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

Where \( P(W_m) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male) can be calculated as:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \times P(M) + P(W_m | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85  \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness statement is estimated to be approximately 0.4138.
