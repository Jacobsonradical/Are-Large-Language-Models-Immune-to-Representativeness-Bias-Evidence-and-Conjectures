To find the probability that the attacker is male given the available information, we use Bayesian probability calculation.

- Let \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male.
- Let \( W \) denote the witness's statement that the attacker is male.

Given:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
  - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
  
- Witnessâ€™s reliability:
  - \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies a male)
  - \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We are looking for \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} 
\]
where
\[ 
P(W) = P(W | M)P(M) + P(W | F)P(F)
\]

Plug in the values:
\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then,
\[ 
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
