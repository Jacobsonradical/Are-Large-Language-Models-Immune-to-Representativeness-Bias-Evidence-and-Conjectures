To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male,
- \( W \) represent the witness's statement that the attacker is male.

We need to compute \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

We know:
- \( P(M) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is male) = 15% = 0.15.
- \( P(F) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is female) = 85% = 0.85.
- \( P(W | M) \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male) = 80% = 0.8.
- \( P(W | F) \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is female) = 20% = 0.2.

The total probability of the witness saying the attacker is male (regardless of the actual gender), \( P(W) \), is computed by the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging this back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
