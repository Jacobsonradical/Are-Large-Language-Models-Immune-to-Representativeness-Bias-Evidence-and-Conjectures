To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

where:
- \( P(M | W_M) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W_M | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W_M) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We can determine each component of the equation:
- \( P(M) \) is given as 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(W_M | M) \) is the probability of correctly identifying a male as male, which is 80%, or 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W_M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This is calculated by considering both the cases when the attacker is actually male and when the attacker is female:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \times P(M) + P(W_M | F) \times P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(F) \) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 85%, or 0.85.
- \( P(W_M | F) \) is the probability of mistakenly identifying a female as male, which is 20%, or 0.2.

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
\[ P(W_M) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M | W_M) \):
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

Formatted answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
