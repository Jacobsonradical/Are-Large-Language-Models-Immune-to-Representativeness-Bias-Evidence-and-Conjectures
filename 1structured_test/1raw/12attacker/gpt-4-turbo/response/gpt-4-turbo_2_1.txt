To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a certain hypothesis based on new evidence. Let:

- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We know:
- \( P(M) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(\neg M) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female, where \( \neg M \) denotes the event that the attacker is not male, i.e., female).
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, so \( P(W | M) \) = 0.8 and \( P(W | \neg M) \) = 0.2 (the chance of the witness incorrectly saying the attacker is male when the attacker is female).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | \neg M) \cdot P(\neg M)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(M | W) \):
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{(0.8) \cdot (0.15)}{(0.8) \cdot (0.15) + (0.2) \cdot (0.85)} \]

Calculating the denominator first:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, the numerator:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Plugging them into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the result can be presented in the requested format:
