To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the attacker being male based on the new information provided by the witness.

Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to the problem:
- The prior probability that the attacker is male, \( P(M) \), is 15% or 0.15. This is because 15% of the population is male.
- The probability that the attacker is female, \( P(F) \), is 85% or 0.85.
- The witness identifies the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80% irrespective of the actual gender. This means:
  - \( P(W|M) \) (probability the witness says male given the attacker is male) is 80% or 0.8.
  - \( P(W|F) \) (probability the witness says male given the attacker is female) is 20% or 0.2 (the error rate).

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(M|W) \), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is male:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that a witness identified the attacker as male and given the accuracy rate of the witness and the population gender statistics, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
