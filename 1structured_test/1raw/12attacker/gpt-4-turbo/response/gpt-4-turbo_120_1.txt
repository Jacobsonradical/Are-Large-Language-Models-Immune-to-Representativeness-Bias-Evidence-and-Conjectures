To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( P(M \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that the attacker is male (population-based prior probability).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

We know from the information that:
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a male).
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).

Using the Law of Total Probability, the denominator \( P(W) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \times P(M) + P(W \mid F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Plugging this all into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.414.
