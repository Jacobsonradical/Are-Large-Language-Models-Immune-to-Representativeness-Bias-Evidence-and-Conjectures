To find the probability that the attacker is male given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) \), the probability that a randomly selected person is male, is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W | M) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender as male when the person is male, is 0.80.
  
We also have:
- \( P(W | F) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female, which is 0.20 (the error rate).

Using the total law of probability, \( P(W) \) can be computed by considering both the cases where the attacker is male and female:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F) \]

where \( P(F) \) is the probability the person is female, \( 1 - P(M) = 0.85 \).

Calculating \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now putting these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is about 0.414.

Thus:

{"probability": 0.414}
