To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness said the attacker is male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies gender as male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)

We also need \( P(W|F) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which would be:
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (since witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we use the law of total probability for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4138.
