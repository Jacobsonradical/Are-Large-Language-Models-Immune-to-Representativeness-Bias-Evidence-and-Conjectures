To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male, which is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which we need to calculate using the law of total probability.

To calculate \( P(W) \), we consider:
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies the male attacker as male = 0.8.
- \( P(W|F) \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male = 20%, or 0.2.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} =0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male would be approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.41}
