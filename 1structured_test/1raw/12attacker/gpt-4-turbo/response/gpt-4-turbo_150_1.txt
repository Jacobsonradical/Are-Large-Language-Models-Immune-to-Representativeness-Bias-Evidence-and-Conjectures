To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male,
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female,
- \( W \) as the witness's statement that the attacker is male.

From the information given:
- The prior probability that the attacker is male, \( P(M) \), is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- The prior probability that the attacker is female, \( P(F) \), is 85% or 0.85.

The witness's ability was assessed, and it's stated that the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. So:
- The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male, \( P(W | M) \), is 80% or 0.8.
- The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female, \( P(W | F) \), is 20% (error rate) or 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as male, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F)
\]
Substituting in the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witnessâ€™s statement, is approximately 0.4138.
