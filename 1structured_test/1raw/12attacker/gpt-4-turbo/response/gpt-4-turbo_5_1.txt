To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this scenario tells us how to update our initial belief about the probabilities of the attacker's gender (prior probabilities) in light of new evidence (the witness's testimony).

We denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male,
- \( W_M \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- The prior probability the attacker is male (\( P(M) \)) is \( 0.15 \) (15% male population).
- The prior probability the attacker is female (\( P(F) \)) is \( 0.85 \) (85% female population).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (\( P(W_M | M) \)) is \( 0.80 \) (witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (\( P(W_M | F) \)) is \( 0.20 \) (witness makes an error 20% of the time).

We need to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

where \( P(W_M) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F)
\]
\[
P(W_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

So, the formatted answer would be:
{probability: 0.4138}
