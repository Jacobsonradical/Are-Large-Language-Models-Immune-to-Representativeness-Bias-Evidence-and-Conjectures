To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context relates the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony, to the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the gender, the prior probability of the attacker being male, and the total probability of the witness's testimony. 

Let's denote the following:
- \( M \) = event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) = event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_M \) = event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is male)
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is female)
3. \( P(W_M | M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W_M | F) = 0.2 \) (witness wrongly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

Where \( P(W_M) \) (total probability of the witness identifying someone as male) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \times P(M) + P(W_M | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
