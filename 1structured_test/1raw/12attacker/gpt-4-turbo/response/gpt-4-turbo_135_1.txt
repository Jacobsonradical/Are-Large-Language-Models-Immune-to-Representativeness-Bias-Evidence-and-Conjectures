To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the distribution of a variable (in this case, gender) in light of new evidence (the witness identification).

Let \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male and \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

From the provided information:
- \( P(W | M) = 80\% = 0.80 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies a male)
- \( P(W | F) = 20\% = 0.20 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- \( P(M) = 15\% = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a person is male)
- \( P(F) = 85\% = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a person is female)

Using the law of total probability for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.414.
