To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population gender distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male and let \( W \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

1. **\( P(M) \) (Prior probability of attacker being male)**:
   From the given data, 15% of the population is male.
   \[
   P(M) = 0.15
   \]

2. **\( P(F) \) (Prior probability of attacker being female)**:
   Similarly, since 85% of the population is female.
   \[
   P(F) = 0.85
   \]

3. **\( P(W|M) \) (Probability of witness identifying the attacker as male given they are male)**:
   Given the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
   \[
   P(W|M) = 0.80
   \]

4. **\( P(W|F) \) (Probability of witness identifying the attacker as male given they are female)**:
   Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases.
   \[
   P(W|F) = 0.20
   \]

5. **\( P(W) \) (Total probability that witness identifies the attacker as male)**:
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

Putting it all together:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.

Hence:
{probability: 0.414}
