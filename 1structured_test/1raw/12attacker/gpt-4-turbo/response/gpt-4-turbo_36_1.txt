To estimate the probability that the attacker is male using the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to reverse conditional probabilities when you know certain other probabilities.

Let's define:
- \( M \) as the event "attacker is male"
- \( W \) as the event "witness identifies the attacker as male"

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies male as male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(W | M^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, where \( M^c \) is the complement of \( M \), i.e., the attacker is female)
- \( P(M^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | M^c) \times P(M^c)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
And thus:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.
