To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem, a fundamental theorem in probability theory. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
where:

- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the initial probability that the attacker is male (i.e., prior probability, which is 15% or 0.15 here due to given city demographics).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Given \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (because when the attacker is male, witness correctly identifies as male 80% of the time) and also:
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (because when the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies as male 20% of the time).

Bayes' Theorem incorporates these probabilities:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying "male":
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
