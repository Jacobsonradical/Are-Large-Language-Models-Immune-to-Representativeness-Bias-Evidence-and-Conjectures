To solve this probability problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is stated as:

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(M \mid W)\) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \(P(W \mid M)\) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
- \(P(M)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \(P(W)\) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \(P(W \mid M) = 0.8\) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \(P(M) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is male)
  
Since the witness may wrongly identify a female as male:
- \(P(W \mid F) = 0.2\) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- \(P(F) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is female)

Now we calculate \(P(W)\), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male, using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M) \times P(M) + P(W \mid F) \times P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
