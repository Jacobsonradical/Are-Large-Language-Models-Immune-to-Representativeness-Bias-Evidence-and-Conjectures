To find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is defined as:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is male (prior probability of being male).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male (total probability).

From the information provided:
- \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, \( P(W) \), can be computed by the law of total probability as follows:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging in these values into Bayes' Theorem, we get:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
    
Therefore, the answer:

{probability: 0.4138}
