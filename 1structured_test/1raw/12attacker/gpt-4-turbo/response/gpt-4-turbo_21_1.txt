To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let M denote the event that the attacker is male and F the event that the attacker is female. We are given:

1. The probability of a randomly selected person being male (P(M)) is 15%, or 0.15.
2. The probability of a randomly selected person being female (P(F)) is 85%, or 0.85.
3. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (P(W|M)) is 80%, or 0.8.
4. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (P(W|F)) is 20%, or 0.2 (since the witness has an 80% accuracy rate but the remaining 20% includes cases where females are identified as males).
5. We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male (P(M|W)).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]

Calculating P(W):
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating P(M|W):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, after having the information from the witness, the updated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
