To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population gender distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male,
- \( W \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- The witness identifies male correctly 80% of the time when the person is indeed male, \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \).
- The witness identifies male incorrectly 20% of the time when the person is female, \( P(W|\neg M) = 0.2 \).
- 15% of the population is male, so \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
- 85% of the population is female, so \( P(\neg M) = 0.85 \).

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), which is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification of the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem,

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

Here, \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|M) P(M) + P(W|\neg M) P(\neg M)
\]

Substituting the given values,

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is about 0.414.
