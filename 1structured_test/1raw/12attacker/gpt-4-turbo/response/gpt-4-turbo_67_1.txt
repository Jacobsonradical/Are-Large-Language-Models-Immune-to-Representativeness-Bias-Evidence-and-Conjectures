To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid B) \): Probability of \( A \) given \( B \), the probability the attacker is male given that a witness said they are male.
- \( P(B \mid A) \): The probability of observing \( B \) given \( A \), the probability that the witness says the attacker is male when the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of \( A \), the probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of \( B \), the probability that the witness says the attacker is male.

We have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

We also need:
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(B \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

The total probability of \( B \) (witness states the attacker is male) is:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:
\[ \{ "probability" : 0.41379 \} \]
