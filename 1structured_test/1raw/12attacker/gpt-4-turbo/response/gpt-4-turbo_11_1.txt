To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information we have, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let $M$ be the event that the attacker is male, and $W$ be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is male, $P(M) = 0.15$
- The probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is female, $P(F) = 0.85$
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, $P(W \mid M) = 0.8$
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male (assuming the attacker is actually female), $P(W \mid F) = 0.2$ (the witness has the same error rate regardless of the gender)

We want to find $P(M \mid W)$, the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes’ Theorem:

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M)P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

We need to calculate $P(W)$, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male overall. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M)P(M) + P(W \mid F)P(F) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, plug these values back into Bayes’ Theorem:

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately $0.4138$. 

Therefore, the answer is:
