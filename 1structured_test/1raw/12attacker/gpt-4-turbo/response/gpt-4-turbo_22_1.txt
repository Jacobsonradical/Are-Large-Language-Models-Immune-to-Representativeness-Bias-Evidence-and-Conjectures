To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We denote events as follows:
- M = attacker is male.
- F = attacker is female.
- W = witness identifies the attacker as male.

The theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

From the information given:
1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
3. \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as male, when they are male)
4. \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as male, when they are female)

We can compute \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
