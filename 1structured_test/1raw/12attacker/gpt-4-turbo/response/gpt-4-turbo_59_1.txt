To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence. Here, our prior belief is the percentage of males in the population, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony about the attacker's gender.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that the attacker is male (P(Male)): 0.15 (15%)
   - Probability that the attacker is female (P(Female)): 0.85 (85%)

2. **Witness's accuracy**:
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (P(Witness says Male | Male)): 0.80 
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (P(Witness says Male | Female)): 0.20

3. **Total probability that the witness says the attacker is male**:
   - We use the Law of Total Probability to find this:
   \[
   P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male | Female}) \times P(\text{Female})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem to find the probability the attacker is male given the witness says male**:
   \[
   P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
