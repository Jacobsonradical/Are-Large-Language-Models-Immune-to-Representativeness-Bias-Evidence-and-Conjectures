To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence.

Let \(M\) be the event that the attacker is male, and \(W\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We know:
- \(P(M)\) (the prior probability that the attacker is male) = 15% = 0.15.
- \(P(\text{not } M)\) (the prior probability that the attacker is female) = 85% = 0.85.

From the witness's ability:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, \(P(W | M)\), is 80% = 0.8.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, \(P(W | \text{not } M)\), is 20% = 0.2.

We want to calculate \(P(M | W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be computed by summing the probabilities of the witness identifying someone as male, whether they are actually male or female:

\[
P(W) = P(W | M)P(M) + P(W | \text{not} M)P(\text{not} M)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.
