To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( M \) = Probabilty that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) = Probability that a witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given data:
- Prior probability \( P(M) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- Prior probability \( P(F) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
- Conditional probability \( P(W|M) \) = 0.8 (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male).
- Conditional probability \( P(W|F) \) = 0.2 (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female).

First, we need to calculate the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We do this using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
     = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M|W) \) (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male):

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
        = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
        = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
        \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
