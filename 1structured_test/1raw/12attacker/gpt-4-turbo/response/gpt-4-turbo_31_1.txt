To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \(M\) = event the attacker is male.
- \(F\) = event the attacker is female.
- \(W\) = event the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(M | W)\) is the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \(P(W | M)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is given as 80% or 0.8.
- \(P(M)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city’s demographics.

We also need to find \(P(W)\), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F) \]

Where:
- \(P(W | F)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is the probability of a mistake, given as 20% or 0.2.
- \(P(F)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the city’s demographics.

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting values back into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is about 0.41.

Therefore the result in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.41}
