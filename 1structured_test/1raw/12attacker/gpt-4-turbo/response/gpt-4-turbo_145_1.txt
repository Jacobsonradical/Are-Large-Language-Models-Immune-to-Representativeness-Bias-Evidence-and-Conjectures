To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male given this information, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior probability estimate about the attacker being male (based on the general population in the city) with the additional information provided by the witness.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- Prior probability that the attacker is male, \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- Prior probability that the attacker is female, \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- The witness correctly identifies someone's gender 80% of the time:
  - \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male).
  - \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female).

We need to compute \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. Applying Bayes' Theorem, we get:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of the actual gender), use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can compute \( P(M | W) \):

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
