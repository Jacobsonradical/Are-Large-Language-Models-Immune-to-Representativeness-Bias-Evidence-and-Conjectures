To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the two pieces of information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness}) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Male}) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as male. We know from the information that this is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(\text{Male}) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% or 0.15, based on the general population of the city.
- \( P(\text{Witness}) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be derived as follows:
  
\[ P(\text{Witness}) = P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]

Here:
- \( P(\text{Female}) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female. Since 85% of the population is female, \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Female}) \) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male by the witness. The witness is incorrect about gender identification in 20% of cases, so \( P(\text{Witness} \mid \text{Female}) = 0.2 \).

Now we calculate:

\[ P(\text{Witness}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore, we can find:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
