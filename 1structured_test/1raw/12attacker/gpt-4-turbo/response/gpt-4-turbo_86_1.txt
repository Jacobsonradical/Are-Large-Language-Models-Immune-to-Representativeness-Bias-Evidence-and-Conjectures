To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which enables us to update our probability estimate of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's the process:

1. **Identify initial probabilities**:
   - Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
   - \( P(M) \) = Probability that a randomly selected person from the population is male = 15% = 0.15.
   - \( P(\neg M) \) = Probability that a randomly selected person is not male (i.e., female) = 85% = 0.85.

2. **Determine conditional probabilities based on witness's testimony**:
   - Given the conditions similar to that night, the witness:
     - Correctly identifies male as male 80% of the time.
     - Erroneously identifies female as male 20% of the time.
   - We denote the witness identifying the attacker as male as \( W \).
   - \( P(W | M) \) = Probability witness identifies male given the attacker is male = 0.8.
   - \( P(W | \neg M) \) = Probability witness identifies male given the attacker is female = 0.2.

3. **Use Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' Theorem states: \( P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \).
   - We need \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is male:
     \( P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | \neg M) \times P(\neg M) \)
     \( P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \)
     \( P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

4. **Calculate \( P(M | W) \)**:
   \( P(M | W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \)
   \( P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

**Final answer**:
