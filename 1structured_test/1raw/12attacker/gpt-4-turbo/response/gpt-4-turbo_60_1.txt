To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male, we use Bayes' theorem. Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

From the information given:
1. \( P(W|M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male, is 0.8 (80%).
2. \( P(M) \), the prior probability that the attacker is male based solely on the population distribution, is 0.15 (15% are male).

We also need \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F)
\]
where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
- \( P(F) \), the probability that the attacker is female, is 0.85 (85% of the population is female).

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.414}
