To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( M \) = event that the attacker is male.
- \( W_M \) = event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Based on the data:
- \( P(W_M | M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male, is 80% (0.8).
- \( P(W_M | F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, is 20% (0.2), since the witness makes an error in assessing gender 20% of the time.
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability that a person is male, is 15% (0.15) as given.
- \( P(F) \), the prior probability that a person is female, is 85% (0.85).

We need to calculate \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

where \( P(W_M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of the true gender), can be calculated as:

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \times P(M) + P(W_M | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

The estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer:

{probability: 0.4138}
