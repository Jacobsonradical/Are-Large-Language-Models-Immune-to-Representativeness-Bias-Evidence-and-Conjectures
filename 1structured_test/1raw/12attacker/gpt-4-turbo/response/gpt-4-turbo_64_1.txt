To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we utilize Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the distribution of males and females in the population, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's gender.

Let:
- \( P(M) \) be the probability the attacker is male,
- \( P(F) \) be the probability the attacker is female,
- \( P(W | M) \) be the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male,
- \( P(W | F) \) be the probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female.

From the given data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male),
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female),
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time if male),
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (witness erringly identifies gender 20% of the time as male if female).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which includes both the true positives and false positives:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) 
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, \( P(M | W) \) becomes:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the final response should be:
{probability: 0.4138}
