To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. As per the witness's reliability, this is 0.8 (80% correct identification when the attacker is male).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
  
  Here:
  - \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, or 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
  - \( P(W | F) \) is the probability that the witness wrongly identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Hence, substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.4138}
