To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence from the witness and the population distribution of males and females in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid B) \) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is truly male.
- \( P(A) \) is the initial probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the data:
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a male)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that any person, hence the attacker, is male in the city)
- \( P(B \mid A') = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \) (probability that any person, hence the attacker, is female in the city)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A') P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification is:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
