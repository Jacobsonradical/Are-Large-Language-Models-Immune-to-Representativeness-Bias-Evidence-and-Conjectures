To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) denote the event that a witness identifies the attacker as male.

Based on the given data:
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability that a random person (and thus the attacker) is male, is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W | M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W | F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, is 20% or 0.2 due to the error rate of the witness. We use complement rules because the witness functioning correctly would identify a female as female, but errs this percentage of the time.

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is approximately 0.4138, or about 41.38%.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
