To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the conditions mentioned, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

The probability that the attacker is identified as male can be obtained using the total probability law:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]

where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 85% or 0.85.

So, calculating \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is about 0.4138 or 41.38%.
