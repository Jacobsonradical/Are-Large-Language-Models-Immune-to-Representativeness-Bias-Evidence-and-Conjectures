To solve this, we will apply Bayes' theorem, which helps update our prior belief based on new evidence. We know:

1. The witness accuracy (P(Correct | Male) and P(Correct | Female)): 80% correct identification and 20% error.
2. The population base rates (Prior probabilities, P(Male) and P(Female)): 15% male and 85% female.

Let's denote:
- M = Male attacker
- F = Female attacker
- W = Witness says attacker is male

We need to find P(M | W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, calculate the likelihoods using the witness's accuracy (likelihoods):
- P(W | M) = Probability that witness correctly identifies a male as male = 0.8,
- P(W | F) = Probability that witness incorrectly identifies a female as male = 0.2.

Next, using the population base rates (priors):
- P(M) = Probability that a random person is male = 0.15,
- P(F) = Probability that a random person is female = 0.85.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is:
{
  "probability": 0.414
