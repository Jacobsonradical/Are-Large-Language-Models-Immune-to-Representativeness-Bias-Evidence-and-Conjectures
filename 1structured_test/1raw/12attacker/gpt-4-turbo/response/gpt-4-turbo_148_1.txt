To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayesian inference:

Let M be the event that the attacker is male.

**Given data:**
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as male)
- \( P(W|\neg M) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Base rate of males in the population)
- \( P(\neg M) = 0.85 \) (Base rate of females in the population)

We are interested in \( P(M|W) \) — the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

**Using Bayes’ Theorem:**
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M)P(M)}{P(W)} \]
where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|\neg M)P(\neg M) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, plug \( P(W) \) back into Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138. 

Therefore, the answer can be formatted as:
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
