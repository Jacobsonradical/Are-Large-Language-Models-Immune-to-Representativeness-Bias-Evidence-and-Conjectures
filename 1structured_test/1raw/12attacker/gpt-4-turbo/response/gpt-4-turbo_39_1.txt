To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability witness correctly identifies a male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Using the Law of Total Probability for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, plugging these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the response in the specified format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
