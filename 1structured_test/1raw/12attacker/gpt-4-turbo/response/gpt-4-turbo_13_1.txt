To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as follows:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M)P(M)}{P(W)} \]
where 
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is truly male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that any given individual is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is female)

Since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (probability witness identifies male when attacker is male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (probability witness identifies male when attacker is female)

Then, the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as male is:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that the person is male given the witness's identification can be calculated as:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M)P(M)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 * 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified them as such, is approximately:
{ "probability": 0.41379 }
