To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps in computing the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's define:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that a witness identifies the attacker as male

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W | M) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(W | F) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to find P(M | W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where, 
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.

{probability: 0.414}
