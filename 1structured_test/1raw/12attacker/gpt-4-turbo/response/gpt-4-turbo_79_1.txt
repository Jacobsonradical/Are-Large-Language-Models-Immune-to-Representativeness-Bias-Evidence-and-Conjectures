To solve this, we can use Bayesian probability analysis. Let's define the following variables:

- Let M represent the event that the attacker is male.
- Let F represent the event that the attacker is female.
- Let W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know:
- The probability that the witness identifies a person as male given they are male (P(W|M)) = 0.8
- The probability that the witness identifies a person as male given they are female (P(W|F)) = 0.2 
- The probability that a person is male (P(M)) = 15% or 0.15
- The probability that a person is female (P(F)) = 85% or 0.85

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to calculate P(M|W), or the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where P(W), or the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, inserting these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

Formatted answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
