To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the data:
1. \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies the gender as male 80% of the time)
2. \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the gender as male 20% of the time when the attacker is female)
3. Population probabilities are: \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% are male) and \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% are female).

Now to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) P(M) + P(W \mid F) P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Then, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
