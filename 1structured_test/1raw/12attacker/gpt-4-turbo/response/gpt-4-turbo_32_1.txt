To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Letâ€™s define:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to compute \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We know:
- \( P(W|M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability that any randomly selected person from the city is male, which is 15% (or 0.15).
- We can also calculate \( P(W|F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% (since the witness makes an error in such cases, or 0.2).
- \( P(F) \), the prior probability that any randomly selected person from the city is female, which is 85% (or 0.85).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
Where \( P(W) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, \( P(M|W) \) is:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Converting this to a more readable format:
{
  "probability": 0.4138
