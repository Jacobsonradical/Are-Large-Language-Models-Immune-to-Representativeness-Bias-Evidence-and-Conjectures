To solve this problem, we can use Bayesâ€™ theorem. Bayes' theorem enables us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, our prior belief is the probability distribution of gender in the population, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's gender.

Let:
- M be the event the attacker is male.
- F be the event the attacker is female.
- W be the event the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is male).
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is female, i.e., the error rate).
- P(M) = 0.15 (prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is male).
- P(F) = 0.85 (prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is female).

We are interested in finding P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the person as male.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can occur if either the attacker is actually male and is identified correctly, or the attacker is female and is identified incorrectly. This is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, calculating \( P(M|W) \):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
