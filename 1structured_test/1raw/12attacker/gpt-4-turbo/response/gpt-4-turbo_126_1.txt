To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) represent the event that a witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the statement:
1. The prior probability \( P(M) \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is male) is 15%, or 0.15.
2. The prior probability \( P(F) \) that the attacker is female is 85%, or 0.85.
3. The probability \( P(W|M) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is 80%, or 0.80.
4. The probability \( P(W|F) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female is 20%, or 0.20.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
