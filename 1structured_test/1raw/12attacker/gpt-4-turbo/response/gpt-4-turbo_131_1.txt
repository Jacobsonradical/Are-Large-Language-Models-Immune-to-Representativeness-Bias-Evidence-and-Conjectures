To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to the given data:
- The prior probability \( P(M) \), that the attacker is male, is 15% (since 15% of the population is male). This is \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
- The prior probability that the attacker is female \( P(F) \) is 85% (since 85% of the population is female). This is \( P(F) = 0.85 \).
- The accuracy of the witness in correctly identifying a male is given as 80%. Therefore, \( P(W | M) \) = 0.80.
- The probability of the witness erroneously identifying someone as male when they are actually female is also given as 20%. Thus, \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(M | W) \) - the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, can be computed using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F) \]
  \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.414.

**Answer**: {probability: 0.414}
