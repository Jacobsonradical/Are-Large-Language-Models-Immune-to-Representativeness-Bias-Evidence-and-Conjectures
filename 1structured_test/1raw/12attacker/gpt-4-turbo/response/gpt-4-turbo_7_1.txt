To solve this problem, we use the concept of Bayesian probability. We start by defining the events and applying Bayes' rule:

- Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(\neg M) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time:
  - \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male)
  - \( P(W|\neg M) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female)
  
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male), we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|\neg M) \times P(\neg M)
\]

Plugging in the values, we find:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate that the attacker is male based on the witness's identification under the given conditions is:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]

Rounded to four decimal places or expressed as a percentage, this would be about 41.38% chance that the attacker is male.
