To determine the probability that the attacker is male (\( P(M) \)), given the witness's testimony that the attacker is male (\( E \)), we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(M \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(M \mid E) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(E \mid M) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability the attacker is male.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is male.

From the scenario: 
- The witness correctly identifies the gender (male or female) 80% of the time. Thus, \( P(E \mid M) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness says male given the attacker is male).
- \( P(M) \) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(E \mid F) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (the error rate).
- \( P(F) \) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).

First, we compute \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(E \mid F) \cdot P(F) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:
