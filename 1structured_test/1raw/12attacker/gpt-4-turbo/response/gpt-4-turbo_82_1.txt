To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population's gender distribution, we use Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- M = event the attacker is male.
- W = event the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Based on the information provided:
- Prior probability \(P(M)\) (that a randomly selected person from the population is male) = 15% = 0.15.
- Prior probability \(P(\text{female})\) (that a randomly selected person is female) = 85% = 0.85.
- Likelihood \(P(W | M)\) (witness identifies the attacker as male given that they are male) = 80% = 0.8.
- Likelihood \(P(W | \text{female})\) (witness identifies the attacker as male given that they are female) = 20% = 0.2 (since this is the error rate of identifying gender).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we compute the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
where
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | \text{female}) \times P(\text{female}) \] 
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification:
{probability: 0.4138}
