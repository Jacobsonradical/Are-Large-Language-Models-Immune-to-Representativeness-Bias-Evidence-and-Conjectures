To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the available information, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male,
- \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(W|M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, is 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in correctly identifying males).
- \( P(W|\neg M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, is 20% or 0.2 (the witness's error rate in misidentifying females as males).

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|\neg M) \times P(\neg M)
\]
Inserting the values we have:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
So, plugging everything into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately \( 0.414 \).
