To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior knowledge based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \) as the probability the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(F) \) as the probability the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability the witness correctly identifies a male, given the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, given the attacker is female, which is 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is male. It is calculated as:
  \[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
  \[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Therefore, applying Bayes' theorem, we find:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and the demographic distribution of gender in the city, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:
