To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior beliefs (the probabilities before knowing additional evidence) with new evidence to obtain a posterior probability.

Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the data given:
- Prior probability \( P(M) \) (probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is male) = 15% or 0.15.
- Prior probability \( P(F) \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is female) = 85% or 0.85.
- The witness correctly identifies male gender 80% of the time: \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time: \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, we find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M)P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where 
\[
P(W) = P(W | M)P(M) + P(W | F)P(F) 
\]
is the total probability of the witness reporting that the attacker is male.

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
