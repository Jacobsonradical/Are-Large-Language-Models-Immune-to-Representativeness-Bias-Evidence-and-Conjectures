We will use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's identification and the demographic distribution of the population.

1. **Definitions**:
   - Let \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male.
   - Let \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(M) \) (prior probability of the attacker being male) = \( 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
   - \( P(F) \) (prior probability of the attacker being female) = \( 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).

3. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(W|M) \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are male) = \( 0.80 \) (witness's accuracy).
   - \( P(W|F) \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are female) = \( 0.20 \) (witness's error rate).

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayes' theorem states that:
   \[
   P(M|W) = \dfrac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
   \]
   Calculating \( P(W) \):
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80) \times (0.15) + (0.20) \times (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.170 = 0.290
   \]
   Now calculating \( P(M|W) \):
   \[
   P(M|W) = \dfrac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.290} = \dfrac{0.12}{0.290} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately \( 0.414 \).
