To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the above information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that a random person in the city is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]
  Here:
  - \( P(W \mid F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is female (i.e., witness's error rate in identifying females as males), which is 20% or 0.2.
  - \( P(F) \) is the probability that a random person in the city is female, which is 85% or 0.85.

By substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply these to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness' identification is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
