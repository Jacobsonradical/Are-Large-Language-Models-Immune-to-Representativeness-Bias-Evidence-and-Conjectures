To find the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male, and \( W \) represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is male.

Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

From the data:
1. \( P(M) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is male) is 15%, or 0.15.
2. \( P(F) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is female) is 85%, or 0.85.
3. \( P(W \mid M) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male) is 80%, or 0.8.
4. \( P(W \mid F) \) (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female) is 20%, or 0.2.

We also need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be found by the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M) \times P(M) + P(W \mid F) \times P(F)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Finally, by substituting these back into Bayes' Theorem,
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
