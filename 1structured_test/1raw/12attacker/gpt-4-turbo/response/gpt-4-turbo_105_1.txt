To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates with new information.

We are given:
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (Probability the population is female)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Probability the population is male)
- A witness claims the attacker is male. We are given the witness's accuracy:
  - \( P(\text{Identify male | Is male}) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(\text{Identify male | Is female}) = 0.20 \)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, \( P(M | \text{Identify male}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M | \text{Identify male}) = \frac{P(\text{Identify male} | M) \times P(M)}{P(\text{Identify male})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Identify male}) = P(\text{Identify male} | M) \times P(M) + P(\text{Identify male} | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(\text{Identify male}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identify male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging it into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | \text{Identify male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | \text{Identify male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that a witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
