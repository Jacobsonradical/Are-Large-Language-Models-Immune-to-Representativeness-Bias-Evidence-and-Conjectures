To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is male) in light of new evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, assuming that the attacker is male).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the initial likelihood that the attacker is male, based only on the population distribution).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence (the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male under any circumstances).

First, let's determine each of these probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male (15% of the population).
   \[ P(M) = 0.15 \]
  
2. \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female (85% of the population).
   \[ P(F) = 0.85 \]
  
3. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
   \[ P(E|M) = 0.80 \]

4. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. The witness makes an error in gender identification 20% of the time.
   \[ P(E|F) = 0.20 \]
  
Now, we compute \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|M) \times P(M) + P(E|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M|E) \):
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M) \times P(M)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is about 0.4138.

Answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
