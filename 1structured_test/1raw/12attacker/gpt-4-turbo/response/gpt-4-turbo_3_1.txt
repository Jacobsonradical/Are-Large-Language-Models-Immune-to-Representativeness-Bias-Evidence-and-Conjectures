To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

**Bayes' theorem** states:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

From the information provided:
- **Prior probability** \( P(M) \): 15% of the population is male, hence \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
- **Likelihood** \( P(W \mid M) \): The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, thus \( P(W \mid M) = 0.8 \).
- **Marginal probability** \( P(W) \): This is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
  - \( P(W) = P(W \mid M) P(M) + P(W \mid F) P(F) \)
  - The probability of mistaking a female for a male (false positive) is also 20% since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so \( P(W \mid F) = 0.2 \).
  - Since 85% of the population is female, \( P(F) = 0.85 \).

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug in these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness has identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.
