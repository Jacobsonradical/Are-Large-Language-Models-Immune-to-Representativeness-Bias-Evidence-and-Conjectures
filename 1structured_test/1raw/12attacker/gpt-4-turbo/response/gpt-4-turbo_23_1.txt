To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:
- \(M\) as the event the attacker is male
- \(F\) as the event the attacker is female
- \(W\) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as male

According to the information provided:
- \(P(M) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is male)
- \(P(F) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is female)

Now, we have to consider how well the witness can identify the gender:
- When the witness sees a male, they correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. Thus, \(P(W|M) = 0.8\).
- When the witness sees a female, they incorrectly identify the gender as male 20% of the time. Thus, \(P(W|F) = 0.2\).

We want to find \(P(M|W)\), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \(P(W)\), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
