To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information above, we can use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, Bayes' theorem can be written as:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

The witness identifies the gender correctly 80% of the time (whether the person is male or female) and errs 20% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability witness says male given male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability witness says male given female)

We calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
