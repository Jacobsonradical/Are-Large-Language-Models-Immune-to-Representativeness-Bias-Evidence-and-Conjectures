To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem will help us update our prior belief about the gender distribution in the population with the new information provided by the witness.

Let:
- \( M \) = the event that the attacker is male
- \( W \) = the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the problem:
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (probability witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male)
- \( P(W | M^c) = 0.20 \) (probability witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is male based on population, where 15% of the population is male)
- \( P(M^c) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is female)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | M^c) \times P(M^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting all the known values back into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and considering the population's gender distribution, is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer in the required format is:
```
{probability: 0.4138}
