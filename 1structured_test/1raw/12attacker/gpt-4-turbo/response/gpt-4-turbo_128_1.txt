To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior belief (in this case, the demographic distribution of gender in the city) in light of new evidence (the witness's identification). 

Given:
- P(M) = Probability the attacker is male = 15% = 0.15
- P(F) = Probability the attacker is female = 85% = 0.85
- P(Witness identifies as Male | Male) = Probability the witness identifies someone as male when they are actually male = 80% = 0.8
- P(Witness identifies as Male | Female) = Probability the witness identifies someone as male when they are actually female = 20% = 0.2

We want to find P(Male | Witness identifies as Male), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Male | Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = \frac{P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male | Male) \times P(Male)}{P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male)} \]

To find P(Witness identifies as Male), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male | Male) \times P(Male) + P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male | Female) \times P(Female) \]
\[ P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Male | Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Male | Witness\ identifies\ as\ Male) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
