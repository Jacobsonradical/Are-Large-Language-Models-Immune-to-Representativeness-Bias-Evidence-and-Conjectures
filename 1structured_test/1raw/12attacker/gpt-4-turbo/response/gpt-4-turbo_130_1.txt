To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony and the gender distribution in the city, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in revising the probability of an event based on new evidence. Let's define:

- Let \( M \) be the event the attacker is male.
- Let \( F \) be the event the attacker is female.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.
  
According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
- \( P(M \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified as male (what we're looking for).
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (without considering the witness's testimony).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

2. **Conditional Probabilities**:
   - \( P(W \mid M) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies gender as male 80% of the time when the attacker is male)
   - \( P(W \mid F) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies gender as male 20% of the time when the attacker is female, i.e., mistakes a female for a male)

3. **Calculating \( P(W) \)**, the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
   \( P(W) = P(W \mid M) P(M) + P(W \mid F) P(F) \)
   \( P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \)
   \( P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \( P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} \)
   \( P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \)
   \( P(M \mid W) ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138 \)

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, our answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
