To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior belief about a probability (in this case, the proportion of males and females in the population) based on new evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker as male).

The given information is:
- The population consists of 85% females and 15% males. Therefore:
  - \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) 
  - \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \)
- A witness who, when tested, correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time.

We compute \( P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) \) and \( P(\text{Witness says Male | Female}) \) as follows:
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) = 0.80 \) (probability witness is correct)
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male | Female}) = 0.20 \) (probability witness is incorrect)

We want to find \( P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) \), the probability that the person is male given that the witness identified the person as male. Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is male, which is computed by the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male | Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male | Female}) \cdot P(\text{Female}) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male | Witness says Male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
