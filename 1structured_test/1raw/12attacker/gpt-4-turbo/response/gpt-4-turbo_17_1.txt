To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities among events. Specifically, we need to find \( P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness says Male}) \) â€” the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Define:
- \( M \) as the event the attacker is male,
- \( F \) as the event the attacker is female,
- \( W_M \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male),
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female),
- \( P(W_M \mid M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time),
- \( P(W_M \mid F) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{P(W_M \mid M)P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

Where \( P(W_M) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M \mid M)P(M) + P(W_M \mid F)P(F) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Rounded up, this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness said the attacker is male:
\[
\text{{probability}}: 0.4138
\]
