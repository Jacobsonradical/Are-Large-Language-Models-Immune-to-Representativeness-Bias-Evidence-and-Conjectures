To solve this problem, we can make use of Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our probability estimate for the gender of the attacker based on the witness's identification. Here's how we can apply it in this context:

1. Let \( M \) denote that the attacker is male, and \( F \) that the attacker is female.
2. Given prior probabilities:
   \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

3. The witnessâ€™s reliability:
   - If the person is male, the probability that the witness correctly identifies as male \( P(\text{witness says male} | M) = 0.8 \)
   - If the person is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies as male \( P(\text{witness says male} | F) = 0.2 \)

4. Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | \text{witness says male}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says male} | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(\text{witness says male})} \]

5. To find \( P(\text{witness says male}) \):
\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = P(\text{witness says male} | M) \cdot P(M) + P(\text{witness says male} | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

6. Substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | \text{witness says male}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | \text{witness says male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, based on the witness's testament and the known demographics of the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is about 0.414.

Thus, in response:

{probability: 0.414}
