To solve this, we use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is male. 

1. Define variables:
   - \( P(M) \) = Probability attacker is male = 15% = 0.15 (from data)
   - \( P(F) \) = Probability attacker is female = 85% = 0.85 (from data)
   - \( P(W|M) \) = Probability witness correctly identifies a male as male = 80% = 0.8 (from witness accuracy)
   - \( P(W|F) \) = Probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male = 20% = 0.2 (from witness error rate)

2. Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where \( P(W) \) (probability witness says "male") is calculated as:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
   \]
   Substituting the values we get:
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]
   Now, using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Hence the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
