To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our probability estimates based on new evidence. Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male and \( W \) the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We need to calculate \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time:
  - \( P(W \mid M) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male).
  - \( P(W \mid \text{Female}) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female).

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M)P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given by the total law of probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M)P(M) + P(W \mid \text{Female})P(\text{Female})
\]

Plugging in the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
