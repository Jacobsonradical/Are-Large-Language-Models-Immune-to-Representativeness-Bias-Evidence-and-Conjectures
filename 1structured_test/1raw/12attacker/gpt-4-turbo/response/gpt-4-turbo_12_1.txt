To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) based on new evidence (likelihoods).

Let:
- \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) represent the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

The reliability of the witness when identifying gender:
- Probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male: \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \)
- Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male: \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(M|W) \) (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male):

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
\]

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, calculating \( P(M|W) \):
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

Therefore, the final estimate is: 
{probability: 0.4138}
