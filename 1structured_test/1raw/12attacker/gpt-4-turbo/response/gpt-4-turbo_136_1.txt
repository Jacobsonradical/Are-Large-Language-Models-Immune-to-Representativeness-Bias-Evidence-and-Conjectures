To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which will help us update the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony. Let's break down the needed probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability (P(M)):** Probability that a randomly chosen person (and hence the attacker) is male. From the given information, this is 15% or 0.15.

2. **Probability a Person is Female (P(F)):** From the given information, 85% or 0.85.

3. **Probability the Witness Correctly Identifies a Male as Male (P(W|M)):** From the information, we know the witness is accurate 80% of the time, so this probability is 0.8.

4. **Probability the Witness Incorrectly Identifies a Female as Male (P(W|F)):** The witness makes an error in 20% of identifications, so there's a 20% chance they would identify a female as male, which is 0.2.

We are looking for the probability that the attacker is male given the witness said the attacker is male, denoted as P(M|W).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we apply this to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the demographic distribution of gender in the city:

{probability: 0.4138}
