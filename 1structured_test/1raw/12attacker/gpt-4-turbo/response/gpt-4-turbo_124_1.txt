To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population gender ratios, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \(M\) as the event that the attacker is male,
- \(F\) as the event that the attacker is female,
- \(W_M\) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We know the following:
- \(P(W_M | M)\) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are male) is 80%, or 0.8,
- \(P(W_M | F)\) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are female) is 20%, or 0.2, since the witness error rate is 20%,
- \(P(M)\) (prior probability the attacker is male), from the cityâ€™s population, is 15%, or 0.15,
- \(P(F)\) (prior probability the attacker is female) is 85%, or 0.85.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]
where \(P(W_M)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, calculated through the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \times P(M) + P(W_M | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is approximately 0.414.
