To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can employ Bayes' theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, and it is applied here since we're updating our belief about the attacker's gender based on the new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- M as the event "the attacker is male"
- F as the event "the attacker is female"
- W_M as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as male"

From the given data:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
   - P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

2. The reliability of the witness:
   - P(W_M | M) = 0.80 (If the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies as male 80% of the time)
   - P(W_M | F) = 0.20 (If the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M | W_M), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

Where P(W_M) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \times P(M) + P(W_M | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using these values in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Final answer:
{probability: 0.414}
