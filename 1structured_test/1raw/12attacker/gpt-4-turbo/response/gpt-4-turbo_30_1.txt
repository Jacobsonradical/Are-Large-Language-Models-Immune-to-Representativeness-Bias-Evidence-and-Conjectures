To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the available information, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is written as:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given that a witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability the attacker is male (the prior probability based on population).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Step-by-step calculation:
1. **Prior Probabilities**:
    - From the information provided, \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
    - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

2. **Witness Accuracy**:
    - \( P(W | M) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, which is 0.8.
    - \( P(W | F) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male, which is 0.2.

3. **Total Probability of Witness Identifying as Male** (\( P(W) \)):
    - Based on the law of total probability:
      \[
      P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) 
      \]
      \[
      P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
      \]

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
    - Calculate \( P(M | W) \):
      \[
      P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
      \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness' identification, is approximately 0.4138.
