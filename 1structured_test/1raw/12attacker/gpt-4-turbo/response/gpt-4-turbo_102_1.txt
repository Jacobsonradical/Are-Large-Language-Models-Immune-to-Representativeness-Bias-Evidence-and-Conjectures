To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using the law of total probability, \( P(W) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Plugging into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.
