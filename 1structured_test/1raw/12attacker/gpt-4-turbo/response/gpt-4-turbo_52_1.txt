To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's claim and the population distribution in the city, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:

- **\(M\)** = The event that the attacker is male.
- **\(W\)** = The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to compute \(P(M | W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayesâ€™ theorem states:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
Where:
- \(P(W | M)\) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \(P(M)\) is the prior probability of the attacker being male.
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

From the problem statement:
- \(P(W | M) = 0.80\) (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \(P(M) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is male).

We also need \(P(W | F)\), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female:
- \(P(W | F) = 0.20\) (The witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time).

\(P(F)\) is the probability that the attacker is female:
- \(P(F) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is female).

Now, using the law of total probability, \(P(W)\) can be calculated as:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.
