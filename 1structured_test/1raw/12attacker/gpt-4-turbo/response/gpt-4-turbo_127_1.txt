To solve this, we apply Bayesian probability. We need to compute \(P(M | W)\), where:
- \(M\) = event that the attacker is male.
- \(W\) = witness testified that the attacker is male.

From the given data:
- \(P(W | M) = 0.8\) (probability that witness correctly identifies a male).
- \(P(W | F) = 0.2\) (probability that witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- \(P(M) = 0.15\) (prior probability of a male attacker).
- \(P(F) = 0.85\) (prior probability of a female attacker).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where
\[ 
P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) .
\]
Thus,
\[ 
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 .
\]
Now, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 .
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
