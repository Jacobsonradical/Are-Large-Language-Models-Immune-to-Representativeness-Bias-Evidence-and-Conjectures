To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the available information, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context states:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. From the information, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that any given person (and so the attacker) is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W | F) \) is the probability that the witness wrongly identifies the attacker as male even though they are female. From the information, this is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(F) \) is the probability that any given person (and so the attacker) is female, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
