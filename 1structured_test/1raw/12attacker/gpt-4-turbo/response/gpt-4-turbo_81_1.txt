To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- M = attacker is male
- F = attacker is female
- W = witness identifies the attacker as male

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Given:
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness identifies male given the attacker is male)
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness identifies male given the attacker is female)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is female)

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the true gender:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \times P(M) + P(W \mid F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.41.
