To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given these information pieces, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that any given person (hence, the attacker) is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From information "a", the witness identifies the correct gender 80% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (probability witness identifies male correctly)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, i.e., error rate)

From information "b", 15% of the population is male and 85% is female:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (probability the attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is female)

We also need \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
