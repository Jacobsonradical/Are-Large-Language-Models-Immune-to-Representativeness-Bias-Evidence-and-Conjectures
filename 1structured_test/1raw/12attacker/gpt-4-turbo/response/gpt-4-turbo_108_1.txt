To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be stated as:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

Where:

- \( P(\text{Male}) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is male. From the data, this is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male} \mid \text{Male}) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male. From the data, we know the witness is correct 80% of the time, regardless of gender. Thus, this is 0.80.
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \) is the total probability that the witness says the person is male. This is calculated using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male} \mid \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]
  Here, \( P(\text{Female}) \) is 85% or 0.85, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 20%, or 0.20. Therefore,
  \[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem gives:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.
