To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event "the attacker is male",
- \( F \) as the event "the attacker is female",
- \( W \) as the event "witness identifies the attacker as male".

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(M) \), the probability that the attacker is male, is 15% (0.15), given by the city's population statistics (15% male).
   - \( P(F) \), the probability that the attacker is female, is 85% (0.85).

2. **Likelihoods (based on the witness's ability)**:
   - \( P(W|M) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 80% (0.80).
   - \( P(W|F) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, is 20% (0.20), which is the probability of the witness making an error in identifying gender.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male and considering the witness's accuracy as well as the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

So, in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
