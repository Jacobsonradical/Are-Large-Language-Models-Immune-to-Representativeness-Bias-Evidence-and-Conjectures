To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayesian statistics. The formula for this is as follows:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness saw Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness saw Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness saw Male})} \]

From the given data:
- \( P(\text{Witness saw Male} \mid \text{Male}) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identified as male when the attacker is actually male)
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(\text{Witness saw Female} \mid \text{Male}) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identified as female when the attacker is actually male)

We need to calculate \( P(\text{Witness saw Male}) \), which is the total probability of the witness reporting that they saw a male. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Witness saw Male}) = P(\text{Witness saw Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness saw Male} \mid \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]

From the information:
- \( P(\text{Witness saw Male} \mid \text{Female}) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies female as male)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

Plugging the values we get:
\[ P(\text{Witness saw Male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness saw Male}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that a witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414 (rounded to three decimal places).
