To compute the probability that the attacker is male given the information we have, we use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is stated as follows:

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness says the attacker is male.
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is male. From the text, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(\text{Male}) \) is the probability that any individual is male, which is 15% or 0.15 as per the given population statistics.
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \) is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male, which can be computed using the law of total probability: \(P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female})\)
  - \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, also 20% or 0.2.
  - \( P(\text{Female}) \) is the probability that any individual is female, 85% or 0.85.

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \):
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is about 0.4138.
