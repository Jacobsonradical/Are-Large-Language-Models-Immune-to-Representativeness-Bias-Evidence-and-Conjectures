To find the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We know the following:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (true positive rate) is 80%, so P(W | M) = 0.80.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (false positive rate) is 20%, so P(W | F) = 0.20, where F is the event that the attacker is female.
- The prior probability of the attacker being male, P(M), is 15% or 0.15 because 15% of the population is male.
- Similarly, the prior probability of the attacker being female, P(F), is 85% or 0.85 because 85% of the population is female.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(M | W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
Here, \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Putting these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually male is about 0.4138.

In the required format:
