To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of the attacker being male based on the new information provided by the witness.

Let:
- \(M\) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \(F\) be the event that the attacker is female.
- \(W\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

According to the problem:
- The prior probabilities based on population (ignoring the witness testimony) are:
  - \(P(M) = 0.15\) (15%)
  - \(P(F) = 0.85\) (85%)

- The witness has a 80% accuracy in identifying gender correctly. Thus:
  - \(P(W | M) = 0.80\) (Probability witness identifies male given attacker is male)
  - \(P(W | F) = 0.20\) (Probability witness identifies male given attacker is female â€“ error)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as such, \(P(M | W)\), is given by:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where:
\[
P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F)
\]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Then:
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately:
\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
