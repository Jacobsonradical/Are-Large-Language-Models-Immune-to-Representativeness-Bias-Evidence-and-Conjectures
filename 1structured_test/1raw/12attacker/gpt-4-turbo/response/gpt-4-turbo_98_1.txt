To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information from the witness and the gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( M \) = event that the attacker is male
- \( \neg M \) = event that the attacker is not male (i.e., female)
- \( W \) = event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

From the problem, we know:
- Prior probability that a randomly chosen person is male, \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- Prior probability that a randomly chosen person is female, \( P(\neg M) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as male given they are male, \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (witness is correct 80% of the time)
- Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as male given they are not male (female), \( P(W | \neg M) = 0.2 \) (witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

We want to find:
- \( P(M | W) \), the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | \neg M) P(\neg M) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, plug this and the other values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

So in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
