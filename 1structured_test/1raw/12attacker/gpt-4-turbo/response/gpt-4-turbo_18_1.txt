To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( M \) = Attacker is male
- \( F \) = Attacker is female (Though not needed explicitly here since \( M \) and \( F \) are complements)
- \( W \) = Witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find \( P(M|W) \) (the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male).

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \)  (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \)  (85% of the population is female)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \)  (Probability that witness identifies the person as male given that the person is male)
   - \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \)  (Probability that witness identifies the person as male given that the person is female)

We use Bayes' Theorem as follows:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[
P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
