To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Based on the initial information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies male as male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male regardless of the actual gender, we use:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging in the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
