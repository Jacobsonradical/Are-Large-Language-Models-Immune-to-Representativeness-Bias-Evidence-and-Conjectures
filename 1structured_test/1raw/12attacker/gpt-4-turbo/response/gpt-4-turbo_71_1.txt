To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, where we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the testimony of the witness. Let's define:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male,
- \( W \) as the event where the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability of the attacker being male, is 15% (or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg M) \), the probability of the attacker being female, is 85% (or 0.85).

The witness can correctly identify gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W | M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(W | \neg M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, is 20% (or 0.2).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | \neg M) P(\neg M)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85}
\]
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
\]
\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M | W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.
