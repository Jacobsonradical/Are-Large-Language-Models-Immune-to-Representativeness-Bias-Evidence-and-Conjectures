To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

The key probabilities we know are:
- \( P(M) \): the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(\neg M) \): the probability that the attacker is not male (i.e., female), is 0.85.
- \( P(W | M) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8.
- \( P(W | \neg M) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.2.

We want to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can compute this using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | \neg M) \times P(\neg M) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
