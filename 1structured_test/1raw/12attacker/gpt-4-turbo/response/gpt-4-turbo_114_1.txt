To determine the probability that the attacker is male given these specific circumstances, we can use Bayesian reasoning, where we apply Bayes' theorem. Let's designate the following:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (witness falsely identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) P(M) + P(W | F) P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Then substituting back into Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, based on the given data and calculations, the probability estimate that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male and considering the witness's accuracy, is approximately 0.4138.
