To solve this problem and find the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, let's apply Bayes' theorem. We denote M as the attacker being male, and W as the witness identifying the attacker as male.

1. **Calculate P(M), the prior probability that the attacker is male:**
   Given, 15% of the population is male.
   \( P(M) = 0.15 \)

2. **Calculate P(W | M), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male:**
   The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
   \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \)

3. **Calculate P(W | F), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female:**
   The witness erred in 20% of the cases (misidentifying female as male).
   \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \)

4. **Calculate P(F), the prior probability that the attacker is female:**
   Given, 85% of the population is female.
   \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

5. **Calculate P(W), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:**
   This can be computed using the law of total probability.
   \[ P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

6. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find P(M | W), the probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male:**
   \[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
   \[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
