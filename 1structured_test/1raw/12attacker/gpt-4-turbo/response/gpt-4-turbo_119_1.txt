To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is defined as:

\[ \text{P(Male|Witness says Male)} = \frac{\text{P(Witness says Male|Male) × P(Male)}}{\text{P(Witness says Male)}} \]

Where:
- \(\text{P(Male|Witness says Male)}\) is the probability the attacker is male given that the witness says the attacker is male.
- \(\text{P(Witness says Male|Male)}\) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is male when the attacker is actually male. According to the information, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \(\text{P(Male)}\) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% of the population, so this is 0.15.
- \(\text{P(Witness says Male)}\) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is male. This includes both cases when the attacker is actually male and when the attacker is actually female but the witness mistakenly identifies them as male. This is calculated as:
  \[ \text{P(Witness says Male)} = \text{P(Witness says Male|Male) × P(Male)} + \text{P(Witness says Male|Female) × P(Female)} \]

Given:
- \(\text{P(Witness says Male|Female)}\) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is male when the attacker is actually female. According to the information, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, so this probability is 0.2.
- \(\text{P(Female)}\) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% of the population, so this is 0.85.

Then:
\[ \text{P(Witness says Male)} = (0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, substituting everything back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ \text{P(Male|Witness says Male)} = \frac{0.8 × 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.
