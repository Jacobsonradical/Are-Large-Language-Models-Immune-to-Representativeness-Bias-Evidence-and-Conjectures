To solve this problem, we should use Bayesian statistics to update our beliefs about the probability that the attacker is male based on the evidence provided by the witness. 

Step 1: Establish the prior probabilities.
- P(M) = Probability the attacker is male = 15% = 0.15
- P(F) = Probability the attacker is female = 85% = 0.85

Step 2: Establish the likelihoods using witness reliability.
The witness, who can correctly identify gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time:
- P(Witness says 'Male' | Attacker is male) = 0.8
- P(Witness says 'Male' | Attacker is female) = 0.2

Step 3: Use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness said the attacker is male.
\[ P(M | \text{"Witness says 'Male'"}) = \frac{P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"} | M) \times P(M)}{P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"})} \]
Where:
\[ P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"}) = P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"} | M) \times P(M) + P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"} | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(\text{"Witness says 'Male'"}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(M | \text{"Witness says 'Male'"}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

The estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
