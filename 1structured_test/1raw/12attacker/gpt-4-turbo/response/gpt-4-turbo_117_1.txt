To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person (and thus the attacker) is male based on the population).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person is female).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where 
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F)
\]
Substituting in the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately:
\[
\{ "probability": 0.41379 \}
\]
