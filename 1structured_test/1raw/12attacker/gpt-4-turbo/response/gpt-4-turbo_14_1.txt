To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem which helps in updating our prior belief based on new evidence. Our pieces of information include:

1. The prior probabilities based on population statistics:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is female)

2. The conditional probability of the witness testifying the person is male given their actual gender (\( P(T_M | G) \)):
   - \( P(T_M | M) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
   - \( P(T_M | F) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | T_M) = \frac{P(T_M | M) \times P(M)}{P(T_M)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(T_M) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[ P(T_M) = P(T_M | M) \times P(M) + P(T_M | F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(T_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(T_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | T_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | T_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the answer in the required format:
{
  "probability": 0.41
