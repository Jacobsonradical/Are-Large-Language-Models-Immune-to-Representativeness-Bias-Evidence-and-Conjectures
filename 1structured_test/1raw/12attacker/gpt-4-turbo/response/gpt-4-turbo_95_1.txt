To find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which consists of both correct and incorrect identifications.

Given:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness's accuracy when the person is actually male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness's error rate when the person is actually female)

The prior probability that the attacker is female \( P(F) \) is 85% or 0.85.

Now compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4137931 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414.
