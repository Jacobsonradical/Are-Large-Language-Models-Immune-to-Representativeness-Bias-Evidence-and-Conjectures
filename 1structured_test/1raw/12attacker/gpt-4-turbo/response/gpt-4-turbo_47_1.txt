To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability (P(Male))**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen person is male based on the population. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is male. Thus, P(Male) = 0.15.

2. **Prior Probability (P(Female))**: Conversely, the probability that a person is female is 85%. Thus, P(Female) = 0.85.

3. **Likelihood of Evidence (P(Witness says Male | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is actually male. From the information given, the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. Thus, P(Witness says Male | Male) = 0.80.

4. **Likelihood of Evidence (P(Witness says Male | Female))**: This is the probability that the witness says the attacker is male when the attacker is actually female. The witness makes a mistake 20% of the time in gender identification. Therefore, P(Witness says Male | Female) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the person as male:

\[
P(Male | Witness\ says\ Male) = \frac{P(Witness\ says\ Male | Male) \times P(Male)}{P(Witness\ says\ Male)}
\]

Let's calculate \(P(Witness\ says\ Male)\) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Witness\ says\ Male) = P(Witness\ says\ Male | Male) \times P(Male) + P(Witness\ says\ Male | Female) \times P(Female)
\]
\[
P(Witness\ says\ Male) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging everything into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(Male | Witness\ says\ Male) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the demographic data, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
