To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the person is male given the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as male given they are male.
- \( P(M) \) is the probability that a random person is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that a person is identified as male.

First, letâ€™s define our variables using the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness identifies a person as male correctly 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a person as male 20% of the time when they are female).

Next, calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(M|W) \):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness' identification, is approximately 0.4138.
