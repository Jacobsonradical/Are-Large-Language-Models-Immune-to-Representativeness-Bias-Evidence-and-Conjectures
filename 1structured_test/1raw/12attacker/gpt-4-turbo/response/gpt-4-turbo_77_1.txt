To determine the likelihood that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

The probability \( P(M) \) that the attacker is male is given by the population distribution:
\[ P(M) = 0.15. \]
The probability \( P(\neg M) \) that the attacker is not male (i.e., female) is:
\[ P(\neg M) = 0.85. \]

We also know the witness's accuracy:
- The probability \( P(W \mid M) \), that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.80.
- The probability \( P(W \mid \neg M) \), that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.20.

To find \( P(M \mid W) \) (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male), we use Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}, \]
where:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \times P(M) + P(W \mid \neg M) \times P(\neg M). \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29. \]

Now, using these values in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) ≈ 0.4138. \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately:
