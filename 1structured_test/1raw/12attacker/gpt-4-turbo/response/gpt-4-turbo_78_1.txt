To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies the gender as male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (The witness mistakenly identifies the gender as male 20% of the time when the attacker is actually female)

Now we calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.4138. Providing the result in the requested format:
