To answer the question, we use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's define the following:

- Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the problem statement, we have that:
- The prior probability \( P(M) \) that the attacker is male is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- The probability \( P(W \mid M) \), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 80% or 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).
- The probability \( P(W \mid M^c) \), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (mistakenly identifies gender), is 20% or 0.2 (this also comes from the witness's error rate).

We also need:
- \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male (whether the attacker is actually male or not). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  \[
  P(W) = P(W \mid M)P(M) + P(W \mid M^c)P(M^c)
  \]
  where \( P(M^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is not male (i.e., is female), which is 85% or 0.85.
  \[
  P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
  \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M)P(M)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that a witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.414.
