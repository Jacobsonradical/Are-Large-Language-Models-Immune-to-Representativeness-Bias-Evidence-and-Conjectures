To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context says the probability that the attacker was male, given the witness said so, is:

\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness said Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness said Male})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness said Male}) \) is the probability the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Male}) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(\text{Male}) \) is the prior probability that any given person (or attacker) is male.
- \( P(\text{Witness said Male}) \) is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male.

From the given information:
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

The witness:
- Correctly identifies gender 80% of the time (whether male or female).
   - So, \( P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Male}) = 0.80 \)
   - And \( P(\text{Witness said Female} \mid \text{Female}) = 0.80 \)
- Errs 20% of the time.
   - So, \( P(\text{Witness said Female} \mid \text{Male}) = 0.20 \)
   - And \( P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Female}) = 0.20 \)

\[ P(\text{Witness said Male}) = P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness said Male} \mid \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness said Male}) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified him as male is:
\[ P(\text{Male} \mid \text{Witness said Male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.41.
