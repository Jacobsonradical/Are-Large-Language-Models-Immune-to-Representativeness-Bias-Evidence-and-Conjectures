To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender ratio in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness wrongly identifies the female as male 20% of the time).
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).

We first calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = 0.4138 \]

Approximately, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is about 0.41.
