To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context helps us update our probability estimation for the gender of the attacker based on the witness's testimony:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (before considering the witness's identification), based on the population gender distribution.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as male.

Given:
- The witness identifies correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Thus, \( P(W|M) \) (true positive rate) = 0.80, \( P(W|F) \) (false positive rate; i.e., incorrectly identifies as male when the attacker is female) = 0.20.
- \( P(M) \) = 15% (0.15) of the population is male.
- \( P(F) \) = 85% (0.85) of the population is female.

Now calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute these values back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
