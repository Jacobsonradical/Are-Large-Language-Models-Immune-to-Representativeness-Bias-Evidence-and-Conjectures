To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \times P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are actually male, which is 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability the attacker is male, provided as 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To find \( P(W) \), apply the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \times P(M) + P(W|F) \times P(F) \]
where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are female, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
- \( P(F) \) is the probability the attacker is female, provided as 0.85 (85% of the population is female).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.4138.
