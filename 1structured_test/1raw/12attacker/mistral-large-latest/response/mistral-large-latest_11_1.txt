To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is male).
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is female):

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
