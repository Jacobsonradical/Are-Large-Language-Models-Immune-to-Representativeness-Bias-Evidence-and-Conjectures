To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is female):

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\text{{probability: 0.4138}}
