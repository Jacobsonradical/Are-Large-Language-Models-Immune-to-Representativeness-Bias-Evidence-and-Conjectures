To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is male.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as male given that the person is male.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as male given that the person is female.
- \( P(M|W) \) as the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information:

1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
3. \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
4. \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
