To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \) as the probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) as the probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.

From the information given:

1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
3. \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, is given by:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{\text{{probability: 0.4138}}}
\]
