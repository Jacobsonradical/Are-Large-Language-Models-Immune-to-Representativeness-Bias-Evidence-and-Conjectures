To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
2. \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).
3. \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \):

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
