To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is male).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is female).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
