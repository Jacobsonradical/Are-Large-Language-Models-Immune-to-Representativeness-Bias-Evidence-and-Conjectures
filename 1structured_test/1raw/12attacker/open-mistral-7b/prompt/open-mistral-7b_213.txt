A person was attacked from behind at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's gender. Despite this, we have the following two pieces of information:

{
  "a": "85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.",
  "b": "A witness identified the attacker as male. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases."
}

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker is male?

First, feel free to reason and compute. And then please answer the question strictly in the following dictionary format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
