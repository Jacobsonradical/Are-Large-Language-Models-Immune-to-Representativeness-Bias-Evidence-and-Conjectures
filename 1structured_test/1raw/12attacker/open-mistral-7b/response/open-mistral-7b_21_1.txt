Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker being male. We have two pieces of evidence:
1. The population distribution of males and females in the city (85% female, 15% male).
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male, is P(M|witness says male) = 0.8 (from information b).

Similarly, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, is P(F|witness says male) = 0.2 (from information b).

The probability of the witness saying that the attacker is male, given the population distribution, is P(witness says male) = P(M) * P(witness says male|M) + P(F) * P(witness says male|F) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(M|witness says male) = [P(witness says male)|M] * P(M) / P(witness says male)

Calculating the right side of the equation, we get:

P(M|witness says male) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18 ≈ 0.667

So, based on the given information, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
