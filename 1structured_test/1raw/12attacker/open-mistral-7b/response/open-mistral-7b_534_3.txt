Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the prior probability, which is the probability of an attacker being male in the city, given the city's gender distribution:

P(Male) = 15% = 0.15

Next, we have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. Let's call this probability P(Male | Witness's gender guess is Male). Since the witness correctly identifies male genders 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Similarly, let's call P(Female | Witness's gender guess is Male) the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male when making a gender guess. This probability is 1 - P(Male | Witness's gender guess is Male) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. Given this information, the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's gender guess is:

P(Female | Witness's gender guess is Male) = 1 - P(Male | Witness's gender guess is Male) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's gender guess:

P(Male | Witness's gender guess is Male) = P(Witness's gender guess is Male | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's gender guess is Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's gender guess is Male | Female) * P(Female)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(Male | Witness's gender guess is Male) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
