Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker is male:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.
2. Since the population is 85% female, the probability that the witness sees a female is 0.85.
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).
4. Since the attacker is not a female, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).
5. However, we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, so we cannot directly use this probability.
6. Instead, we should consider the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is actually male.
7. Since the population is 15% male, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
8. Given that the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies the gender 83% of the time.
9. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.83.
10. The witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 17% of the time.
11. However, given that the attacker is actually male, this event does not occur.
12. Therefore, the probability of this event is 0.
13. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.83.

Answer: {probability: 0.83}
