Given the two pieces of information provided, we have a population that is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, in similar conditions, was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male, we can consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M). Then, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male can be calculated as 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (error rate for females). Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (error rate for males).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the sum of two cases:
1) The witness correctly identifies a male. P(M) = 0.15
2) The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. P(M) = 0.17 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.025

Adding these two probabilities gives us:
P(M) = 0.15 + 0.025 = 0.175

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.175 or 17.5%. This estimate accounts for the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the population.
