Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and makes errors 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's gender identification).

Here's a step-by-step calculation:

1. Define our hypotheses: H1 (attacker is male) and H2 (attacker is female).
2. Calculate the prior probabilities: P(H1) = 0.15 (15% male population) and P(H2) = 0.85 (85% female population).
3. Calculate the likelihood of the witness's gender identification given each hypothesis: P(witness identifies male | H1) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy) and P(witness identifies male | H2) = 0.2 (witness's error rate).
4. Calculate the posterior probability: P(H1 | witness identifies male) = [P(witness identifies male | H1) * P(H1)] / [P(witness identifies male | H1) * P(H1) + P(witness identifies male | H2) * P(H2)].

Plugging in the values:

P(H1 | witness identifies male) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male as:
