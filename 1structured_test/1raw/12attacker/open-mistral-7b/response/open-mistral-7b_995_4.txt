To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male (0.8)
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male (1 - p = 0.2)
- f as the proportion of females in the city (0.85)
- m as the proportion of males in the city (1 - f = 0.15)

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we can write the following equation:

p * P(M) + q * P(F) = 1

We also know the proportion of males in the city, so we can write another equation:

P(M) = m

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve them to find the probability of the attacker being male:

p * P(M) + q * P(F) = 1
P(M) = m

Substituting P(M) into the first equation:

p * m + q * (1 - m) = 1

Now, we can solve for m:

0.8m + 0.2(1 - m) = 1
0.8m + 0.2 - 0.2m = 1
0.6m = 0.8
m = 0.8 / 0.6
m = 1.33 (This is not a valid probability, so we can round down to 1 as the attacker cannot be more likely to be male than the actual proportion in the city)

However, considering the witness's error rate, it's unlikely that the witness would mistakenly identify a majority of the attackers as male when the actual proportion is 15%. Therefore, we can use the witness's accuracy rate as an estimate:

P(M) = m = 0.15

The probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, or 15%.
