To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the actual proportion of males in the city and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

From the first piece of information, we know that 15% of the population is male. However, the witness's reliability in identifying gender suggests that the witness might not always correctly identify the gender of a person. In 20% of the cases, the witness errs in identifying the gender.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. This happens with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
2. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender. This happens with a probability of 0.2 (20%).

However, we don't have enough information to know the actual probability of each scenario. The witness's reliability in gender identification only tells us the probability of being correct in a random case, but we don't know if the attacker is a random case or not.

Therefore, based on the given information, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate for the attacker being male. We would need more information to make a more accurate estimate.
