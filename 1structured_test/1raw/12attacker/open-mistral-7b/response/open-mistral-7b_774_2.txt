To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender, it means that the attacker was misidentified as female in 20% of the cases (since the witness erred 20% of the time). However, the witness identified the attacker as male, so the attacker must have been misidentified as male in less than 20% of the cases where the actual attacker was female.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). We know that the probability that the attacker is female is P(female) = 1 - P(male).

The witness incorrectly identified a female as male in 20% of the cases. So, the probability that a female is misidentified as male is P(male|female) = 0.2.

Since the witness correctly identified a male in 80% of the cases, the probability that a male is correctly identified as male is P(male|male) = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is:

P(male) = P(male and correctly identified) / P(correctly identified)

P(male and correctly identified) = P(male) * P(male|male)
P(correctly identified) = P(male) * P(male|male) + P(female) * P(male|female)

We know that P(female) = 0.85 and P(male) = 1 - P(female) = 0.15. We also know that P(male|male) = 0.8 and P(male|female) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(male) = (P(male) * P(male|male)) / ((P(male) * P(male|male)) + (P(female) * P(male|female)))

P(male) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.16 or 16%. This estimate takes into account the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.
