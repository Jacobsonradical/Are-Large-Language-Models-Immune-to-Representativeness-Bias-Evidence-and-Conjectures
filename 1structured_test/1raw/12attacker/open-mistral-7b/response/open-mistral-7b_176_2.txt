Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

1. The witness identified the attacker as male with a certain level of confidence (80% correct, 20% incorrect). However, the gender distribution in the city is not equal (85% female, 15% male). This could potentially affect the witness's ability to correctly identify the attacker's gender.

2. To make an estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

3. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is male, P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, and P(B|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

4. Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)].

5. We know P(A) = 0.15 (15% male in the city), P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% correct by the witness), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (20% incorrect by the witness).

6. To find P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% female in the city).

7. Now, we can calculate P(A|B): [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 or 12%.
