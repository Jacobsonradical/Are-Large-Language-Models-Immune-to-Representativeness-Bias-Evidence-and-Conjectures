To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory that describes the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male
- B as the event that the population is predominantly female (85% female and 15% male)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability P(A|E) can be calculated as:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E)]

We are given:
- P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is 0.8 (from the information provided)
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (from the information provided)
- P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male and incorrectly identifying a female: P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)

Since P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker, and P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

- P(E|not A) = 0.2 (from the information provided)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is female)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
