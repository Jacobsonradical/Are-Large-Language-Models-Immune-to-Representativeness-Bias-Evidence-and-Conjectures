To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the information given and make an adjustment for the witness's error rate.

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male must be lower than 15%. However, we need to account for the witness's error rate in this assessment.

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a female attacker and using that as a correction factor for the 15% probability of a male attacker.

The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is the error rate, which is 20%.

Given that the population is 85% female, the probability of selecting a female for the witness to observe is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness made an error, the actual probability of a male attacker must be lower than 15% - 17% = -2%. However, since probabilities cannot be negative, we can interpret this as an indication that the witness's error rate is too high and that our initial assumption of a 15% probability of a male attacker might be too high.

In summary, based on the given information, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate for the attacker being male. However, given the witness's error rate, it seems unlikely that the attacker was male.
