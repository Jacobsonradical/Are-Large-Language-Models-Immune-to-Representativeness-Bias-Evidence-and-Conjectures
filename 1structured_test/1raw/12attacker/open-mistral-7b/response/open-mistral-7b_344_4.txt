To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that there is a 80% chance that the witness was correct in this instance and a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect. However, if the witness was incorrect, it means the attacker is actually female, which contradicts the city's population distribution (where only 15% of the population is male).

Given that the witness's error would imply a contradiction with the known population distribution, it is reasonable to assume that the witness was more likely correct in this instance than their usual 80% error rate. In other words, the probability that the attacker is male is likely higher than 80%.

However, without more specific information about the witness's error rate in situations where they should have identified a female attacker, it is not possible to provide a precise probability. Therefore, I cannot strictly answer the question in the provided dictionary format.
