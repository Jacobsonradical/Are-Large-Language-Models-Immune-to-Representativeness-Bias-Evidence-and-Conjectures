Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the event is "the attacker is male," and we have two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is determined by the gender distribution in the city (85% female and 15% male).
2. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. This probability is given as 0.8 by the witness's ability to judge gender.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is male," and B is the event "the witness identifies the attacker as male."

So, the probability P(A|B) that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male), and P(B) = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1-P(A)) (the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, regardless of their gender), we can calculate P(A|B).

The calculation would look something like this:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.85 * 0.15 + 0.15 * (1-0.15)]

After calculating, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.28, or 28%.
