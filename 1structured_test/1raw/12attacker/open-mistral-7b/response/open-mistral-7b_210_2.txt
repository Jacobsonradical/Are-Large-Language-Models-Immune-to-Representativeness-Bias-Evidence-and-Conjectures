To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can assume that in a fair scenario, the attacker's gender is correctly identified 0.8 times out of every 1 attempt. However, due to the witness's error rate, they might mistakenly identify a female as male 0.2 times out of every 1 attempt.

Since there is an 85% chance of the attacker being female (from information b), there is a corresponding 15% chance of the attacker being male. Let's call the probability of the attacker being male "p."

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (proportion of correct gender identifications).
The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of attacker being female * error rate in identifying males).

So, the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of attacker being female * error rate in identifying males).

The total probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male is the sum of the two probabilities above.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.68}

The attacker has approximately a 68% probability of being male based on the given information.
