To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the victim, we'll assume an equal probability of the attacker being male or female.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). Then, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 1 - P(male).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening if the attacker is actually male is P(male). The probability of this event happening if the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies him as male is (1 - P(male)).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation:

P(male) + (1 - P(male)) * (1 / 2) = 0.8 (given the witness's accuracy)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(male) = 0.8 - 0.4 * (1 - P(male))

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = 0.64

However, the gender distribution in the population is 85% female and 15% male. Since the witness might be biased towards identifying people as female (due to the city's gender ratio), their accuracy might not be representative of the actual gender distribution.

The witness's accuracy rate of 80% is higher than the expected gender ratio of 15% male, which suggests a bias towards identifying people as female. This bias could potentially overestimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Taking this into account, it's difficult to provide a definitive probability estimate without more information. However, given the witness's accuracy and the city's gender ratio, it seems plausible that the attacker is female.

{probability: approximately 0.64, but with a caveat about the witness's potential bias and the city's gender ratio}
