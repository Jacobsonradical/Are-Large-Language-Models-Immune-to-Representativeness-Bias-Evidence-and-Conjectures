To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F). According to the given information, P(M) + P(F) = 1.

The probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is indeed male, is the witness's accuracy in identifying gender, which we know is 0.8. Let's denote this as P(M|witnessM). Similarly, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is female, is the witness's error rate, which we know is 0.2. Let's denote this as P(M|witnessF).

Similarly, we have P(F|witnessM) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, given that the attacker is indeed female) and P(F|witnessF) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a female as female, given that the attacker is indeed female).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M):

P(M) = P(M|witnessM) * P(witnessM) / [P(M|witnessM) * P(witnessM) + P(M|witnessF) * P(witnessF)]

We are given that P(M|witnessM) = 0.8 and P(M|witnessF) = 0.2. We also know that the population is 85% female and 15% male, which means P(witnessF) = 0.85 and P(witnessM) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4137931034482759

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
