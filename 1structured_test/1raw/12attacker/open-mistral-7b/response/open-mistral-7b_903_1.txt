To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification, especially under poor lighting conditions.

1. City's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we should note that the witness's error rate does not account for situations where the witness is mistaken about the city's gender distribution. Since the witness is in a city with an 85% female population, it is more likely that they will misidentify a male as female than vice versa, given their error rate.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We want to find an estimate for this probability.

Given the city's gender distribution, we can calculate the probability of the witness seeing a male: P(male) = 0.15.

However, due to the witness's error rate, we need to adjust this probability. Since the witness incorrectly identifies males as females 20% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a male: P(male|identified_as_male) = 0.80.

To estimate the actual probability of the attacker being male (P(male)), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(male) = P(male|identified_as_male) * P(identified_as_male|male) / [P(male|identified_as_male) * P(identified_as_male|male) + P(male|not_identified_as_male) * P(not_identified_as_male|male)]

Our goal is to estimate P(male), so we need to make an assumption about P(not_identified_as_male|male). Given the witness's error rate, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (or not incorrectly identifying a male) is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time, the probability of the witness not incorrectly identifying a male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. Thus, we can assume that P(not_identified_as_male|male) = 0.80.

Now, we can calculate P(male):

P(male) = 0.80 * (0.15 / (0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20)) = 0.15 / 0.20 = 0.75

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.75}. This estimate suggests that, given the city's gender distribution and the witness's error rate, there is a 75% chance that the attacker is male. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not reflect the actual situation due to potential limitations in the data and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender in low-light conditions.
