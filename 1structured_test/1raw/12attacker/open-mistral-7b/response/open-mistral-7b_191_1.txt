To provide an estimate, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the overall gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's gender was not seen directly, there's a chance that the witness could have incorrectly identified the attacker's gender.

Let's denote the true gender of the attacker as M (male) or F (female). The probability the witness identifies M as M is 0.8 (80%), and the probability the witness identifies M as F is 0.2 (20%).

However, we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. So, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

Given these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male (M) given the witness's identification as male:

P(M|witness_identified_as_male) = [P(witness_identified_as_male|M) * P(M)] / [P(witness_identified_as_male|M) * P(M) + P(witness_identified_as_male|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|witness_identified_as_male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the probability:

P(M|witness_identified_as_male) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.04)

Simplifying the fraction:

P(M|witness_identified_as_male) = 0.12 / 0.16

P(M|witness_identified_as_male) = 0.75

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
