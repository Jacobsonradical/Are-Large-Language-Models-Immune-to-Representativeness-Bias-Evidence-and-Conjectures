Given the information provided, the attacker's gender was initially unknown to us. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male with an accuracy rate of 80%. But we also know that in the city, only 15% of the population is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male before knowing the witness's observation)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male)

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, P(B|A):

P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information b)

Next, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is male, P(A):

P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making an observation, B (independent of the attacker's gender):

Since the witness correctly identifies males as males 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B) as the sum of these two probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. Since we don't know this specific probability, we can assume it's the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, which is 0.8.

Now, let's calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from information a)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.34

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.34 â‰ˆ 0.21

So, given the witness's observation, our updated estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 21%.
