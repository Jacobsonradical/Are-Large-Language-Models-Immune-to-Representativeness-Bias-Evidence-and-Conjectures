To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, it means that there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is actually female. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is female is approximately 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

However, since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is male, we need to subtract this probability from 1:

Probability that the attacker is male = 1 - Probability that the attacker is female given a false identification by the witness
                                             = 1 - 0.17
                                             = 0.83 (or 83%)

So, given the population distribution and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 83%.
