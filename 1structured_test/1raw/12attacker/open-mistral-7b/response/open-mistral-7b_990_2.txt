To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. The witness was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, but also made errors 20% of the time. However, the witness's errors were not specified as being more likely to occur with one gender or the other.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male by multiplying the probability of a male attacker (15%) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.8). This gives us a probability of 0.12 or 12%.

However, the witness did identify the attacker as male. Since gender identification is not perfect (the witness was incorrect 20% of the time), it's possible that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a female attacker as male. This is the probability of a female attacker (85%) times the probability of the witness making an error (0.2). This gives us a probability of 0.17 or 17%.

Since we know the attacker is male or female, we can add the probabilities of both scenarios to get the overall probability: 0.12 (probability of correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of error) = 0.29 or 29%.

However, the witness's identification contradicts the actual gender distribution in the city. To account for this, we can adjust our estimate to take into account the reliability of the witness's identification relative to the actual gender distribution. Since the witness was only correct 80% of the time, we might expect their identification to be closer to the actual gender distribution than the 100% it implies.

Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be to use the actual gender distribution as our best guess, and adjust for the witness's error rate. This gives us a probability of 0.15 (probability of a male attacker) times 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.12 or 12%.

In summary, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male ranges from 12% to 29%. However, given the contradiction between the witness's identification and the actual gender distribution, a more conservative estimate would be 12%.
