To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker as male (when the attacker is actually female).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is female as p (since 85% of the population is female, p ≈ 0.85). The probability of the witness erring is then (1 - 0.8) * p + 0.2 * (1 - p), which simplifies to 0.15p + 0.2 * (1 - p) = 0.05 + 0.2p.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the witness erred, and so the actual probability of the attacker being male is 1 - the probability of the witness erring. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - (0.05 + 0.2p).

To find an estimate for p, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male when the attacker is actually male. This probability is 0.8, and since 15% of the population is male, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. So, we have another equation: 0.8 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15), which simplifies to 0.12 = 0.2 - 0.06p.

Solving these two equations for p and p' = 1 - p, we get p ≈ 0.48 and p' ≈ 0.52. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.52 or 52%.
