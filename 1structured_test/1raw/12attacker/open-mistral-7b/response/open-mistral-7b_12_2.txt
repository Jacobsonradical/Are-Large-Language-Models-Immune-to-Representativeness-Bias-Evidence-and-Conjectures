To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness was correct in 80% of their gender identification attempts and incorrect in 20% of the times. However, we don't have enough information about whether the witness's errors were more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males. Therefore, it's not possible to adjust the 80% accuracy rate based on this information.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of a random person being male. This probability is 0.15 (or 15%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening given that the attacker is male is 1 (certainty).

However, if we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we need to consider the probability of the witness making a correct identification. Given that the attacker is male, there's a 0.8 probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male (based on their 80% accuracy rate).

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between misidentifying males as females and females as males. If this is not the case, the actual probability could be different.
