Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence: the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)
- P(~H): prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being female)

From the information provided, we have:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and there is a 0.85 probability of the attacker being female)

We can now calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the evidence using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.26

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.26 or 26%.
