Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, the events are:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to estimate.
Let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given in the first piece of information as 0.8.
Let P(B|~A) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, given that the attacker is not male. This can be estimated as 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
Let P(A|B) be the probability we're interested in, which is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
Let P(B) be the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A).

Given that 85% of the population is female, P(~A) = 0.15.

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.1) / [(0.8) * (0.1) + (0.4) * (0.9)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.158

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 15.8%.
