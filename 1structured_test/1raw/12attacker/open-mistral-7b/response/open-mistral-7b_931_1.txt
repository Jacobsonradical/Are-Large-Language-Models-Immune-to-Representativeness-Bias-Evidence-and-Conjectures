To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male person
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male person (q = 1 - p)
- f as the proportion of females in the city (from information b: f = 0.85)

From information a, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so p = 0.8.

The witness errs 20% of the time, so q = 1 - p = 0.2.

We also know that 85% of the population is female, so the probability of a randomly chosen person being female is f = 0.85.

Given that the witness has made a judgment, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified a male attacker. In this case, the attacker is indeed male, and the probability of this event is p * P(M).
2. The witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. In this case, the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakenly thinks the attacker is male. The probability of this event is q * P(F).

However, we don't have enough information to determine the probability of a female attacker (P(F)). To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the likelihood ratio test.

The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of the observed evidence given that the attacker is male (P(witness's judgment | M)) to the probability of the observed evidence given that the attacker is female (P(witness's judgment | F)).

Given the information, we can write:

P(witness's judgment | M) = p * P(M)
P(witness's judgment | F) = q * P(F)

The ratio of the two probabilities is:

L = (p * P(M)) / (q * P(F))

Since we don't have information about P(F), we can't directly compute L. But we can make an educated guess based on the data given.

The likelihood ratio should reflect the prior probabilities of the attacker being male or female. Since 85% of the population is female, we can infer that the prior probability of a male attacker is low. Thus, we can estimate that L < 1.

However, since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the likelihood ratio should also reflect the witness's ability to correctly identify a male attacker. Since p = 0.8, we can infer that L is significantly greater than 0.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the attacker is female, given the witness's judgment. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can assume that the likelihood ratio L is close to 0.

L = (p * P(M)) / (q * P(F))
0 ≈ (0.8 * P(M)) / (0.2 * 0.85)

Solving for P(M), we get:

P(M) ≈ (0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8
P(M) ≈ 0.175

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 17.5%. This is a rough estimate and should be interpreted with caution, as we have made several assumptions based on limited information.
