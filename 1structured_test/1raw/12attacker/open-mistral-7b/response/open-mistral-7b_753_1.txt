To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

From the population statistics, we know that 15% of the city's population is male. However, the witness's reliability is also important here. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually male and the witness correctly identified the gender.
2. The attacker is female, but the witness incorrectly identified the gender.

Let's calculate the probability for each scenario:

Scenario 1: The attacker is male (P(M)). The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.8.

Scenario 2: The attacker is female (P(F)). The witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is 0.2.

However, there are twice as many females as males in the population (85% vs 15%), so the probability that a random person is female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness dismissed the possibility of a female attacker, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male only if the actual attacker was female. So the probability of this scenario is 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the total probability of both scenarios:

Total probability = P(Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2)
                         = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.17

Since we don't have the exact probability of the attacker being male (P(M)), we can't provide an exact number. However, we can express the total probability as a function of P(M):

Total probability = 0.8P(M) + 0.17

To find the best estimate of P(M), we can set the total probability equal to the witness's reported probability of the attacker being male (which is 100% since the witness identified the attacker as male):

1 = 0.8P(M) + 0.17

Solving for P(M), we get:

P(M) â‰ˆ 0.54 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 54%. However, keep in mind that this estimate is based on the witness's reliability and the given population statistics, and there may be other factors that could affect the actual probability.
