To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (population percentage of males)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (overall accuracy of the witness)

Let's break this down:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
3. P(H|E) is what we want to find
4. P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the overall accuracy of the witness, calculated as the weighted average of the correct identification probability for males and females)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.17 = 0.52941176

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.5294 or 52.94%.
