To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence. The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male),
- E is the evidence (witness's identification),
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which is what we want to find,
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is given in the first piece of information,
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability of the attacker being male before considering any evidence,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is not given directly but can be calculated using the second piece of information.

First, let's calculate P(E|H). According to the first piece of information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time when the person is actually male (80% chance of a true positive), and errs 20% of the time (20% chance of a false positive). So, P(E|H) = 0.8 (true positives) + 0.2 (false positives) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0, but since probabilities should be between 0 and 1, we can adjust this by dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 2 (male and female). So, P(E|H) = 1.0 / 2 = 0.5.

Next, we need to calculate P(H). Given that we don't have any prior information about the attacker's gender, we can assume that the prior probability is equal to the proportion of males in the population, which is given in the second piece of information as 0.15. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(E), the probability of the evidence, which is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of picking a male person at random is 0.15. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a male person, the probability of the witness identifying a male person as male is (1 - 0.2) * 0.15 = 0.12 (true positives) + 0.2 * 0.85 * 0.15 = 0.12 + 0.021 = 0.141.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = (0.5 * 0.15) / 0.141
        = 0.071

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.071 or 7.1%. This is quite low, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This suggests that the witness's ability to judge gender may not be reliable under the specific conditions of the attack.
