Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness made an identification of the attacker as male, we need to account for the possibility that the witness was correct and also the possibility that the witness was incorrect.

If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male. The probability of this happening is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%.

If the witness was incorrect, then the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's identification. In this case, we need to account for the fact that the population is mostly female (85%). The probability of this happening is the witness's error rate multiplied by the proportion of females in the population.

So the probability of the witness being incorrect and the attacker being female is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97 or 97%.

However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the attacker's actual gender, which may not be the case. In real-world situations, people often make gender assumptions based on other factors, which could potentially introduce bias. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation only.
