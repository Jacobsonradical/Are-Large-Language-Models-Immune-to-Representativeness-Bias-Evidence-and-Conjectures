To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

Let's denote:
- p: probability of the attacker being male
- q: probability of the attacker being female (1 - p)

The witness's gender identification accuracy can be represented by two probabilities:
- p_true: probability of correctly identifying a male as male (p)
- p_false: probability of incorrectly identifying a male as female (q * error_rate)

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this actually being true is p_true, and the probability of this being a false positive (the witness's error) is p_false.

The likelihood ratio LR = p_true / p_false.

From the information in "a", we know that the error rate is 0.2 or 20%. So, p_false = q * 0.2.

Since p + q = 1, we can write p_false as p * 0.2.

Now, we are given that p_true = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time).

So, we can set up the following equation:

LR = p / (p * 0.2) = 0.8

Solving for p:

p = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

However, this value is not within the expected probability range (between 0 and 1). This is an indication that the witness's gender identification accuracy does not provide enough information to conclude the attacker's gender with reasonable certainty based on this evidence alone.

Now, let's consider the gender distribution in the city, as given in "b". The attacker could be either male or female, with a population ratio of 15% male and 85% female.

Given this information, it would be more likely for the attacker to be female (85%) than male (15%). But the witness's gender identification error may lead to a misinterpretation of this information.

In conclusion, it's not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate based on the given information. The witness's identification accuracy and the population gender distribution do not provide sufficient evidence to draw a definitive conclusion about the attacker's gender.
