Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have information about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. But since we don't know if the witness's error rate applies to this specific situation or if it's a general error rate, we can't directly use the 80% or 20% numbers.
4. However, we do know that the witness's error rate is higher than the population gender ratio (15% male). This suggests that the witness might have made an error in this case.
5. Without more specific information, it's not possible to calculate an exact probability. But we can make an educated guess. If the witness's error rate is significantly higher than the actual gender distribution, it's more likely that the witness made an error in this case, and the attacker is actually female.

In conclusion, while we can't provide a strict numerical estimate, it seems more likely that the attacker is female, based on the information about the city's population gender distribution and the witness's error rate. But without more specific information, this is just an educated guess.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number, but the attacker being female seems more likely based on the given information.}
