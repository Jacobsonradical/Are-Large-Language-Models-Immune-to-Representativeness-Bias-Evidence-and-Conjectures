Given the information provided, the population of the city is 85% female and 15% male (information "a"). However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time (information "b") identified the attacker as male. This means that even though the attacker's gender might not be actually male with a 15% chance in the general population, the witness's mistake rate makes it possible that the witness misidentified a female attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the error rate of the witness and the overall population distribution. The witness's error rate is 20%, and the population is 85% female and 15% male. If we consider a scenario where the attacker is actually female, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is 20%. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's misidentification would be the error rate, or 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is actually male, there is no room for error, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's correct identification is 100%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can weight these two scenarios by their probabilities (given the error rate and the overall population distribution) and calculate the overall probability that the attacker is male.

Let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, and P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male. We know that P(F) + P(M) = 1, as there are only two possibilities.

Now we set up an equation based on the given information:

P(M) = error rate * P(F) + 100% * P(M) (since there is no error when the attacker is male)

We can simplify this equation to:

P(M) = 0.2 * P(F)

Since P(F) + P(M) = 1, we can express P(F) as:

P(F) = 1 - P(M)

Now we can substitute P(F) in the first equation and solve for P(M):

P(M) = 0.2 * (1 - P(M))

Solving this equation, we find that P(M) â‰ˆ 0.28, or 28%.

In summary, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 28%. This probability is lower than the overall population distribution due to the witness's error rate in gender identification.
