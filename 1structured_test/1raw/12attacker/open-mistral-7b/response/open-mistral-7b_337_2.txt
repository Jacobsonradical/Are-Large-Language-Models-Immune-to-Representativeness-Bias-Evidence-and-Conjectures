To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and there are equal numbers of males and females in the sample, we can assume that the witness's error rate for identifying males is the same as the error rate for identifying females, which is 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the actual number of males in the city. Let's assume the total population is 1000 people. Then there are 1500 * 0.15 = 225 males.

Based on the witness's accuracy, we can expect the witness to mistake a female for a male 225 * 0.2 = 45 times. Since the attacker was mistakenly identified as male, this means the witness must have erred in one of those 45 cases.

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the number of times the witness correctly identified a male as a male, divided by the total number of people the witness identified as male. Since the witness correctly identified males 80% of the time, and out of the 225 males in the city, the witness mistakenly identified 45 as females, the total number of males the witness correctly identified is 225 - 45 = 180.

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is therefore 180 / (225 + 1) = 0.792 or 79.2%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.792} or 79.2%.
