To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male (as per city population statistics), we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as follows:

Probability of witness correctly identifying male attacker = Witness's success rate * Probability that attacker is male
                                                                          = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                                          = 0.12

However, the witness's error rate is also important. If the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's gender, there is a 20% chance that they will mistake a female attacker for a male one. Given the 85% chance that the attacker is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is:

Probability of witness incorrectly identifying female attacker as male = Witness's error rate * Probability that attacker is female
                                                                                             = 0.2 * 0.85
                                                                                             = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we want to find the probability that this identification was correct (the attacker is indeed male) or that it was an error (the attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male). To find this probability, we can add the probability of the correct identification and the probability of the error:

Estimated probability that attacker is male = Probability of witness correctly identifying male attacker + Probability of witness incorrectly identifying female attacker as male
                                                            = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                            = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
