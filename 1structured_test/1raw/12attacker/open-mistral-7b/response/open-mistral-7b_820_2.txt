Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have specific information about how many times they got it right or wrong when identifying the attacker. Since we don't have enough data to directly apply the witness's success rate to this specific case, we can't provide a precise probability.

However, we can make an approximate estimate based on the witness's gender success rate and the city's gender distribution. If we assume that the witness's performance is representative of their gender identification accuracy in this specific situation, and we consider the city's gender distribution, here's how we can approximate the probability:

The city has 85% female population and 15% male population. If the witness was correct in their gender identification, the attacker would indeed be male, and the probability of this event would be the probability of being correct in gender identification multiplied by the proportion of males in the population.

So, the probability would be 0.8 (witness's success rate) * 0.15 (proportion of males in the population) = 0.12, or 12%.

However, if the witness was wrong, they would have mistakenly identified a female as the attacker, which would imply that the attacker is actually female. In this case, the probability of this event would be the probability of error multiplied by the proportion of females in the population.

So, the probability would be 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.85 (proportion of females in the population) = 0.17, or 17%.

Since we don't know if the witness was correct or wrong, we can't directly use the probabilities of these two scenarios. Instead, we can consider these two scenarios as bounds for the probability. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being male is between 12% and 17%.

In summary:
{probability: between 0.12 and 0.17}
