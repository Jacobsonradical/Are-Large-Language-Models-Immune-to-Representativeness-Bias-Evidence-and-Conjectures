To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male, even if the attacker is actually female.

The probability of the witness erring is 20%. Since there are more females in the city (85%), the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is higher than the probability of erring and identifying a male as female.

Let F be the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male, and M be the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we have F + M = 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a randomly chosen person being female is 0.85. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is therefore F = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since there are fewer males in the city (15%), the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female is lower. Let's assume for now that M = 0.1.

Now, let's calculate the probability P(M) that the attacker is male. We know that the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female is M = 0.1. Therefore, the probability P(F) that the attacker is female is 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability P(M|M) that the attacker is male and the witness is correct is 1. The probability P(M|F) that the attacker is male and the witness is incorrect is M = 0.1.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is therefore P(M) * P(M|M) + P(F) * P(M|F) = 0.1 * 1 + 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.11.

However, this calculation assumes that the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female (M) is 0.1. Since we don't know if this is a reasonable assumption, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.

To get a more accurate estimate, we would need more information about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender under the specific conditions of the attack, or about the gender distribution of the attackers in the city.

Therefore, {probability: cannot be determined with the given information}
