To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The general population statistics give us a 15% chance that the attacker is male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, meaning they make correct guesses 80% of the time.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the attacker's gender based solely on the witness's identification. The witness's statement only adds an additional layer of evidence, but it does not necessarily overwrite the original probability.

Given that we do not have enough information to adjust the initial probability based on the witness's statement, our best estimate remains the initial probability of 15% that the attacker is male.
