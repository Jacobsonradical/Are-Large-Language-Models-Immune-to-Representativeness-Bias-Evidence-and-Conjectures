To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know whether the witness's errors favor male or female misidentifications. Without this information, we can't adjust the probability based on the gender distribution in the city.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

{probability: undetermined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
