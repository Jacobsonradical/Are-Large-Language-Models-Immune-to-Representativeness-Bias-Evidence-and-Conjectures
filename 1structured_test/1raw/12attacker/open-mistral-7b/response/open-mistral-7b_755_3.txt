The given information suggests that the majority of the population is female (85%), and the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's gender, but errs 20% of the time. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male.

The probability of the witness making a mistake when the actual gender is female (Type I error) is 20%. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as male when the attacker is indeed female is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the actual gender is male (Type II error) is 80%. Since 15% of the population is male, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as female when the attacker is indeed male is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 or 3%.

However, the witness did make an error, and since the error was identifying the attacker as male, it means the actual gender of the attacker is more likely to be male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.17 - 0.03 = 0.80 or 80%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.80}.
