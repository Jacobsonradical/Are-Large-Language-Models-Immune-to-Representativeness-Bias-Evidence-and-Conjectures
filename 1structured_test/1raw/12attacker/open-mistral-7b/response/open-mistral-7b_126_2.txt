To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

- Scenario 1: The attacker is actually male. In this case, the witness correctly identified the gender.
- Scenario 2: The attacker is actually female. In this case, the witness made an error in identifying the gender.

Given the population distribution, the probability of Scenario 1 (attacker is male) is 0.15 (15%). However, this probability might be affected by the witness's reliability. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can assume that when the witness identifies a person as male, there is a higher probability that the person is indeed male.

Let's calculate the probability of Scenario 1 given that the witness identified the attacker as male (P(Scenario 1 | witness's statement)).

P(Scenario 1 | witness's statement) = P(witness's statement | Scenario 1) * P(Scenario 1) / P(witness's statement)

P(witness's statement | Scenario 1) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(Scenario 1) = 0.15 (15%)

P(witness's statement) is the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as male. To calculate this, we need to consider both scenarios and their probabilities:

P(witness's statement) = P(witness's statement | Scenario 1) * P(Scenario 1) + P(witness's statement | Scenario 2) * P(Scenario 2)

P(witness's statement | Scenario 2) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (20%).

P(Scenario 2) = 0.85 (85%)

Now, we can calculate P(witness's statement):

P(witness's statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(Scenario 1 | witness's statement):

P(Scenario 1 | witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48.
