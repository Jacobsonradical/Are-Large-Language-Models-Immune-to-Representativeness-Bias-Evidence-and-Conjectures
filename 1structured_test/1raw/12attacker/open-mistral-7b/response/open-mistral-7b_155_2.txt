Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the population the witness is familiar with (half male and half female) is similar to the distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is given by: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the attacker being male and B is the witness's identification of a male attacker.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we can estimate based on the city's gender distribution (15% male).

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker if the attacker is indeed male, which we know is 80%.

P(B) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker regardless of the attacker's gender, which can be estimated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|Not A) * P(Not A) (where Not A is the attacker being female).

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|Not A) is 20%.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Not A) * P(Not A)
    = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.17
    = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
    = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
    = 0.2414

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
