To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). The probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is P(M) * 0.85 (since there are 85% females in the city). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is (1 - P(M)) * 0.15 (since there are 15% males in the city).

According to the information provided, the witness incorrectly identifies a gender 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a gender is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that the actual probability of the attacker being male, P(M), must satisfy the equation:

0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Solving for P(M), we get:

P(M) = (0.29 - 0.12) / 0.15 = 0.16

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.16} or 16%.
