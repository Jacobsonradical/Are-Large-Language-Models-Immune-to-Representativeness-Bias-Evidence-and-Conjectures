To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the proportion of male individuals the witness correctly identifies.

Let M be the proportion of males (0.15) and F be the proportion of females (0.85). The witness correctly identifies a male as male 0.8 * M times out of 100.

The total number of times the witness correctly identifies gender is 0.8F + 0.8M, so the expected proportion of times the witness identifies a male as male is (0.8 * M) / (0.8F + 0.8M).

We know that the witness identified the attacker as male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is the same as the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is (0.8 * M) / (0.8F + 0.8M).

Plugging in the values for F and M, we get:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15) = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
