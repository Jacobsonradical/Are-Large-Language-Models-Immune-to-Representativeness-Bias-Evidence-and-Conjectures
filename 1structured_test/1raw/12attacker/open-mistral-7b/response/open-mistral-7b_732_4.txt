To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

1. The witness's gender identification accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the city: The city's population is composed of 85% females and 15% males.

Since the witness's gender identification accuracy is not biased towards either gender (assuming equal performance for males and females), we can use this information to adjust the observed gender identification of the attacker.

1. Calculate the probability of a false positive (the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male): P(false positive) = 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.85 (proportion of females) = 0.17
2. Calculate the probability of a false negative (the witness mistakenly identifies a male as female): P(false negative) = 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.15 (proportion of males) = 0.03
3. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is given by the probability of a true positive, which is the complement of the probability of false positives and false negatives:

P(attacker is male) = 1 - P(false positive) - P(false negative)
P(attacker is male) = 1 - 0.17 - 0.03
P(attacker is male) = 0.80

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.80 or 80%.
