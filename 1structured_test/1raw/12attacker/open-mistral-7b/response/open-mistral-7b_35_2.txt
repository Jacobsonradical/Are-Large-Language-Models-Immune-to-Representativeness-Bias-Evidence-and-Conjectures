To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability, the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood, the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability, the probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence
- P(E) is the marginal likelihood, the probability of the evidence

We are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male, given the city's demographics)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (the probability of the evidence, which we can calculate)

We are not given P(E|~H), the probability of the evidence if the attacker is female, but we can calculate it using the information given:
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being female, given the city's demographics)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
     = 0.3448

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
