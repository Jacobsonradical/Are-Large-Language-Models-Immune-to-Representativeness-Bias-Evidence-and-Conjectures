Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Let's break this down:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have this information, we can assume it's equal to the gender distribution in the city, which is 15% (0.15) based on information b.
2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8 in information a.
3. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, given that the attacker is female. Since we don't have this information, we can assume it's equal to the probability that the witness would identify a female as male, which is given as 0.2 in information a.
4. P(H|E) is what we're trying to find: the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement.
5. P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement, which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H).

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

To compute this:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, given the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
