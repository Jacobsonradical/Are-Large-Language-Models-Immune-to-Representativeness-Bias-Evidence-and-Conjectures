To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. The population statistics: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's statement contradicts the population statistics. The witness identified the attacker as male, but according to the population statistics, the attacker should be more likely to be female.

Given that the witness's identification is not reliable in this case (as it contradicts the population statistics), we should not rely on the witness's statement alone. Instead, we should use the population statistics as our best estimate.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 15%, based on the city's population statistics.

{probability: 0.15}
