Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The attacker's gender is unknown, but the city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = [P(Witness's Gender Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / [P(Witness's Gender Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness's Gender Identification | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

1. P(Witness's Gender Identification | Attacker is Male) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
2. P(Attacker is Male) = 0.15 (The city's population is 15% male)
3. P(Witness's Gender Identification | Attacker is Female) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female 20% of the time)
4. P(Attacker is Female) = 0.85 (The city's population is 85% female)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
