To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

First, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is actually female given the population statistics:

Probability of attacker being female = Population percentage of females
                                                   = 0.85

Now, let's consider the witness's reliability. Given that the witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time, when they identify someone as male, there is a 20% chance that they are actually misidentifying a female. This means that when the witness identifies someone as male, the true gender is male 80% of the time and female 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness was correct, which is 0.8 (80%).

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8}

This means that according to the given information, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is male. However, it's important to note that this is a probability based on the specific conditions given and may not be reflective of actual real-world scenarios.
