To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement about the attacker's gender.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- Ā: the event that the attacker is female
- E: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = probability that the attacker is male = unknown (we want to find this)
- P(Ā) = probability that the attacker is female = 1 - P(A)
- P(E|A) = probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male = 0.8
- P(E|Ā) = probability that the witness identifies a female attacker as male = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8) * P(A) / [(0.8) * P(A) + (0.15) * (1 - P(A))]

Since we don't know P(A), we cannot directly compute the probability P(A|E). However, we can express P(A|E) as a function of P(A). To find the value of P(A) that makes P(A|E) equal to 0.5 (which is our best guess given the limited information), we can solve for P(A) in the equation:

0.5 = (0.8) * P(A) / [(0.8) * P(A) + (0.15) * (1 - P(A))]

After some algebra, we find that P(A) ≈ 0.29.

So, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29, or 29%.
