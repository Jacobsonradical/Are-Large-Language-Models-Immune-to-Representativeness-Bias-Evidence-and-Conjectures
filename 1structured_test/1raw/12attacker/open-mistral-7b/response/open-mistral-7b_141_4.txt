Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. This means that the prior probability of an attacker being male is 0.15 (or 15%).

2. The witness's testimony indicates that they have a 80% success rate in correctly identifying gender and a 20% error rate. Since they identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event occurring given that the attacker is actually male is 0.8 (or 80%).

3. However, since the witness also has a 20% error rate, there is a chance that they mistakenly identified the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female. The probability of this event occurring is 0.2 (or 20%).

4. To find the overall probability of the attacker being male given both sources of evidence, we need to consider both the prior probability and the likelihood of the witness's testimony. We can do this using Bayes' theorem:

   P(Attacker is male | Witness's testimony) = P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) / [P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

   Plugging in the values, we get:

   P(Attacker is male | Witness's testimony) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.04] = 0.12 / 0.16 = 0.75

So, based on both the population statistics and the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.75 (or 75%).
