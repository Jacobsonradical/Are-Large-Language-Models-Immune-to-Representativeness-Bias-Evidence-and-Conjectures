Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for calculating conditional probabilities, and it can be used to calculate the probability of an event A given some evidence E. In this case, A is the attacker being male, and E is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We have the following values:

1. P(E|A) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is given as 0.8 (or 80%) in the first piece of information.
2. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we need to estimate.
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness's identification being correct, regardless of the attacker's gender. To calculate this, we multiply P(E|A) by P(A) (the probability of an attacker being male) and P(E|not A) by P(not A) (the probability of an attacker being female), then add these two probabilities together:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(E|not A) is unknown (but since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can estimate it as 0.2). We also know P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of an attacker being male in the general population) and P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can substitute these values into the equation for P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, based on the witness's identification and the population composition, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
