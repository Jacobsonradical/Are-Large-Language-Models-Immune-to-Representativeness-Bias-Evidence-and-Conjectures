To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probabilistic formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male,
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female,
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker,
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can assume that P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

According to the given information, we also know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the results, we find that P(M|w) â‰ˆ 0.198 or about 19.8%.

So, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 19.8%.
