Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's testimony. The prior probability (P(H)) is the probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence, and the likelihood (P(E|H)) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. Let's assume that the true gender distribution in the city is the same as the population distribution (85% female and 15% male), which is given in the second piece of information.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, E is the evidence (witness's testimony), and ~H is the complementary hypothesis (the attacker is female).

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8

2. P(~E|H): This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male attacker as female. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, P(~E|H) = 0.2

3. P(H): This is the prior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is male before considering the witness's testimony. Given that 15% of the population is male, P(H) = 0.15

4. P(~H): This is the probability that the attacker is female before considering the witness's testimony. Given that 85% of the population is female, P(~H) = 0.85

5. P(E|~H): This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a female attacker as female. Since we don't have this information, let's assume it's the same as P(E|H) for simplicity (though this might not be the best assumption).

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1176

So, given the witness's testimony and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.76%.
