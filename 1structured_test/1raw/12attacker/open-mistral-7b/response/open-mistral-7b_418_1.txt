To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors systematically favor one gender over the other. The information provided does not indicate whether the 20% error rate includes misidentifications of males as females or vice versa.

Without this information, we cannot make a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can make an educated guess based on the gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female, it could be argued that the witness's erroneous identifications might be more likely to involve misidentifying males as females, given the prevalence of females in the city. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male might be higher than 80%.

On the other hand, if the witness's errors are equally likely to involve misidentifying males as females and females as males, then the probability of the attacker being male would be 80%.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the best answer I can give, based on the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate and the actual probability might be higher or lower}
