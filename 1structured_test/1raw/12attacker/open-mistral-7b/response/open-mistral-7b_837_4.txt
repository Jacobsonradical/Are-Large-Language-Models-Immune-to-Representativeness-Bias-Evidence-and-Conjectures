Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, there's an assumption not explicitly stated, which is whether the witness's error rate is the same for both male and female identifications or if it varies. Without this information, we can't make a precise calculation.

Assuming the error rate is the same for both genders (which might not be the case, given that people often have a bias towards identifying others as their own gender), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

P(Attacker is male | Witness's identification) = [P(Witness identifies as male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness identifies as male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness identifies as female) * P(Attacker is female)]

Let's break this down:

1. P(Witness identifies as male) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
2. P(Attacker is male) = Unknown, let's denote it as x
3. P(Witness identifies as female) = 1 - P(Witness identifies as male) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
4. P(Attacker is female) = 1 - P(Attacker is male) = 1 - x

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

0.8 * x / (0.8 * x + 0.2 * (1 - x))

Without knowing the value of x, we can't provide a specific number. You would need additional information or assumptions to estimate this probability.
